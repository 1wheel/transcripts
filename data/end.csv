In addition I would like to call your attention that our Q1 2006 earnings time will begin at the close of Friday, March 10.  Before we begin today's call, I would like to caution everyone that we will be making forward-looking statements about Management's expectations.  Investors are cautioned that our forward-looking statements involve risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from our current expectations as set forth in the forward-looking statements.  Semi-conductor industry is generally volatile and market conditions are particularly difficult to forecast.  Because our actual results may differ materially from our plans and expectations today, I encourage you to review our filings with the SEC where we discuss in detail, our business and risk factors, setting forth information that would cause actual results to differ materially from those in our forward-looking statements.  You will find detailed discussions in our most recent SEC filings, including AMD's annual report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 25th, 2004 and AMD's quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ended September 25th, 2005. With that, I'll turn over to Hector Ruiz.  Hector Ruiz, Chairman, President, CEO  Thank you, Mike.  Our fourth quarter results underscore the undeniable fact that the AMD growth engine is gathering momentum.  The strong approach of our execution led the Company to records in total revenues, micro processor units and revenues across each of our server, mobile and desktop product lines, as well as micro processor gross margin and operating income.  Our solid ASP improvement confirms the rise of AMD as a premium brand for both consumer and commercial customers alike.  And our JV expansion successfully completed a public offering.  Review to the timely capital infusion for that business and allow an AMD to bring increasing focus to the growth opportunity in front us.  In our micro processor business, we experienced almost 80% year on year growth in what continues to be the largest quarter of the seasonal cycle.  We continue our strong projectory in the enterprise for the superior performance for the characteristics of the AMD Opteron platform drive unprecedented opportunities for our customers and partners.  In the fourth quarter, we were pleased to add AIG, Albertson's, Clear Channel, and Nissan Motor Company, among others to our expanded list of Global 2000 companies and their subsidiaries who have adopted AMD 64 technology.  As of today, 90% of the top 100, and more than 45% of the top 500 companies on the force Global 2000 use AMD base solutions.  We're thrilled to report that eBay is bolstering the search functionality on its site with hundreds of Sun's new AMD Opteron processor-based Sunfire x64 servers.  EBay will combine the power and performance of the Solaris operating system running on AMD Opteron processors for better performance and energy efficiency.  AMD's Opteron model 880 with true Dual Core technology continues to lead the industry in TPCC benchmark performance for 4P servers.  Customer momentum in the commercial segment continued with the launch of the HP dx5150 clients and new blade server offerings from HP and Fujitsu Siemens.  We're also pleased that Supermicro announced general availability of a broad wide range of AMD Opteron based server and motherboard blade solutions.  Our mobile business continues to gain steam, reflected by all time record revenue in the quarter and continued growth in global demands for AMD's Turion 64 mobile processor platform.  We are pleased to report over 100 platforms based on AMD's Turion 64 processors are either shipping or in development worldwide.  AMD continues to show strong progress in key high growth markets, particularly China, one of our largest and fastest growing markets.  We were honored to announce broader option of our platform by Tsinghua Tongfang China’s third largest PC maker.  In addition, we licensed our low power AMD Geode GX2 processor to the esteemed Ministry of Science and Technology and to Peking University for use in developing new technologies to support primary education in rural China.  Our AMD64 base products continue to earn industry recognition, receiving 20 more awards in the fourth quarter, including the Tech Innovator Award from VARBusiness, Gear of the Year recognition by Maximum PC and acknowledgement as one of the hot products of the year by EDN Magazine.  Each of these awards was for our best-in-class AMD64 dual core technology, the only industry standard microprocessor family designed from the ground up for multi-core computing.  On the manufacturing side, our Dresden team continues it excellent performance record, both in terms of the continued operation of our World Class FAB 30, as well as in ramping our new state of the art 300mm FAB 36, which more than doubles our capacity in the next 3 years.  By all measures, the fourth quarter was outstanding, characterized by accelerating customer and end user adoption of our AMD64 platform micro-server mobile and desktop product lines, the successful public offering of our expansion business, flawless manufacturing execution in our FAB 30 and the grand opening of our new FAB 36 facility in Dresden, Germany, as well.  Superb execution of our financial strategy, with a reduction of debt and the expansion of our cash balances.  It was a spectacular end to a year of reinvention for AMD, providing once again a healthy foundation for continued growth and success in 2006.  Now let me turn it over to Bob to review the results for the quarter, as well as the outlook.  Bob Rivet, Chief Financial Officer  Thanks, Hector.  AMD had an excellent quarter including: Continuing market share gains in server, mobile and desktop markets; continued growing demand within the commercial sector for not only AMD-based server offerings, but for AMD based mobile and desk top offerings as well; improvements to the balance sheet, including a reduction in debt of $639 million, and year-end cash and short-term investment balances increasing to $1.8 billion and the successful IPO expansion which closed on December 21st.  And financially, we reported another very strong operating quarter.  Before I review the operating statement detail, let me mention that the completion of the Spansion Flash Memory IPO requires several changes to our reporting.  So I want to take some time to help you understand both our reported results and the way model our business going forward.  So in addition to our GAAP consolidated financials, I will also discuss non-GAAP results.  For your convenience, we have included within our press release a new table which reconciles AMD going forward to the consolidated GAAP figures.  I would like to take a few moments to walk you through this table labeled 1.6 in the press release.  The first column shows our fourth quarter GAAP results including total consolidated sales, of $1.84 billion, up 45% from the fourth quarter of last year and up 21% compared to the third quarter of 2005.  Net income was $96 million or $0.21 per share.  This data includes 86 days of Spansion's results before the IPO, and also a non-cash charge of $110 million.  The third column shows non-GAAP results, excluding the $110 million non-cash, loss on ownership dilution in Spansion, which results in an EPS of $0.45.  Column 4 shows the impact of the Memory segment in Spansion on each line of AMD's financial statements, which totals a negative impact on net income of $39 million.  The fifth column reclassifies the net impact of the $39 million from each line item to one line item.  Excluding this line, the Company's operating results are presented in a forum that will be more consistent with the presentation of future results.  Fourth quarter sales of $1.35 billion, a 34% increase compared to the third quarter of 2005 and a 78% increase compared to the fourth quarter of 2004.  Gross margin was 57%.  SG&A was 18% of sales; R&D was 19% of sales.  Operating income was $268 million.  The Memory segment of Spansion on net income was a negative $39 million.  Net income for the quarter is still 205 million or $0.45 per share.  Switching to the business segment highlights, CPG sales were $1.31 billion, another new record, and a 79% increase over the same period a year ago.  We also grow 35 percentage points for the third quarter of this year.  Our strong micro processor sales indicate that we once again took share across the server, mobile and desktop product offerings, particularly in the performance segment, as indicated by our ASP growth.  Unit sales in the quarter increased by 27% quarter-on-quarter, and we saw a 6% improvement in average selling price.  Server, mobile, and desktop processor sales each grew significantly compared to the third quarter of 2005.  Mobile processor sales growth was driven by increased shipments of AMD Turion 64 processors.  Server and desktop sales growth were driven in particular by increased customer adoption of Dual Core AMD processors.  Geographically, processor sales were especially strong in North America, Europe and Greater China; and distribution in consumer and commercial channels are reporting very lean AMD inventories worldwide.  CPG's operating income of $287 million established another new record in the quarter, up again from the record levels of the third quarter of 2005.  Included within CPG's results are the bonus and profit sharing accruals that had previously been included in the all other segment.  With the deconsolidation of Spansion, we have reclassified and confirmed these expenses into the specific business segments that earned them, primarily CPG.  Net income impact to the Memory segment and Spansion at AMD was a negative $39 million, as I mentioned.  Again, Column 5 provides an outline of how AMD would have looked in the fourth quarter when you exclude the Memory segment results and all Spansion related charges.  Going forward, you will see a line item called \"Equity and Net Income of Subsidiary\" below the \"Interest, Income and Expense\" lines reflecting our current 37.9% ownership in Spansion results.  Turning to the balance sheet, the year end balance sheet reflects the deconsolidation of Spansion into the line item \"Investment and Subsidiaries.\" Our cash balance was $1.8 billion up $452 million compared with the third quarter.  This increase was due to cash flow from operations and loan pay offs from Spansion.  Debt was reduced by $639 million compared with the third quarter.  This includes the $201 million convertible debt conversion and approximately $440 million of Spansion debt moving off our balance sheet.  AMD's debt to capital ratio finished the year at 28%, good progress toward our target of 20%.  Fourth quarter capital expenditures, excluding the Memory business was 250 million -- $250 million for AMD.  Inventory declined as a result of the Spansion IPO and a $61 million reduction in AMD processor's inventory.  Now I would like to discuss the outlook.  AMD's outlook statement for the first quarter and full year of 2006 are based on current expectations and do not include Spansion.  The following statements are forward-looking, and actual results could differ materially depending on market conditions.  AMD expects first quarter 2006 sales to be flat to down slightly compared to the 1.35 billion in the fourth quarter of 2005.  If achieved, this would approach a 70% increase from -- from comparable sales in the first quarter of 2005.  Operating expenses, which include R&D and SG&A will increase by approximately 6% compared with the $506 million in the fourth quarter of 2005.  Stock option expense in the first quarter will be approximately $16 million at the current share price.  And finally, a reminder, the line \"Equity and Net Income of Subsidiary\" should be modeled using our current Spansion ownership of 37.9% multiplied by your estimate of Spansion's quarterly net income going forward.  For the full year 2006, you should be modeling capital expenditures of approximately $1.4 billion; depreciation and amortization will be approximately $825 million; the tax rate within a 10 to 15% range; and I also wanted to call your attention that we will have an extra week in our fiscal 2006, which we will take in the second quarter of this year.  In summary, 2005 was a very good year.  We made significant strides in taking market share, improving our operating results and strengthening the balance sheet.  We believe that we are very well positioned for 2006.  And with that, I'll hand it back to Hector.  Hector Ruiz, Chairman, President, CEO  Thank you, Bob.  We began 2006 with more momentum and higher quality momentum than at any other time in our history.  Revenue is not just growing, it is accelerating.  Platform adoption has never been stronger particularly among the world's most respected OEMs and industry partners.  Our marketing capabilities are now recognized as world class and our global footprint is getting stronger every day.  The industry is helping.  Customers and partners that have elected to partner with AMD are seeing the opportunities that come from providing the freedom of choice to their customers.  We have seized the mantle of the technology leadership in our industry and are continuing to distance ourselves from the competition.  In our world class Dresden operation, the new ramp of our new FAB 36 is going extremely well.  Production started late last year; yields are outstanding and beginning to approach the 530 levels.  Production shipments are expected to begin before the end of this quarter.  We are methodically marching toward the substantial expansion of our capacity in preparation for a significant sustainable increase in worldwide market share.  We have not peaked; this is just another stage in our climb to greatness.  We are poised and ready to gain even more share.  And consistent with the revenue and profitable growth engine that we have become; we have positioned ourselves to grow at least at twice the rate of the industry.  Once again I want to thank each and every AMD employee for remaining major focused on the task of creating the world's most innovative semiconductor products and technologies.  We remain highly motivated by the prospects of helping to create a marketplace that is better for our customers, partners and end users worldwide, and we are very encouraged that our industry is showing a strong desire to break free from the artificial competitive barriers that have constrained all of us to date.  Thank you.  And I would like now to turn it over to Mike Haase for the Question & Answer session.  Mike Hasse, Director, IR  Thanks, Hector.  Operator we will begin the Q&A forum please.  "
"5715","NSRGY","Q3","2005","        NESTLÉ S.A.     2005  9 MONTHS SALES CONFERENCE CALL TRANSCRIPT      Conference Date: 20 October 2005     Nestlé S.A.     Roddy Child-Villiers - Nestlé S.A. Head of Investor Relations      Slide 1     Good  morning,  ladies  and  gentlemen,  and  welcome  to  the  Nestlé  9  months  sales  conference  call.  As  usual,  I  will  discuss  the  key  numbers  only,  leaving  more  time  for  questions….     Slide 2     ... and I will take this first slide covering the safe harbour statement, as read, and will move  directly to the highlights.     Slide 3     The  key  message  is  that,  even  in  a  tough  environment,  our  strategy  is  delivering,  as  demonstrated  by  an  organic growth  of  5.8%,  and  RIG, or real  internal  growth,  of  3.8%.   And this is not just due to our Pharmaceutical activities:- the Food and Beverage business  achieved organic growth of 5.6% and RIG of 3.5%.  These numbers, which are the result  of a broad based, robust performance across the different regions and product categories,  demonstrate the strong growth characteristics of our core food and beverage business.     That  strength  is  underlined  by  positive  organic  growth  from  each  of  our  four  food  and  beverage  reporting  areas:- Europe  maintained  its  positive  organic  growth,  whilst  the  Americas continued to be strong at 7.3%, Zone Asia Oceania and Africa improved to 7%  and  Nestlé  Waters  improved  to  8.4%.  Other  activities  achieved  an  organic  growth  of  10.7%.     Pricing was 2%, as we attempted to recover increased input costs in certain categories.  It  was particularly strong in Milk products, Soluble coffee, Nutrition, and Roast and Ground  Coffee. We continued to see pricing pressure in Nestlé Waters and Japan, as well as in      Brazil due to the tax change there.  These three businesses together represent over 10  billion of our 68 billion Swiss francs of sales at the 9 month stage, so it is fair to say that  the 2% group pricing number understates the level of pricing taken elsewhere.     Slide 4     This next slide gives you the breakdown of the sales evolution.  Reported sales increased  4.8% to 67.7 billion Swiss Francs.  I've already touched on the strong organic growth and  RIG.  We had a negative impact from disposals, net of acquisitions, of 0.8%, that number  made up of a positive 0.8% contribution from acquisitions, mainly Wagner, and a negative  1.6% contribution from disposals, primarily Eismann.  We are almost able to report a flat  impact  from  foreign  exchange,  that  number  coming  in  at  minus  0.2%,  an  improvement  from minus 1.8% at the half year.     Slide 5     On the next slide are the key currencies.  A mixed picture compared to the same period of  last year, although the good news is that the Euro and US dollar are not so far away from  their average rates for the full year 2004.     Slide 6     Moving now to a bit more detail on the Zones.       Zone Europe had organic growth of 1.6%, a slight improvement over the 1.5% at the half  year.  There is no change in the market trends in Europe.  That is to say, conditions have  remained  tough.  Overall,  we  have  maintained  our  market  shares,  and  I  include  the  impacts of private label and hard discounters in that comment.  We did best in PetCare  and Soluble coffee, as well as Frozen Food, and worst in Chilled Dairy, due to France and  Spain, and in Chocolate, due to Russia.     In the Americas the US continued strong, and there was an acceleration in Brazil.     Zone Asia, Oceania, Africa, or AOA, achieved the strongest performance of the Zones in  the third quarter, with an improvement in the cumulative organic growth from 6% to 7%.       I am pleased to be able to report that our predictions at the half year for Zone AOA have  proven to be accurate:- the Middle East and South Asia continued to perform well, as we  had  forecast,  whilst  South Africa,  the  Philippines  and  Japan  all  achieved  an  improved  performance, as promised.      There were some expressions of disappointment at the Half Year about the growth rates in Nestlé's emerging markets.  I hope that the performance in the third quarter in AOA and Brazil will put people's minds at rest. The Nestlé emerging market story is as strong and  as rich in potential as ever it was.     Slide 7     Now  I  will  go  into  the  detail  of  the  organic  growth  performance  by  market, starting  in Europe,  with  Germany.  My  comments  on  the  performance  of  the  categories  within  the  markets are all based on RIG numbers for those categories.       Germany was slightly lower at 0.5% organic growth.  There was a mixed performance by  category, with Culinary and Frozen Food improving, but Ice cream a bit weaker.  Soluble  coffee continued to be the best performing category cumulatively.       In France also, there were some improvements and some that were slower, leading to an  overall  acceleration from  0.2%  negative  organic  growth  to  1.2%  positive.  Among  those  that accelerated were Frozen Food, Soluble coffee and Ice cream.  There was also a good  performance from our Foodservice business.       Great  Britain  was  the  strongest  cumulative  performer  in  Western  Europe,  with  5.9%  organic growth.  Chocolate was a bit weaker but Soluble coffee accelerated a little.  We do  expect to see a slight slowdown in coffee to the year end.       For our British-based listeners, the exciting news in Frozen Food is that Hot Pockets will  be launched there this quarter, following successful introductions in France, Germany and  Spain.     PetCare  Europe  achieved  a  strong  acceleration  since  the  half  year  to  4.3%  organic  growth.     In  the  East,  Russia  has  continued  to  be  weak.  That  said,  things  are  looking  up  and  I  expect  that  we  will  return  to  historic  growth  rates  next  year.  There  are  a  number  of  reasons to support this belief: first of all, the  market shares tell a good story: our coffee  shares  have  been  showing  consistent  gains  through  2005,  whilst  we  have  halted  the  decline in Chocolate.  We have cleaned out chocolate stocks in the trade and discontinued  relationships  with  about  40%  of  our  distributors.  This  means  that  we  will  be  selling  to  consumer demand, rather than to distributor orders.  Also, key  measures such as credit  days and working capital have improved significantly,  whilst profitability continues above  Group average.     Slide 8     In  the  Americas,  the  US  was  unchanged  from  the  half  year,  Frozen  food,  including Stouffer's, Lean Cuisine and Hot Pockets, Shelf stable dairy, particularly Coffee-mate, and Ready-to-Drink beverages continued strong.  Nesquik is doing particularly well in schools,  as the  carbonated  soft  drink  manufacturers  pull  out.  We  have  put  about  5,000  vending  machines into schools for Nesquik.     Petcare  North  America  remains  strong  at  6.9%  organic  growth.  Dreyer's  accelerated  somewhat to 9.5% organic growth.       Canada  also  accelerated slightly,  with  Chocolate  particularly  strong  in  the  third  quarter,  benefiting from a good sell-in ahead of Halloween.       In  Latin  America,  Brazil  accelerated  sharply  to  5.2%  organic  growth,  with  good  performances  from  the  three  biggest  categories,  Shelf  stable  dairy,  particularly  Ninho,  Powdered beverages, particularly Nescau, and Chocolate.  This acceleration by Chocolate  confirms our comment at the half  year that the 2nd quarter slowdown in Chocolate was  simply due to the timing of Easter.     Mexico went in the opposite direction from Brazil, being weaker across most categories as  input cost-driven  pricing  slowed  the  RIG.  That  said,  organic  growth  of  9.1%  is  an  impressive performance.       The smaller regions in Latin America performed well.     Slide 9     Moving to Zone AOA, Japan's RIG is now positive 1%, although organic growth remains at  minus 1.1%.  We achieved positive cumulative RIG and share gains in Soluble coffee, with  new  pouch  packaging  and  the  launch  of  a Mild  Excella  the  catalysts.  There  was  also  continued strong growth in Chocolate.     In  the  Philippines  the  organic  growth  increased from  under  5%  to  7.4%,  with  a  good  improvement in Soluble coffee, but I  should remind you that this market is up against a  very strong final quarter comparison.      Africa's organic growth increased to 6.5%, from 2% in June.  Both the Central/West and South/East regions contributed to the improvement.  The Middle East continued to perform  well, with 13% organic growth.      That said, I expect that all eyes were on China following the product exchange earlier in  the year.  The organic growth in China halved from 7.5% at the half year to 3.7%.  The  good news, however, is that we achieved nearly 8% growth in September, so the signs are  that  we  are  over  the  worst,  as  our  investment  in communication  starts  to  pay  growth  dividends.  Shelf stable dairy actually had a higher cumulative 9 month RIG than it did at  the  6  month  stage.  The  situation  is  rather  different  in  Infant  Formula  which  is  recommended by doctors and is not therefore supported by consumer communication: the  recovery in this category may therefore be slower.       I  will repeat our half year forecast that we hope to be back to normal levels of growth in China in the second half of next year.     Slide 10     Nestlé  Waters  achieved  a  strong  acceleration  from  the  half  year  to  9%  RIG.  Organic  growth, at 8.4%, reflected negative pricing.  Europe was about flat but both North America  and the rest of the world were particularly strong, growing at about 17%.     Slide 11     In  the  Other  Activities,  there  were  once again strong performances  from  Alcon, at  9.8%  organic growth, and Nespresso, at around 30%.  If Nespresso continues at this pace, it will  be a one billion Swiss Franc brand by the end of 2006.  Just for your information, the sales  of Other activities are about 75% Pharmaceutical and 25% Food and Beverage.     Slide 12     Turning now to the product groups and starting with Beverages.     I  have  just  discussed  Waters,  which  contributed  to  an  improved  organic  growth  for Beverages of 7.8%.     Soluble coffee's organic growth accelerated from 5.7% to 6.7%, reflecting strong pricing, as  well  as  improved  RIG  in  Japan.  You  have  probably  heard  the  main  news  in  this  segment, which is the launch of Partners Blend in the UK.  This has had a good reception  from the retailers.      The other Beverage categories, Powdered beverages and Ready to drink beverages, have  also performed well over the 9 months. In the powdered segment, Nesquik is doing well in  Europe following its relaunch with added vitamins and minerals.  Ready to drink beverages  was particularly strong in the US.  There was also a good performance from Beverages  Partners Worldwide with 10% organic growth.  Nestea is performing particularly well.     In Milk products, Nutrition and Ice Cream, there was a slight increase in organic growth to  5.5%, driven by pricing.       Milk  products  improved  its  organic  growth  to  5.7%,  with  Shelf  stable  near  double  digit,  which  tells  you  that  growth  in  Chilled  Dairy  continued  to  be  negative.  In  Shelf  Stable,  Mexico was weaker but in line with the market, and this was more than compensated by  improvements in Brazil, the US, the Philippines and elsewhere.     Nutrition reached 4.9% organic growth, clearly impacted by the situation in China.  Infant  nutrition slipped back despite good performances in many markets, demonstrated by RIG  of 9.4% in the Americas. Healthcare nutrition was over 10% organic, whilst Performance  nutrition continued to be held back, primarily by tough comps with 2004.     Ice cream dipped to 5.5%, due to a slowdown in Europe.  The Americas continued strong,  with Dreyer's delivering over 10% RIG.  There was good growth also in Zone AOA.  Nestlé  is  now  the  leader  in  the  majority  of  the  markets  around  the  world  were  it  is  present,  including the US.     Cereal Partners Worldwide was unchanged from the half year.     Next  is  Prepared  dishes  and  cooking  aids,  where  there  was  an  acceleration  to  4.2%  organic growth. Both sub-categories accelerated during the third quarter.     Chocolate,  confectionery  and  biscuits  accelerated  slightly  to  2.7%  organic  growth.       Chocolate improved due to Brazil, France and Germany. It continued strong in AOA, with  8% RIG.  Sugar was less negative due to the US, whilst Biscuits improved significantly due  to Brazil.     PetCare was practically unchanged at 5.2% organic growth, with Europe a bit faster and North America a bit slower, as discussed on the zone slides.     As  usual,  there  is  a  strong  finish  to  the  product  groups  with  Pharmaceutical  products  slightly higher than in June, at 9.4% organic growth.     Slide 13     I  am not  intending to  get drawn  into  a  margin debate on this sales call, but  I  thought  it  would be useful to update you on the raw material environment.  Inflationary pressure has  continued in the second half of 2005, and the cost pressure remains significant for Nestlé.   Our response has been continued pricing activity, demonstrated by the 2% group number,  as well as a continued focus on our savings initiatives.  You saw that in the first half we  were able to compensate for most of this cost pressure.     Turning to our prospects for the rest of 2005, I can confirm that the Nestlé Model of strong  organic  growth  combined  with  sustainable  margin  improvement  remains  secure  for  the  year. For 2005, we will deliver our target of organic growth of between 5 and 6% combined  with an improvement in constant currency margins.      The other good news is that the 2005 share buy-back is 80% complete.  This means that a  second programme can be proposed to the Board of Directors.     Thank you for your attention.  I would be happy now to take your questions.     Slide 14         Q&A Session       Questions on:	Share buy back & Price increases     Sylvain Massot, Morgan Stanley     Following  up  on  what  you  said  on  buy  back,  in  the  presentation  you  are  talking  about  acceleration in 2006, maybe you can elaborate a little bit more on that. The second thing is  on the price increase, we have seen the acceleration in prices all along the year, are you still  taking price increases I am thinking about categories like Water in the US, what should we  expect in terms of pricing in the next few quarters.     Roddy Child-Villiers     On the buy back the next Board meeting is in November and the proposal we made to the Board at that time, I can’t at this stage give you any guidance on the size.  They are already  forecasts in the market and I can’t give you any further guidance. On the pricing aspect, you  mentioned Nestlé Waters, in North America we have tried some slight pricing increases but  we  have  made  it  very  clear  that  we  are  not  prepared  to  sacrifice  market  share.  So  the  sustainability  of  those  pricing  increases  depends  on  the  competitive  reaction.  Elsewhere  there are some continued price increases in Milk so we are still taking price increases where  the input costs demanded.     Sylvain Massot, Morgan Stanley     Maybe  just  to  follow  up  on  this,  can  you  tell  us  whether  there  are  any  areas  where  you  experience  some  resistance,  some  pull  back  on  prices  because  clearly  the  third  quarter  results show that you get good RIG and a very strong pricing.  Maybe you can elaborate a bit  more on where pricing is more difficult other than water?     Roddy Child-Villiers     I  think  we  have already  covered it.  Really  is  Japan,  it  is  the  most  difficult  market  for  us in  terms of pricing.  US Water has  been  difficult  and  as I said,  it depends on the competitive  reaction really, I think those are the two main issues.     Questions on:	Petcare in Europe and North American Water business     Arnaud Langlois, JP Morgan    First could you talk a bit about the Pet Care business in Europe, it seems that it had a really  good acceleration in Q3, and also I had a question about the North American Water business  which  has  seen a stable  acceleration  in  Q3.  I  would  like  to  know  whether  you see that as  sustainable  or  whether  this  was  influenced  by  what  happened  in  the  first  half  of  the  US,  especially  hurricanes,  have we  seen  any stockpiling  from consumers.  And obviously could  you also elaborate a bit on the margin impact of this. Have you seen any margin pressure in  the North American Water business.     Roddy Child-Villiers     Regarding Pet Care in Europe. There has been a good performance generally speaking, we  have increased shares in the UK and France in particular, we are now the market leader in  France.  We  have  also  increased  shares  in  Italy  and  Spain,  double  digit  growth  has  been  achieved in most of the eastern European countries as well as in Switzerland. The growth is  as it was at the half year, is primarily in the higher value brands such as Bakers, Pro Plan,  VB/ONE, Darling is doing very well in Russia particularly, and also in the Single Serve Wet Cat segment.       Turning to Waters I can’t make any comment for you on the margin on Waters at this stage.      In terms of North America the category remains dynamic, we seeing PET (category of small  formats) up year to date by 25% the total category up about 14%, the performance is pretty  broad based so I don’t think it is necessarily related just to the hurricanes. When I say broad  based  it  is  broad  based  in  so  far  as  it  applies  to  Pure  Life,  and  also  applies  to  our  international brands and the regional brands.  I don’t think people would go out and by Perrier  just because there is a hurricane.     On the market share, our market share is up about 0.6% over the year.     Questions on:	Nespresso growth & Infant products in China     Thomas Russo, Gardner Russo & Gardner      Did  you  say  that  the  share  re-purchase  was  80  or  18%  complete  on  the  billion  dollar  authorization year to date.     Roddy Child-Villiers     80%.     Thomas Russo, Gardner Russo & Gardner      Terrific,  congratulations.  The  question  about  Nespresso  which  seems  to  grow  at  quite  a  sharp  impressive  rate.  It  seems to  be  growing  at  an  accelerating  rate  as  it  gains  in  size.   Could  you  talk  a  bit  about  the  mix  between  equipment  sales  and  capsule  sales,  roll  out  facilities and the way it is gaining traction and showing an accelerated growth?     Roddy Child-Villiers     I think Nespresso has been around 30% for a long time now.  Talking to Henk Kwakman who  runs the Coffee SBU and used to run Nespresso some years back, his forecasts then was a  30%  growth  and  he  was telling  me  that  he had done  that  year  in and  year out  and  would  continue to do it year in, year out.  Clearly we have rolled out into more countries and that  obviously gives it a broader footprint and opportunities for growth.  But, it is clear that we are  not seeing in that business any impact from the introduction of lower priced coffee machines  by other players in the market.  But the sales reflect the sales of the capsules.     Thomas Russo, Gardner Russo & Gardner      Wonderful, so that’s increasingly the capsule shares that you are showing?     Roddy Child-Villiers     Exactly.     Thomas Russo, Gardner Russo & Gardner     In China the infant formula issue in relation to doctor prescribed products, nonetheless as I  toured China in early February through Walmart I seemed to see quite a strong offering of the  product on display at Walmart so it maybe doctor prescribed but it seems to be available at  the standard retailer.  How does that allow you to market on the premises, or at the retailer  independent of the doctor or is it indeed only a prescription product?     Roddy Child-Villiers     There’s a difference between the Infant formula products and the Growing Up milks. I think  what you are seeing in Walmart would be the growing up milks, the Infant Formula milks, the  ones for new born babies where the mother is not able to breast feed and it is those infant products that are recommended by doctors and are subject to WHO regulations, there is no  marketing.  But then, as I say the Growing Up Milks that you are seeing in Walmart, those are  the  milk products that are benefiting  from the consumer communication.  So it is a market  segmentation issue effectively.     Thomas Russo, Gardner Russo & Gardner     Thank you, congratulations on a great set of numbers.     Roddy Child-Villiers     Thanks very much. For everyone’s information you can follow the buy back on our web site.  Each week we publish the latest state of play in terms of shares bought back.     Question on:	Margin Targets for the full year     Martin Dolan, Execution Limited               On the reconfirmation of the margin target by Mr Brabeck for the full year, can we assume  that margins to the end of Q3 are in line with your expectations and that this comment takes  into account any higher input costs from the US due to Hurricane Katrina?     Roddy Child-Villiers     You can assume what you like, but our margin forecast is based on the discussions that the Executive Board had in terms of past performance and the outlook for the rest of the year.      And  we are  comfortable  that  we  can  achieve  our  EBITA  margin  improvement  at constant  currency.     Question on:	Raw Material costs     Julian Hardwick, ABN Amro     Could you talk a bit more about some of the raw material cost trends that you are seeing, I  am particularly interested because the wire services are reporting Mr Brabeck as saying that  he  sees  less  pressure  on  raw  material prices  next  year,  which  would  seem  to  be  a slight  contrast  with  comments  coming  from  some  of  your  peers.  Could  you  just  give  us  a  run  through of the key drivers here?     Roddy Child-Villiers     I am always talking about 2005 rather than 2006.  You might remember that at the half year  we showed you an index of weighted average of raw material prices that covered the bulk of  our traded raw materials.  Since the half year that index has continued to rise. We are seeing  particularly  cost  increases  in  PET  and  energy  as  you  would  expect  and  also  some  cost  increases in coffee, albeit that we obviously have some cover in place.  It is fundamentally  the oil ones that are the most dramatic.     Julian Hardwick, ABN Amro     The reason for Mr Brabeck's more positive view on raw materials for next year?     Roddy Child-Villiers     As you know our biggest food raw material is milk, that has remained stable at a high level  and I think that’s a fair comment, and other few raw materials we have seen grains and fats  are  down  a  bit.  So,  that’s  his  reason  I  guess.  He  will  talk  more  about  that  at  the  Press  Conference that follows this call.     Julian Hardwick, ABN Amro     Could I ask when the Executive Board looked at the larger projections for the balance of the  year,  what’s the  most recent profit numbers that they have seen. What period of profits for  the year, so far this year, have you actually had numbers for.     Roddy Child-Villiers     The zones make their margins on a monthly basis.     Julian Hardwick, ABN Amro     Have they had September numbers?     Roddy Child-Villiers     The zones will know their September margins, yes.     Questions on: 	Price increases in Europe & Sustainability of volume increases in next quarter     Mark Lynch, Goldman Sachs     Looking at the Europe performance I notice that pricing has gone up from 1.2% at the half  year to 2.2% at the Q3 stage, that’s quite a big increase. I think you talked about 10% price  increases in soluble coffee at the half year, have you put through any other price increases in  Europe at all?     Roddy Child-Villiers     Coffee is the main one.  There’s a little bit in Dairy perhaps but that’s really about it.  There is  a comp against this period of last year not against the first half of this year. But coffee would  be the main one.     Mark Lynch, Goldman Sachs     Going back to Sylvain’s point at the beginning, what surprised me from these numbers is that  you have managed to achieve both a good increase in price and a good increase in volume.  As you look into the fourth quarter I would have thought that your pricing momentum would  be sustained. Do you think you can continue to drive both to the same degree as you have  done in Q3, or do you think we are seeing any potential buy in ahead of price increases in  this quarter?     Roddy Child-Villiers     Coming back to your earlier question, there is also quite strong pricing in France across all  categories, France is obviously a big market. It is very difficult for us to answer your second  question, our guidance is that we will get to the 5 or 6% organic growth but to try and break  that down in one quarter between pricing and RIG is quite difficult. But clearly it is difficult to  see those trends changing much in the final quarter just because it is only one quarter in four  so the rate of the sales is already there.     Mark Lynch, Goldman Sachs     There is no evidence of any buy in?     Roddy Child-Villiers     No.     Questions on :	Water segments in Europe; Volume & Higher range products highlights     Alain Oberhuber, Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch     Can you give us a bit more highlights between the different segments, lets say the volume  products  and  also  the  champagne  products  as  you  mentioned  them,  San  Pellegrino  and  Perrier in Europe?     Roddy Child-Villiers     The outstanding performer in Europe has been San Pellegrino, that’s done very well amongst  the higher range products. It has done particularly well in the UK where it is up about 50%,  but also in some of the other markets.  Aquarel has continued to do well in Europe which is  our low price water which is effectively a price fighting water against the private label.  And  that’s doing very well, but its  weight is still relatively small  in our overall European sales.  I  think those are the two main winners that we have in terms of European performance.     Alain Oberhuber, Lombard Odier Darier Hentsch     To follow on France, could you give us some highlights of that region in water?     Roddy Child-Villiers     We report France and Belgium together, basically the organic growth was flat in France and Belgium.  In  France  it  was  Perrier,  Contrex  and  those  higher  priced  ones  that  were  more  penalized and as I say it was Aquarel that did very well.  And again San Pellegrino did very  well, even in France.     Question on:	Comments on effects in Q3 with reference to Q4 results     Thomas Schwarzenbach, Bank am Bellevue     Is there any special effect in Q3 that would have accelerated the growth rate at the expense  of Q4?     Roddy Child-Villiers     No.     Question on:	Food & Beverage Margins         John Cox, Kepler Equities     You  seem  to  be  saying  that  there’s  no  sign  of  any  slow  down  in  Q4  is  that  a  correct  assessment?     Roddy Child-Villiers     What we have said is that we will achieve our 5 -6% organic growth.         John Cox, Kepler Equities     Coming back to this whole margin issue. I know you are dancing around it a little bit. On the  constant currencies you talk about an improvement for the Group as a whole, can you say  that there  will be an improvement just for the Food & Beverage business for the year as a  whole.     Roddy Child-Villiers     This is only a sales call so I am afraid I cannot. We have never given a EBITA margin target  for the Foods & Beverage business.     John Cox, Kepler Equities      On coffee, you said you have some cover there, how far does that cover go out?     Roddy Child-Villiers     I haven’t got the latest data on that but it covers us into next year.     Question on: 	UK Performance comments     James Amoroso, Helvea      The UK performance in the press release was said to be continuing strong. I am assuming that was mainly Soluble Coffee as opposed to confectionary, would I be right in that?     Roddy Child-Villiers     Soluble  Coffee accelerated somewhat, confectionary  was a little bit slower. And something  else that is doing particularly well in the UK, even if it is rather smaller, is Coffee-mate which  we put a lot of activity behind and is up about 14%.     James Amoroso, Helvea     Is that the product that was delisted by Tesco?  I think it was a culinary product?     Roddy Child-Villiers     No Coffee-mate is a dairy product, it was as you say a culinary product.     Questions on: 	Increases in Ice Cream market share & Ice cream in Europe     John Parker, Deutsche Bank     Could you flesh out a little bit more your comments on ice cream. I think you said you were  market leader now in most of the countries in which you operated, can I read that to mean  that  you  overall  have gained  share  in  ice cream  and  if  you  have got  any  more  details  on  where you may have done that, that would be interesting. And specifically perhaps within ice  cream in Europe you talk about, it was down I think you said, I was expecting ice cream to be  a bit better this year because of the summer effect. Could you say whether that was a market  issue in Europe or  whether that  was a share issue.  I think  you did say  that  you had been  putting prices up generally in France. That strikes me as slightly against the trend of things at  the moment, did I hear you right and could you perhaps explain what’s happened there?     Roddy Child-Villiers     I  haven’t  actually  got  with me  the  individual  markets  where  we  were  the  market  leader,  although  I  think  there’s  a slide  on the web  site  in  a relatively  recent  presentation that lists  them. We have been getting some shares, obviously the big news in that sense is the US,  trials  were announced in early  November so I can’t talk  too  much about  that, but we have  gained share there.     In  Europe  I  think the  market  as a  whole  was expecting  ice  cream  to  be  better  rather  than  worse this quarter, but we didn’t have much of an August here in Europe and that does have an impact, even if there is an easy comparison from last year. It is interesting that we do have  some quite good performances in Europe and some less good performances in Europe and  our  SBU  head  puts  that  down  to  the  difference  between  excellent  in  execution  and  good  execution.  And the other thing to say about Europe is that we are much more excited about  the level of innovation in Europe for next year, than we had this year. As you know the US  this  year had a lot of innovation and  we expect that level of  innovation to be happening  in  Europe next year.     In France I don’t know whether it is against the trend in terms of the pricing increases but we  have certainly been able to take some towards the end of this year.  There is also, I think, last  year  we  had a  negative price  in  this  quarter  last  year.  So, there’s  probably  a comparative  effect, and  that  would have been because of  the Loi Galland.  It is important to remember  that the pricing is always a comparison against the previous year, the same quarter, rather  than against the same quarter of the same year.     Questions on:	Key drivers behind Q3 growth in Japan & Improvements in Russia     Warren Ackerman, Citigroup     At  the  half  year  stage  it  looks  as  though  Japan  was  down  1.5%  and  it  is  now  up  2.4%.      Obviously a nice improvement in Q3. Could you flesh out what the key drivers were behind  that?     Roddy Child-Villiers     I  guess those are  your  Q3  numbers  you  are talking.  Improvement  in  Japan  was primarily  driven by the strong growth in soluble coffee and as I said in my speech there are two things  that we have done, one is launching Excella Mild.  Excella is our biggest brand there, so this  is a mild variation of the biggest brand. And the second thing is launching a soft pouch. Soft  pouches as I expect you know are cheaper than glass jars because you can refill your glass  jar. So that’s been playing in terms of innovation and also through a lower price offering. That  being successful in turning soluble coffee business from negative RIG to positive RIG over  the last quarter and also our share is up 1%.     Also  performing  well  in  coffee  are  the  \"three-in-ones\"  and  the  specialty  coffees  like Cappuccino. \"Three-in-ones\" is  where  we sell it  with milk and sugar added. Chocolate has  also continued to do very well, it is continuing to deliver double digit RIG, Aero is also being  tremendously  successful  as well  as KitKat.  Important  for the rest  of the  year,  we are  just  coming into this peculiar Japanese season with the gift boxes, where people buy gift boxes of  coffee and give them to their relatives, and this is a key part for us, because it is also very  profitable. We have historically done very well in this sector and this is a key for us for the rest  of the year.     Warren Ackerman, Citigroup     Have you seen any  price pressure still coming through from the number two player in coffee  in Japan, Ajinomoto, I think that was a big issue at the beginning of the year.     Roddy Child-Villiers     Pricing has continued to be a challenge for us and actually you can see that the pricing has  got worse from the half year to the 9 months.     Warren Ackerman, Citigroup     Is it possible to give us a ball park number for what you think Japanese coffee price deflation  is running at year to date?     Roddy Child-Villiers     No. Because the pricing is impacted by several actions.  If  we do a promotion, for example  when we attach a small soft pack to a glass jar, this impacts pricing. Also there are different  things that are impacting the numbers. There is still pressure, that is why we have said at Half  Year that the Japanese margin will come off a bit.     Warren Ackerman, Citigroup     A question on Russia. We have been talking about it for the last 3 or 4 quarters and in the  press statement  it  sounds  like  you  are  more  confident  that  it  is  going to  get  better  in 06.  I  think  the  issues  we  have  been  through  before,  include  distribution.  In  terms  of  your  confidence level for that improving can you tell us why you are so much more confident than  you were earlier in the year?     Roddy Child-Villiers     I have tried to do that on the call.  All basics of the business are going better. But I think it is  important to remember that we had a change of management around April time. They took a  look at the issue in Russia and I think if I use a medical metaphor they chose to cut rather  deeper  perhaps  than  the previous  team  cut.  And,  you  know,  if  you  have  deep  surgery  it  takes longer to recover than if you don’t. So, it is taking a bit longer to recover, but equally  having gone deeper the recovery is more secure.  So, we are comfortable that, as I say, as of  next year we will start to see Russia returning to its traditional growth rates.     Warren Ackerman, Citigroup     Looking at the comp in Q4, the comp in Q4 with Russia looks very easy.     Roddy Child-Villiers     I am sure that pleases the market.     Questions on:	Hard discounters in Europe & Globe Update     Thomas Russo, Gardner Russo & Gardner     What update can you give us with your improvement with the work with the hard discounters,  possibly Lidl in Europe?     Roddy Child-Villiers     The big news in Europe this week was that Aldi have announced that they will consider the  idea  of  stocking  branded  goods.  We  have  continued  to  do  very  well  with  Lidl  we  have  expanded our coverage in terms of the markets in which we are present with them.  We will  at the full year give you an update on the growth of that particular channel. We said last year  it was growing at 10% and certainly this year it is growing at more than 10%.  And, we are  delighted by Aldi’s announcement and we will be doing our best to ensure that they are our  brands that are in there. So I think that’s a good news story for Europe at the moment, the  hard discounter channel.     Thomas Russo, Gardner Russo & Gardner     Update on Globe the perennial question on Globe?     Roddy Child-Villiers     Globe’s  going  fine,  we  are  likely  to  slightly  beat  our  30%  implementation  of  the  systems  target  for  the current  year by adding Brazil and Central Europe to  the  implementations, so  that’s also a good news story that’s going very well.     Closing words     Thank you for your questions and as I said before, Nestlé is on track to meet its forecast  for  the  year  made  back  in  February, of  achieving  organic  growth of  between  5  and  6%  combined with an improvement in constant currency margins.  Thank you.  "

Related on The Seeking Alpha Network:  CDW Earnings (CDWC Q3 2005 Conf Call) Prepared Remarks Question-and-Answer Session Q - Craig Scott:  Hi, good morning.  Barb, just a quick question on the margin assumptions of the 6.1 to 6.6.  As we work out. I got a little cut off there, but it sounds like the 6.6 you are looking for in the fourth quarter and then is it realistic to assume we dip down to the bottom of that range, in the first couple of quarters of calendar '06, or is that still a range where you hope to be toward the top end throughout the entire time period? A - Barbara Klein:  What I indicated was that we expect to be at the upper end of that objective range of 6.1 to 6.6% in the fourth quarter of this year, and also at the upper end of that range in the fourth quarter of 2006.  I also indicated we would probably be at the lower end of that range in the first quarter of 2006. Q - Craig Scott:  Thanks. I got cut out there a little bit.  And then as far as the tax rate goes, is there any opportunity to see a further decline in that?  And I guess how do you look at the visibility of that, given that we have seen a couple of positive cuts here to the tax rate over the last couple of quarters? A - Barbara Klein:  The major change in the tax rate from earlier this year was due to the fact that we began collecting sales tax from our customers in the second quarter.  And as a result, we become subject to state sales taxes in all of the states that have income taxes.  And so the change in our tax rate was primarily driven by that, the reason we had a modification in the third quarter was primarily due to higher levels of municipal bond investments that had pretty good returns. Under accounting guidelines we have to evaluate our tax rate every quarter, so there's possibility that it may change as we go forward into future quarters, but it's really going to be something we'll have to look at on a quarter-to-quarter basis. Q  -  Craig Scott:  Okay, thanks. Operator  Ben Reitzes - UBS Q - Ben Reitzes:  Yes, good morning.  I wanted to just ask with regard to the top line, what do you see?  Do you see these segments continuing to be the drivers of growth into '06 with regard to storage and desktop and servers and then again if you could clarify on notebooks, when do you think that the notebooks pick up again for you?  And then I have just a followup. A - Harry Harczak:  Ben this is Harry, and I'll take the second part of your question first. Notebooks, part of this, as we indicated, the revenue was a little soft, but our unit volume was very strong, so we actually think that's a positive sign.  We have had great response from some of our manufacturers in getting competitive pricing out at the front, makes us much more competitive.  When we look at our installed base we have got a lot of opportunity within our existing customer base where we're not penetrated in a notebook category. And then a couple of manufacturers have had some transitions as well. So we're going to focus our efforts and work closely with the manufacturers to try to drive -- continue to drive unit volume but to start to see the revenue volume increase. We are going to put some focus on that in the fourth quarter. In terms of segments that will continue to drive, I think you hit on some top ones. When we look at what customers are trying to do, things around server consolidation and storage continue to be critical. Security continues to be a driver, both from a software as well as a hardware side, and I think the upgrade cycle will continue both on the desktop side and the notebook side. I think we'll continue to see good unit volume there with a push towards mobility of many of our customers. Q - Ben Reitzes:  Just with regard to federal, you mentioned that I think things picked up a lot in September, could you just talk a little bit more about that vertical and sustainability you know as we -- as we go forward, and obviously it was year end so that's probably why things picked up, but would you talk about whether you think that's CDW specific or  -- and how that looks for you and your results maybe going forward? A - Jim Shanks:  This is Jim Shanks.  The federal space, as we had mentioned, the end of their fiscal year is September 30, so we always do see a strong push of activity, this year a little more than we had in the past even, which creates a very competitive environment.  The key to our success really came from our continued focus on funded opportunities.  We continue to get a lot of detailed experience in that space. We understand how the procurement is going to happen not only in the busy season but also in the off seasons.  So we feel that that was key to our success. We feel that it's something that we are going to continue to develop and build upon, as you can also see from some of the other details in the call today, we're continuing to find opportunities to invest in that space of future growth. Q - Ben Reitzes:  Thanks a lot. Operator  Brian Alexander with Raymond James Q - Brian Alexander:  Thank you.  Just a couple of questions, one on gross margin. Barb, you talked about product margin being up on a year over year basis. Just trying to get a sense for how much of that was due to product mix versus pricing.  And then following on to that, I think an offset to gross margin this quarter was on vender incentives, and as I recall this might be the third straight quarter where those have been down year-over-year. I know you don't have a ton of visibility in to that, but just based on your conversations with vendors, is there any reason for us to believe that that could be a trend, or is this an anomaly in the first few quarters of the year? A - Barbara Klein:  Brian, with respect to your question on margin, we don't really go into the detail behind the factors that I mentioned before. So we did see improvement in product pricing as we went into the third quarter compared to last year. We have seen that, I think, as we have gone through a couple of quarters of this year.  With respect to volume rebate, or vendor incentives and volume rebates, you're correct, we don't have a lot of visibility in to that because it really is driven by what our vendor partners decide to do in terms of the programs that they run. As we said before, our goal is to really make sure we know what the goals are, we understand what the programs are, and then we drive to make sure that we maximize our obtainabililty of those products -- of those goals each and every quarter. Q - Brian Alexander:  Can you just talk about how broad based those declines are in terms of vendor incentives? Is it coming from a few major vendors? Is it across the board? A - Barbara Klein:  Brian, one thing that you have probably seen in the press that effected us like a lot of others was the Microsoft changes that they made effective at the beginning their new fiscal year, which was in July. So that was one of the factors that impacted us in the third quarter. Q - Brian Alexander:  Okay. Great.  And then, I guess, the final question on -- on HP just a lot of commentary from them around perhaps investing in fewer partners, particularly those that are loyal to HP. Just trying to get a sense for, where do you think CDW fits into that commentary? Do you expect to be a net beneficiary of the changes that they are making around those vendor incentives? Q - John Edwardson:  Brian, John. Our sense from everything that we have heard both directly and indirectly is that HP is -- is going to be putting more eggs into fewer baskets, and what I mean by that, is they are going to be spending more of their money with the partners who generate the most profitable revenue for them.  Clearly as their No. 1 partner in the world we get a lot of visibility, and -- and we didn't get to be the No. 1 partner in the world without having a significant attached rate and without being very loyal to HP. But in any event, I am very comfortable with the direction they are heading. It's something that we think makes a lot of sense both for Hewlett-Packard, and for CDW as well. Q - Brian Alexander:  Final question for Harry just an update on solution edge. How many solution providers have you recruited, and just give us a sense for how that's going? A - Harry Harczak:  In solution end Brian, we have got in total about 30 partners at this point in time. We're still working on implementing the program with those partners in terms of converting customers and training their folks. There continues to be a high level of interest, we have had a couple of recent recruiting events with people and there continues to be a high level of interest. It is still not contributing any significant revenue but we are building the blocks and we think ultimate will be successful and we're going to continue to build and invest in it. Q - Brian Alexander:  Okay. Good luck to the other Chicago baseball team. A - Harry Harczak:  You mean the one that's in the World Series? Operator  Bernie Mahon - Morgan Stanley Q - Bernie Mahon:  Hi, good morning.   Question for you on the operating margins for 2006. In order to meet the, kind of, high end of that range, say 6.6, do you need to see a meaningful reacceleration in revenue or do you think the 10 to 11% year over year growth rate will get you to the 6.4 to 6.6 range? A - Barbara Klein:  Bernie, you know that we don't give any kind of guidance with respect to future revenue growth. We allow you all to make your estimates based on what we have given to you in terms of information, and just to reiterate my comment that I said earlier, our objective range is 6.1 to 6.6, and our goal is to be at the upper end of that range in the fourth quarter of 2006, but we'll probably be at the lower end of the range in the first quarter of 2006. Q - Bernie Mahon:  Thanks. Then, just a quick question on the federal government. So that was flat on a year over year basis in August. Harry, could you just talk how that played out in the month of September? Just the federal portion, not the entire public sector. A - Jim Shanks:  This is Jim Shanks. I'll take that question. On -- we did see in August that it was flat, and definitely saw a very strong pickup in September. Most of that heavily weighted towards the very back end of the month, so chasing a lot of the different funded opportunities that were out there, a lot of the activity we also saw came in our last 2 days of the month as well. Definitely strong pushup -- pickup on sales but we don't go into the exact percentages on year over year growth for that. Q - Bernie Mahon:  Right. So if you saw a strong pickup in the last week or so, is it safe to assume there's some big deals that maybe slipped into the December quarter? A - John Edwardson:  It is -- there are always deals that don't get shipped until the last week of September so that is a reasonably good assumption. Q - Bernie Mahon:  All right. Thanks a lot. Operator:  Thank you.  At this time we do have Matt Sheerin with Thomas Weisel Partners, please state your question. Q - Matt Sheerin:  Yes, thanks. John, I would like to ask the growth target question again.  I know you have backed off from specifically giving a target for growth market plus whatever, but obviously you're investing in -- in warehouse, you're investing in people so you -- you are obviously expecting to continue to grow revenue. You have been running in the 10 to 11% range year over year for the last 4 or 5 quarters, without giving a number, because I know -- I know that you won't, could you just talk about the opportunities, where you see opportunities for CDW, whether it be specific markets, specific geographic areas, where -- where do you expect to grow? A - John Edwardson:  A couple of different places, one -- and as the healthcare vertical, and as we look at that opportunity as a significant opportunity, and it was worth doing the reorganization that we went through. So as each of you are looking at your own healthcare costs at your own companies, you know that that market is huge. It is getting more expensive. Automation is ever more important, so that is clearly a focus. We continue to think that in the markets across the US we have somewhere around 5 to 6% market share, so we believe in every single segment that we have that we have profitable growth opportunities. We will be looking at more industry verticals, and more than likely, some time next year we'll do something similar to what we did with healthcare this year. We also believe that as we look at the organization of our -- of our sales groups, we need to align them better with our vendor partners, and so there are opportunities there to joint venture more with -- with our significant vendor partners, than we have done in the past, so those are significant. And Canada, which is not a very big operation, but -- but is growing, much more rapidly than the US market, and we're continuing to build resources in the Canadian market, so that will continue to be an opportunity for growth, and -- and I guess as we look at this, we clearly wouldn't be building or doubling the capacity of our distribution center and our configuration center, and if we didn't believe that we had substantial growth opportunities, and we're building ahead. Usually in the past, we have taken much smaller increments of investment when we built this particular facility, we built it as many of you know in three different pieces that was not a very efficient way to do it. So we have stepped up in this particular case and put most of the money into this facility in the beginning, so we built one building of a half million square feet instead of three buildings that we would continue to add on to. We have put much of the automation equipment into the building, and it will depress earnings a little bit as a result, and Barb has given those numbers to you.  But if we didn't feel very good about the future, believe me, we wouldn't be making those investments, and I guess that is the best way to answer your question. Q - Bernie Mahon:  Okay. And then just a follow-up. You talked earlier about the opportunities in building inventory and getting some buying power from vendors for big volumes, when -- or would we expect to see gross margin positively impacted by that? A - John Edwardson:  You know, those are -- are going to be very difficult to measure, and they happen generally at month end or quarter ends with different vendors or end of life on different product runs and we have begun to do a significant amount of business with many vendors at the end of -- of product life.  So -- and these have always been in our numbers, and we were not able to do as many of those, or if we did them, we had so much inventory in our facility that it was basically a log jam time.  So it will make operations a little more easier. We'll be able to look a little more for these.  But I don't know if -- you're not going to see a significant jump in gross margin as a result. Q - Bernie Mahon:  Okay. And just lastly, just quickly, on -- on healthcare, it's the growing part of your business, could you talk about seasonality in that business? A - John Edwardson:  We'll let Jim do that. A - Jim Shanks:  When you look at health care, we really aren't seeing any specific seasonality trend as we look at our data yet. Q - Bernie Mahon:  Okay. Thanks a lot. Operator:  Thank you. At this time we do have Bruce Simpson with William Blair. Please state your question. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Hi, I wonder if you can provide the breakout of how much of the 350 million run rate was classified from commercial and how much was from public sector, so that we can get more of an apples on apples comparison of CDW's growth? A - Barbara Klein:  Bruce this is Barb. We're not going to give you the details of the healthcare channel. We don't give details in general for any of the channels of our business. With the restatement you can get some information from looking at the information from 2004, 2005 on a restated basis, but as a general rule we don't give details for the channels of our business. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Okay. Let's hit the cost side of the income statement a little bit and talk about this incremental leased office expense. Is that downtown? Is that in the suburbs? Approximately what size in terms of square feet, or what capacity in terms of salespeople that you think you'll be able to house in there are built into that estimate that you gave us? A - John Edwardson:  Bruce, what we're doing is two different things here. In the city, as you may know, we have two different buildings in downtown Chicago that are adjacent to each other. We believe that it will be much more efficient and productive to have our people in a single building, so we are moving all of our people into one of those two buildings and we're -- we're also in this particular case committing to growth in the future, so we will be committing to take more in this building over the next several years, and -- and so there's going to be a little bit of transition expense and moving expense next year, and we have about 950 people or whereabouts in downtown Chicago right now. It is where most of our young people want to live and work when they join the Company. After they have been with the Company for a few years and they get married and have children, then the suburbs look more interesting, and many of them want to move, but at this point much of our growth in Chicago is going to be in downtown Chicago. Likewise, at our corporate offices, we are just completely out of space, and we are renting a space in a building directly across the street from this building. And -- and we'll be working on that building and hopefully moving into it in the next 3 or 4 months.  So lots of activity in the real estate group, and those expenses are included in the estimates that Barb has given you for year-over-year SG&A expense change. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Okay. Is the space that you are moving into up in the suburbs are you talking about incremental space for Vernon hills or the sales guys in Woodland Falls? A - John Edwardson:  That space is Vernon Hills, and we have -- as I mentioned in the sales organization, most of the new demand is going to be in downtown Chicago. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Okay. So you have got 950 down there now, when you make this commitment, how many will you be able to house down there? A - John Edwardson:  And everybody is saying more, and -- and Bruce, we -- you know, as you look at, this we're going to be growing that number steadily, and much, but not all of the growth will be in that building, but we have room to grow, in one of our New Jersey facilities. One of our New Jersey facilities is already completely filled up. Our Connecticut facility is completely filled. We have a little bit of room for our Alexandria -- not Alexandria outlet -- Herndon, Virginia facility, and but in many locations we have -- have simply maxed out those locations, and we need to provide more room for growth in each of them. Q - Bruce Simpson:  That was incremental expense that Barb mentioned inclusive of those other kinds of places that you are out of room, or are those going to be -- A- John Edwardson:  Yes. Q - Bruce Simpson:  That includes everything? A - John Edwardson:  Yes. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Okay. The Vernon Hills space that you are going rent it sounds like it is not sales space but it's rather operational. A - John Edwardson:  It is operational, yes. The corporate headquarters group, so it's going to be the finance group, and the purchasing group, and the IT group, and the marketing group, and legal, and -- and you know, and those kinds of functions. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Okay. And just to touch on a question that somebody asked earlier, given that there has historically been a relatively limited amount of leverage in this model, when you layer on these incremental expenses, what is the -- the investment thesis that you'll be able to get back into these kinds of 6.5 to 7.0 range by 2007? What's going to drive that kind of leverage once you have this incremental expense? A - John Edwardson:  Key theme is going to be simply revenue growth, and we need more of it, and that is one reason we're investing in the sales force as we mentioned. And -- but revenue growth is going to be it. And as -- as we look at the future, we still see lots of opportunities to grow in the US and the Canadian markets. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Last thing, John, any change at all on either your strategies on acquisition or on what you are seeing in terms of availability out there? A - John Edwardson:  No change, and no comments. Q - Bruce Simpson:  Okay. Thanks. A - John Edwardson:  Okay. Thank you, Bruce. Operator:  Thank you at this time we do have Steven Fortuna with Prudential Equity Group. Please state your question. Q - Steven Fortuna:  Great. Thanks. Just a couple of short ones here.  First would be on the productivity side. You guys haven't shown a lot of great year-over-year improvement. Maybe, Harry, you can talk a bit about some of the efforts you're making to try to drive that. And then second is, I know you guys are trying to drive more education mix, which is generally higher margin than government into the public business. How is that effort going along?  And then lastly, kind of a far flung question here, it it's pretty clear that Dell has been backing off on price aggression, particularly on consumer, but also I think to some degree on the corporate side. Have you seen anything, any benefit, as you go to customer that maybe Dell is kind of a little bit less aggressive and maybe that's helping your business a little bit? A - John Edwardson:  Okay. We'll answer your three part question in three parts and Harry will begin. Q - Harry Harczak:  In terms of productivity, we have seen some good results. Some of the things we're doing, Steve, that are helping that is the investment that we've made in our specialist teams. As you recall, specialists operate with the account managers on advanced technology solutions for customers, things like server consolidation, security specialist, mobile wireless. We have seen very good results from our efforts there which are helping to increase overall productivity. We have put in a number of tools that we're starting to see some results from. It's still early, but things such as our portfolio manager tool which gives an account manager the ability to see their entire account base and better understand where the opportunity is in their account base and develop a business plan for penetration, which is a significant opportunity for us. And then the last thing, I think, that has a positive impact this quarter in particular, is we are a little bit seasonal in the third quarter with the public sector and that certainly helps the productivity in the third quarter. So, those are -- there are a handful of other things, but if I had to key in a couple I would say those are some of the top ones. A - Jim Shanks:  As far as education, it is definitely one of our key channels. We're continuing our segmentation strategy in that space, allowing us to take and treat private and public higher education differently, K through 12 differently, and also a very extensive amount of work going on with targeting specific accounts in that space, making sure that we are identifying and meeting their unique needs. So as we continue to sharpen our segmentation and hone our skills at identifying those unique opportunities, we can continue to invest not only from a sales force standard point, both with inside and field, but also we can look at unique product offerings and also unique solution offerings that we can start to provide to those customers to continue to grow. A - John Edwardson:  Third, with respect to Dell, and I can't speak on much of the consumer business, but my sense is this, many of our -- or several of our major vendor partners, due to changes in their company, are getting their cost very much in line with Dell's. My sense is they are going to be holding Dell's feet to the fire on pricing. Dell -- which will be different than what it has been instead of Dell holding their feet to the fire. I'm seeing a big turn around in that area, and we have some very very competitive partners who are doing a darn good job at getting their costs in line, so that they can be great competitors with Dell. With that we have time for one more question, and -- and then what we will do is let those of you who wanted to ask questions have first chance to talk with Cindy directly at the end of the phone call, but we have about two more minutes before we need to move on to another meeting. Operator  Joel Wagonfeld - First Albany Q - Joel Wagonfeld:  Thanks very much. I was wondering if you could just comment on the 4% average unit selling price increase in desktops and servers. Was that a result of a mix shift port servers, or are you seeing actually positive ASP trends in both of those categories? Thanks. A - John Edwardson:  That is more of a shift in mix towards servers. Desktop average unit price was down just a tad. Offset by the shift in mix to servers and positive ASP gains in the server line. Q - Joel Wagonfeld:  Thanks. A - John Edwardson:  Okay. So with that we have phone calls left from David Manthey, Bill Fearnley, John Goyle, and Richard Gartner. Cindy will give you guys first opportunity as she takes phone calls.  Thank you very much, we are pleased to have another quarter record results. We know that you expect more in the future and -- and what you know we'll be working hard to make that happen.

John Edwardson,  CDW Corporation - Chairman, CEO As a result of the truly superb efforts of all of our CDW coworkers, we delivered another quarter of record performance in the third quarter of this year. We continue to profitably outpace market growth while setting new records for total revenue, average daily revenue, net income as well as diluted earnings per share. In addition, we had the best ever revenue week in the history of the company during the last week of September. My belief is that our consistent focus on the customer has been the key to this continuing track record of performance. Our 21-year culture is based upon giving customers a superior customer experience, and we continue to try to perfect this core company philosophy each and every day. Customers come to CDW for a full range of responsive service. This includes the knowledgeable advice of the industry's best-ranked sales group, industry's best products, and best solutions, next-day product delivery, as well as quick resolution to inquiries after the sale. Please turn to the third slide of the webcast presentation to take a look at our financial results. As you can see, total revenue was 1.67 billion in the third quarter of this year compared to 1.51 billion in the third quarter a year ago, an increase of 159 million or 10.5%.  We also had an increased average daily revenue of 10.5%, up to 26.1 million over the period a year ago. Also, annualized revenue per coworker was 1.62 million in the third quarter this year, compared to 1.61 million a year ago. Gross profit margin was 15.3%, operating profit margin 6.7%, as you can see. Net income was up 12.2% to 73.1 million and diluted earnings per share were up 15.8% to $0.88 a share.  For the month of September, we grew average daily revenue 12.5% at 28.2 million. Total revenue in the month was 593 million compared to total revenue in September a year ago, 527 million. Barb will give you many more details on the financial results in a few minutes. If you turn to overhead No. 4, you can see our return on equity, as well as our return on invested capital. In the third quarter of this year we achieved return on equity of 22.1%, which was 1.7 percentage points above the third quarter a year ago. Likewise, our OIC was up in the third quarter this year to 44.4%, compared to 44.1% in the third quarter a year ago.  These numbers, I believe, are outstanding numbers compared to any company in the industry in America. Consistent with previous quarters overall, IT demand remained relatively stable during the quarter. Activity from different customer channels, and that's different customer segments within CDW, can vary from month to month, but we did achieve growth in every customer channel for the entire quarter, including the federal government channel. In order to continue to take market share and achieve growth in the future over the long term, we need to make significant new investments to prepare for future growth. So we want to talk about some of those investments at this point. First, we continue to make significant investments in our sales organization, to develop our customer segmentation model.  Last quarter we announced the creation of a dedicated healthcare team, which will be part of our public sector group.  This initiative is part of the customer segmentation strategy for specific industry verticals.  During the third quarter, we successfully consolidated over 10,000 healthcare accounts from across our entire sales organization and transferred these accounts to the new team in the public sector group.  The transition was well executed and we are pleased with the results.  We believe that by leveraging our existing expertise in the healthcare industry, we will become increasingly well positioned to serve the unique IT needs of our healthcare customers and take market share in this growing vertical. As you already know, we are also making significant investments in our infrastructure to position the company for more growth.  Our biggest new investment course is the new North Las Vegas distribution center, which is also on track to open by the end of this year.  We believe that this new world-class facility will set industry standards in terms of productivity as well as efficiency.  While the project was initiated out of necessity, since our Vernon Hills facility is operating at capacity, we believe there are a number of new advantages we will gain as a result of opening this new facility. First as an ideal location, not because it was just in Las Vegas, but because Las Vegas is 1 day away or less from many of our vendor, distributor, and carrier partner facilities, as well as less than a 1 day trip from the important port in Long Beach where most of our inbound product shipments come into the country. We will also be closer to our largest customer base. Usually our number 1 revenue state is the state of California. Second, the extra space available in the new distribution center will enhance our purchasing power. We are out of room in this facility, and as a result are not able to take advantage of large product buy-ins when they are available. We've had to restrict our ability to do those, or operate in very tight facilities at Vernon Hills.  So this will be a new advantage as well.  In addition, our configuration center in Vernon Hills, which all of you know about and which was doubled over the past 18 months, is also at capacity, and we are building an even bigger configuration center in the new Las Vegas facility. And fourth, we do expect to get shipping efficiencies by leveraging both locations as we are choosing which location to ship from to our customers.  So we know that we'll have good enhancements, better customer service as a result of this significant new investment, but it is significant.  So investments in our infrastructure and in our organization will add to our expenses in the short-term and Barb will go over those with you in a little more detail in her presentation. We do need to move forward with these initiatives since they are necessary to provide the room for future growth, but we want you to know that our philosophy of never being satisfied is as strong as ever, and it is just as applicable to earnings per share as it is to customer service, so we will work hard to leverage these additional expenses as quickly as possible. We believe firmly that our approach to customer segmentation will continue to pay off and we will continue to execute our key strategies for growth, which are enumerated on overhead No. 5 of the webcast presentation. They include improving productivity, growing our customer base, penetrating existing accounts, optimizing our product mix, strengthening our brand, and selectively pursuing strategic transactions. Finally, I want to give a big thank you to each of our CDW coworkers who delivered another record quarter by doing a great job for our customers. With that, I would like to turn the presentation over to Harry Harczak who is stepping up to the plate to give you his near term outlook, which is White Sox Win the World Series.  I will now turn the call over to Harry to discuss baseball, philosophy, sales and product trends for the third quarter. Harry Harczak,  CDW Corporation - EVP, Sales Thank you, John, and from a baseball perspective what an exciting time it has been in Chicago.  Now on to business, both the corporate and public sector segments achieved new quarterly sales records in the third quarter of 2005, and all customer channels grew compared to the same period a year ago.  These results reflect a restatement for the consolidation and transfer of all healthcare accounts to the public sector, which is attached as an addendum to our third quarter of 2005 earnings press release. In the corporate sector, total corporate segment sales were 1.117 billion in the third quarter of 2005, compared to 1.018 billion in the third quarter of 2004, representing a 9.7% growth over the prior year.  Average daily sales in the third quarter of 2005 were 17.4 million, compared to 15.9 million in the third quarter of 2004.  Both quarters had 64 billing days. We experienced normal seasonal patterns in the corporate segment during the third quarter.  Corporate sector growth, which outpaced the market, resulted from the continued execution of our key growth strategies that John outlined in his section, such as penetration of existing accounts and new customer acquisition.  We believe our performance was positively impacted by our continuing investment in our specialist teams and on going training for the entire sales force. Our public sector segment, CDW-G, generated total sales of $554 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to 494 million in the third quarter of 2004, representing a 12.2% increase. Average daily sales were 8.6 million in the third quarter of 2005, compared to 7.7 million in the third quarter of 2004.  In our August monthly sales announcements, we indicated that federal sales were flat for the month.  Federal sales grew in the third quarter of 2005, compared to the period a year ago, due in large part to our focus on funded opportunities within the federal customer channel.  The third quarter has historically represented our strongest quarter due to the federal government's fiscal year end on September 30th.  As we examine the potential impact of hurricane Katrina on the third quarter 2005 results, net net we found the impact was minimal for both the corporate and public sectors. On September 30, 2005, our sales work force numbered 2061, which was 9.6% higher, versus 1,880 on September 30th of 2004.  We are on track to add 100 to 125 net new sales force coworkers in 2005, which includes, account managers, specialists and field sales coworkers. We have also continued to increase the number of our advanced technology specialists, which now number approximately 260.  Sales force retention continued to improve versus last year. In the third quarter of 2005, the percentage of sales force turnover was in the high teens, while a year ago it was in the high 20's. On slide 6, average daily sales per average sales force coworker was approximately $13,000 for the third quarter of 2005, which translates to approximately $3.3 million on an annualized run rate basis.  On a year-over-year basis, we maintained our productivity levels and on a sequential basis we increased average daily sale per average sales force coworker by 6.6%.  This metric is affected by both the timing of new hires and sales cyclicality.  As we continue to grow the sales force, we remain focused on improving productivity across the entire sales organization. I'll now turn to highlights of product trends.  Slide 7 shows our product mix for the third quarter of 2005, compared to the third quarter of 2004.  Software remained our largest product category comprising 17.3% of sales.  Data storage devices was second at 13.9%. Desktop computers and servers were third at 13.7%.  Notebooks and accessories was our fourth largest category 12.9% and printers were 5th at 12.2%.  Product revenue growth rates are shown on slide 8. Data storage devices increased 17.8% versus the prior year period, and desktops and servers grew 16.6%. The trend of server consolidation positively impacted both these product categories. In addition, demand for storage was driven by the ever increasing amounts of data to be stored, threats of data loss, and increasing government legislation surrounding maintenance, access, and security of stored data.  Growth in servers was positively impacted by increased sales of higher ASP technologies such as blade servers and dual core processors.  Strong desktop growth resulted from our PC refresh campaign that focuses on the productivity gains of upgrading old desktops. Netcom products grew 15.7%, and the category was positively impacted by demand for security products, routers and switches, power and telephony.  Software grew 14.8%. Application suites, operating systems, and security software were standout drivers of this category.  Printers increased 6%, with solid growth in faster color laser printers, multifunction printers, and printer supplies.  The video category had double digit unit volume growth, but total revenue was impacted by declining ASPs, especially for LCD, displays, and projectors.  The notebook and accessory category decreased slightly by 0.2%. Notebook CPU growth of 2.2% was partially offset by lower sales of hand helds and PDA's which are included in the notebook and accessory category.  Slide 9 shows the change in revenue, unit volume, average selling prices for notebook CPUs and desktops and server CPUs.  Notebook CPU revenue increased 2.2% and unit volume was up 11.8% compared to the third quarter of 2004, with the average selling price declining 8.6% from a year ago.  Notebook sales were impacted by product mix.  ASPs on some notebook lines were significantly lower but these prices allowed us to be more competitive in the marketplace, driving unit volume.  In addition, Apple was focused in taking more business to direct sales channels. In the fourth quarter of 2005, marketing efforts will be focused on a notebook refresh campaign that promotes the productivity benefits of updating older notebooks. We also expect to expand our notebook category offerings, and will continue to concentrate on further penetrating this category with our existing customer base.  Revenue from desktop computers and servers increased 16.6%, and unit volume was up 12% from the third quarter of 2004, with the average selling price increasing 4.2%. Slide 10 shows that the web generated approximately $455 million in direct online sales for the third quarter, representing 27.3% of sales in the third quarter, an increase of 12.3% over the third quarter of 2004.  We want to drive more customer web usage so we'll continue to enhance the functionality of both our website and customer extranets. Barb Klein will now comment on third quarter financial performance. Barbara Klein,  CDW Corporation - CFO, SVP Thank you Harry, and good morning again.  As John mentioned, the third quarter of 2005 was another quarter of record, in which we outpaced market growth and delivered solid financial performance. Gross profit margin in the third quarter of 2005 was 15.3% compared to 15.1% in the third quarter of 2004, and within our stated objective range of 14.75% to 15.5%.  The increase was primarily due to stronger product margins. Additionally, a larger amount of cooperative advertising funds were reclassified as a reduction of cost of sales, due to both an increase in marketing activities and because virtually all cooperative advertising funds were reclassified as a reduction of cost of sales in 2005. The positive impact from these items was partially offset by reduced customer charges for delivery, insurance and handling, and a lower level of vendor incentives. The company restructured and simplified its charges to customers for delivery and insurance and handling in the first quarter of 2005.  We expected these modifications to be offset by changes in product pricing and expedited delivery charges over the course of the year and we have made progress on this objective. Vendor incentives were lower in the third quarter of 2005 versus 2004 due to changes in vendor program.  Advertising expense was $29.8 million in the third quarter of 2005, and $24 million in the third quarter of 2004, an increase of approximately 24%, we continue to execute the integrated branding campaign that was launched earlier in the year. Slide 11 shows our operating statistics.  As CDW's business continues to evolve, we periodically evaluate the relevance of metrics used to measure our performance.  As we have discussed before, CDW's business has become less homogeneous over the years. The metrics for invoice size and number of invoices have become less meaningful as the business has changed.  For example, an invoice could contain a single item such as a printer, or it could represent a multimillion-dollar billing to a customer.  Additionally, a single order could be fulfilled through multiple shipments and invoices.  Since invoice size and number of invoices are no longer as relevant as measures of our operations, this is the final quarter we will provide these metrics. Selling and administrative expenses were 6.8 % of sales in the third quarter of 2005, compared to 6.5% in the third quarter of 2004, an increased 15.1% compared to previous year.  The increase was due to increased expense for the additional profit sharing contributions to the 401K plan of $1,000 per coworker announced earlier this year in conjunction with the modification to the company's stock option program. Approximately $1 million of expenses relating to the preparation for start up of the company's new distribution center in North Las Vegas Nevada and increased payroll cost for a larger number of coworkers to support a larger and growing business. Our operating margin was 6.7% in the third quarter 2005, compared to 7% in the third quarter of 2004, and was within our stated objective of 6.5% to 7%.  Inventory turns on an annualized basis were 25 times in the third quarter of 2005, compared to 24 times in the previous year.  Our objective remains at 25 inventory turns annually. Accounts receivable days sales outstanding were 37 days at the end of the third quarter 2005, compared to 33 days at the end of the third quarter of 2004.  The increase in day sales outstanding was due to a higher percentage of sales on terms as our commercial customers continue to represent a larger portion of our sales.  As a note, over 99% of our customers are commercial customers for the third quarter of 2005.  The increase in September 2005 revenue of 12.5% compared to the prior year, and the inclusion of sales taxes collected from our commercial customers in accounts receivable, which permanently added approximately 2 days to days sales outstanding beginning in the second quarter of 2005.  Our DSO target is 35 to 37 days. The effective tax rate for the third quarter of 2005 was 36.9%, compared to 39.6% for the third quarter of 2004.  The tax rate of 36.9% for the third quarter of 2005 reflects an adjustment to the overall effective tax rate, to arrive at combined rate of 37.4% for the first nine months of 2005, which is the rate we currently expect for full year 2005. The primary reason for the year-over-year decrease is the result of collecting state sales taxes, which began in the second quarter 2005.  CDW had to register to do business in all states in order to collect sales taxes, which makes the company subject to state income taxes.   Income tax rates and apportionment factors vary across state. The revised effective tax rate is estimated at 37.4% for full year 2005, which is slightly down from the estimate of 37.8% we provided in the second quarter of 2005.  The difference is due to an increase in estimated tax-exempt interest income from state and municipal securities that will be earned in 2005.  Change in effective tax rate increased earnings per share in the third quarter of 2005 compared to third quarter of 2004 by approximately $0.04 per share. On a sequential quarter basis, the effective tax rate that we provided in the second quarter for the remainder of full year 2005, compared to the actual tax rate for the third quarter 2005 increased earnings per share in the third quarter by approximately a penny per share. We repurchased 124,000 shares of our stock in the third quarter at a total cost of $7 million. Year to date we have spent $219 million for share repurchases, at an average price of $56.76. In the second quarter of 2005, share repurchases of approximately 1.5 million shares were more heavily weighted towards the end of the quarter. The full impact of those repurchases was realized in the diluted weighted average number of common shares outstanding in third quarter of 2005.  On a sequential quarter basis this positively impacted earnings per share for the quarter by approximately a penny per share.  We have approximately 2.9 million shares remaining under the current share repurchase authorization, which expires in April 2007.  Slide 12 shows our share repurchase and dividend history. And in total, we have returned over a quarter of a billion dollars to shareholders in 2005. We ended the third quarter with approximately $590 million in cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities.  Cash flow from operations was approximately $67 million in the third quarter of 2005 and $238 million in the first nine months of 2005.  Working capital increased in the third quarter of 2005 as the business continued to grow, which we also saw in last year's third quarter. As John discussed, we have fully transitioned our healthcare accounts to creating new customer channels within the public sector.  Results of operations on a quarterly basis for 2004 and the first two quarters of 2005 have been restated for the corporate and public sector segments to reflect this change.  The addendum to the financial information in our press release provides these restatements. As a result of the transition, corporate sector operating margins did not change significantly, however, the public sector operating margins were generally positively impacted because the margin on sales to health care customers was more similar to an average corporate sector customer than an average public sector customer.  In the third quarter 2005, corporate sector sales increased 9.7% and operating income increased 8.9%.  Public sector sales increased 12.2% in the third quarter, compared to last year's third quarter, while operating income increased 3%. Operating income for the public sector increased at a more modest rate due to lower gross margin on certain government customer sales and an increase in selling payroll, primarily for field sales coworkers to support the increase in sales.  Headquarters and other expenses increased from $6.7 million in the third quarter of 2004 to $8.6 million in the third quarter of 2005, primarily due to larger number of coworkers to support a larger and growing business and increased depreciation expense related to software investments made in the second half of 2004 and hardware investments made in 2005. John also talked about our second distribution center in North Las Vegas Nevada, which is scheduled to open by the end of 2005.  Since we are at capacity in our existing distribution center in the Chicago area, we are investing in this new facility to prepare for future growth.  The Las Vegas distribution center will be approximately 500,000 square feet compared to our current distribution center of 450,000 square feet. Over the next few years we will leverage the new space and balance shipments and growth between the two facilities. To ensure that everything is working smoothly, the operations in the new distribution center will be ramped in a controlled and deliberate manner.  During the initial stages, we will begin to ship to those customers in the western most states, such as California and Nevada. Gradually, we'll begin to serve those customers located west of the Mississippi river out of the new facility. We estimate capital expenditures of 35 to $40 million for the facility in 2005.  By the end of 2006 we anticipate utilizing 30 to 40% of the facility's capacity.  As John indicated, the Las Vegas distribution center is an investment to support future growth.  As we have stated previously, the project will increase SG&A expenses.  In the third quarter of 2005 we incurred approximately $1 million as start-up cost and in the fourth quarter of 2005, we expect approximately 3 to $4 million of start-up costs. The total expected start-up costs for 2005 of approximately 4 to $5 million is down slightly from our previous estimate of 5 to $6 million. In 2006, there will be added expenses including rent, depreciation, coworker costs, facilities and supplies.  Some of these costs like rent and depreciation are straight lined for accounting purposes and are not tied to shipping volume.   In addition to the new distribution center, we will be adding leased office space primarily in the Chicago area for sales and support functions.  As we continue to grow, we will need more space to accommodate more coworkers.  Rent and depreciation are straight lined for accounting purposes, regardless of the fact that the additional costs provide for future growth. The new distribution center and additional office space represent infrastructure investments that are necessary to support CDW's future growth.  However, these investments will impact SG&A expenses and operating margin in both the fourth quarter of 2005 and full year 2006.  Total SG&A expense for these investments is estimated at approximately $25 million in 2006, and approximately $17 million incrementally over 2005. Primarily as a result of these investments, our operating margin objective is modified to a range of 6.1 to 6.6% for these periods.  At this time, our goal is to be at the higher end of this range in the fourth quarter of 2005 and the fourth quarter of 2006, but we'll probably be at the lower end of this range in the first quarter of 2006.  As we have typically done in the past, we'll continue to provide our operating margin range objective on a quarterly basis during our quarterly earnings conference call.  Also as we have done historically we will not update this objective during any quarter. As John indicated, we will focus on leveraging the additional expenses from these infrastructure investments.  Our goal is to work our way back as quickly as possible to our previously stated operating margin range objective of 6.5 to 7% in 2007.  We will do this through additional customer segmentation, and the execution of our growth strategies, which, again are, to improve productivity, expand our customer base, penetrate existing accounts, optimize our product mix, strengthen our national brand and selectively pursue strategic transactions. We've been able to consistently take market share and achieve profitable growth in all economic environments, and these objectives remain firmly in place.  Thank you for your attention and we will now open the line for questions. Continue on to the Q & A.

"5714","CIT","Q3","2005","    CIT    October 19, 2005    10:00 am CT    Operator: 	  Good morning. My name is (Jenny) and I will be your conference operator today. At this time I would like to welcome everyone to CIT Third Quarter  Earnings conference call. All lines have been placed on mute to prevent any  background noise.     After the speaker’s remarks, there will  be a question and answer period. If you  would like to ask a question during this time, simply press star and the number  1 on your telephone keypad. If you would like to withdraw your question,  press star 2.     I will now turn the conference over to Ms. Valerie Gerard, Executive Vice  President of Investor Relations.   Please go ahead ma’am.    Valerie Gerard:    Thanks (Jenny) and good morning everyone. Welcome. We’re delighted that you’re here with us today for a review of our third quarter results. After formal remarks by Jeff Peek, Chairman and CEO and Joe Leone Vice  Chairman and Chief Financial Officer, we will move into Q&A.     Now as you know, elements of this ca ll are forward-looking in nature and  relate only to the time and date of this call. We expressly disclaim any duty to  update these statements based on new information, future events or otherwise.    For information about risk factors relati ng to the business, please refer to our  SEC report. Any references to certain non-GAAP financial measures are  meant to provide meaningful insight and are reconciled with GAAP in our  Investor Relations Section of our Web site which is located at www.cit.com.    With that, it’s my pleasure to introduce Jeff Peek.    Jeffrey Peek:    Thank you Valerie and good morning everyone. As you have seen from today’s announcements, our earnings, we delivered another outstanding  quarter in which CIT demonstrated its agility in meeting both its immediate  and long term objectives.    This balance allowed us to produce solid  quarterly results while also working  on a variety of growth initiatives.    Our diluted earnings per share incr eased 23% to $1.06 over the third of 2004.  We exceeded our target return on tangible equity of 16% with a number of  17% for the quarter and 16.2% for the first nine months of 2005. Importantly, origination volume increas ed 34% to $8 billion from the third  quarter of last year.    Total managed assets were at 61.3 bil lion -- up 17% compared to last year.  And asset growth was broad based this quarter and the new business pipeline  remains solid.    Now here are the business highlights for  the quarter from my perspective. We  saw important momentum in all of our sales initiatives which I talked about  last quarter. We are making significant progress getting our sales organization  mobilized and seeing very strong trends in new business.     We also created a well resourced o ffice of sales and marketing at the CIT  corporate level as well as chief sales officers in each of our business units.  And we recruited an additional 133 salespeople during the quarter.     We commenced the rollout of salesforce.com in September with an estimated  completion date of November 1.   As a result, virtually all of our sales  managers are now trained in using these tools and forecasting capabilities to manage our client relationships giving us more detail on sales calls,  conversion ratios and productivity.    We continue to expand and establish  relationships with companies such as  Amazon.com, NEC Europe, Toshiba, Northrup Grumman, Arby’s and Under Armor all of which added to our business in the third quarter.    Now during the quarter, we made furt her use of our risk adjusted capital  model to improve the composition of our portfolio. We continue to look for  ways to sell under-performing businesses and reinvest the capital in other  areas with stronger growth opportunities. This redeployment of capital allows  us to achieve better long term returns for our shareholders.     For example, in September, we initiate d a program to sell a number of vintage  out of production aircraft as part of our strategy to maintain a modern fleet of  airplanes capable of contributing positively to our risk-adjusted returns.     As the same time, we also announced  plans to accelerate the liquidation of  approximately $125 million in manufactured housing receivables.    And finally, after prolon ged negotiation, we took advantage of the strong  commercial real estate market by selling our interest in Waterside Plaza, a  residential complex in New York City.    Now the net effect of these actions will be positive in terms of enhancing  ongoing returns and the overall quality of our portfolio.     The third quarter also saw us open a  new chapter in CIT’s long history of  financing commercial aircraft.   Having stipulated the new investment in the  sector would require improved return, we were pleased to see demand from  international aerospace clients strengthen and the rental rates rebound. As a  result, we are increasing our investment in this portfolio to take advantage of  these opportunities.    In August, we signed a purchase agr eement with aircraft manufacturer,  Airbus. The new order covers 24 A320 aircraft to be delivered in 2007 and  2008 and five of Airbus’s new midsized aircraft, the A350 to be delivered in  2012 and 2013. We also have options to acquire additional airplanes as part of  this order.     We anticipate that when leased, these  new planes will exceed targeted returns  and will help us capitalize on our established market position as a leader in  commercial aviation finance. We expect the demand for commercial aircraft to continue to improve along with the outlook in the international aerospace  sector.     We were also able to deliver on better capital discipline, improve balance  sheet management and increase shareholder returns. Our commitment to  improved returns produced an enhanced return on tangible equity of 17% and  internal capital generation of nearly 15%. Consequently, we were able to  follow-up our 23% dividend increase in quarter two with a $500 million  accelerated stock repurchase program which returned incremental capital to  our shareholders.    Now let me also provide some updates on several acquisitions which will  become growth engines in our portfolio. The acquisition of healthcare  business credit corporation was quickly and efficiently completed on August  31st and the integration of these operations has exceeded expectations.    HBCC is a full-service healthcare financ ing company that specializes in asset- based and cash flow financing in North America. And this acquisition  accelerated our plan build out providing efficient cost-effective core platform  to support the strong growth we see in this sector. We now have 65 new  professionals on CIT’s healthcare team which currently totals 140 members.    We also continue to make solid progress with Student Loan Express. SLX  improved quarterly results and it’s accretive to earnings ahead of expectation.     And in the third quarter, total origina tions were $945 million with the school  channel contributing 253 million -- a 49% increase from last year.     During the quarter, we also ac quired over 16,000 new rail cars in a  combination of discreet portfolio purchases and our normal deliveries solidifying our position with 81,000 rail cars as the youngest fleet in the  industry. Operating at full economic utilization, we are benefiting from the  strong demand to transport goods over the nation’s railway system due to the  China effect as well as higher gasoline prices.    Now I believe that CIT is off to a str ong start in the fourth quarter and we’re  definitely on target to achieve our financial goals for 2005.     We reiterate our guidance of operating earnings per share growing in excess  of 20% from 2004 levels and return on tangible equity exceeding 16% for the  entire year of 2005.     The economic trends and business en vironment underlying our operations are  favorable with a noticeable pickup in the month of October.     Although we are working hard to reduce co sts in certain sectors to provide the  necessary capital, our operating efficiency did not improve this quarter. While  Joe will discuss the primary components of operating expense, let me just say  that we are very focused on the need to reduce cost and increase productivity  so that we can invest in some of our growth engines. We will eliminate  additional expenses and streamline our infrastructure.    In closing, CIT had a strong quarter  and we remain confident about the  execution of our strategy. We made significant progress on many of our  business initiatives. I still see numerous opportunities to grow assets, improve  efficiency and enhance shareholder returns.    Now we will be providing additional  insights into our business operations and  information about our 2006 plan at CIT Investor Day on November 8 in New  York City. And we look forward to seeing you all there.    I will now turn it over to Joe, our Vice Chairman and Chief Financial Officer  for a discussion of our financial results. Joe?    Joseph Leone:    Thanks Jeff. Good morning everyone. Let me start by giving you some more color on some of the highlighted or noteworthy items in the quarter. We sold  our interest as Jeff said, in the residential real estate investment in New York  City. We have been analyzing the sale of this property for quite some time and  formerly commence the process in the summer given the strength in the real  estate market.     We held the property for over 30 years so  we were carrying at a very nominal  book value. We also took other capital management actions that Jeff  mentioned to better position the company to deliver stronger returns.   Let me  give you more detail. We initiated the program and now intend to sell about  50 out of production aircraft with a book value of about 190 million. The  planes average 19 years, are less fuel efficient than our core fleet.     It’s a mix of commercial, regional an d sub-business aircraft. And most are  manufactured by manufacturers that no longer make planes. Some of the  model types are (Donye) and Saabs and then we also had some MD 80s and  DC 10s.    Following these sales, we will have only two aircraft from - of these type in  our fleet, both of which are with bankrupt carrier and our reserve (floor). The  marketing process for these planes will extend into 2006.     Jeff mentioned we accelerated the liqu idation of certain manufactured housing  receivables and we wrote these receivables down to the estimated sales  proceeds. With respect to Hurricane exposure, we set aside a $35 million reserve for losses and wrote down securitization retained interest by $7  million. This reflects our judgments, our best estimates of future losses that  will result from these catastrophes and are based on the information we have  currently available.    Our gross exposure across  all our businesses in the FEMA affected zones and  other impacted areas is roughly $600 million including securitization. Our loss estimate related principally to 300 million of those receivables smaller ticket  in home mortgages, vendor and equipment finance and factoring.     In total, the loss estimate we put up was over $42 million. Additionally, we  released an international tax reserve liability we had previously established as  we have received a clearing opinion from local authorities.     The EPS impact of the noteworthy items are as follows. Gain on real estate  sale, about 34% positive. Release of tax reserves, about 8 cents positive. Write  down of manufactured housing and air assets, negative by about 31 cents. And  charges related to hurricanes to set aside of loss reserves and the retained  interest, about 13 cents negative.    My comments from this point forward will give you - will be based on the  numbers excluding these items to give you a better view of operating  performance trends. We had a very strong quarter. Asset growth was very  broad based. Margins improved. Revenues were up 10% from a year ago with  good topline growth. Credit losses were low and we had solid non-spread  revenue, almost 40% of our revenues with low securitization (gates). Overall,  very high earnings quality.     Asset growth, as Jeff said, volume was  up nicely from the prior year with  higher volumes in all segments except equipment finance which we are reorganizing. Deal flow is strong in global vendor, communications and  media, energy and our Canadian consumer businesses.     We had over $3 billion of managed asset  growth broad based. Factoring assets  grew $1 billion. It’s a seasonally strong quarter as retailers build up  inventories ahead of the holiday season.    Consumer assets grew 800 million, 500 in home lending, 300 million in  student lending. More on those businesses later.    Healthcare assets, very important in itiative, grew 600 million including the  acquisition Jeff described. And the new business pipeline there is very strong.  Trains and planes grew 300 million, principally rail where we increased the  size of our fleet, plus some regional air growth.     Specialty finance commercial grew  200 million reflecting strong vendor  finance volume both in the US and abroad. Actual year to date US Dell  volume is up. And internationally Dell volume is up very nicely year over  year. Vendor volumes excluding Dell were also up from last year.    While we continue to see pricing pres sures in the market due to strong and  liquid markets, our net finance margin increased five basis points. That was a  real positive in light of the increasing short-term rates and the flat yield curve.  I think that reflects the product mix changes we've been making, a disciplined  pricing strategy and our capital allocation strategy, not to mention a very  effective funding program that serves us well in all parts of the cycle.    Non-spread revenue as I said before  was very strong. And that provides some  diversification away from the interest rate cycle.     Credit -- charge offs were lower than  I expected, 46 basis points down from  over - about 52 last quarter. And this is the first time we've been under 50  since the late '90s. We had very low loss levels in all commercial finance  segments and overall recovery continued rather strong.    On the US airline our gross exposur e to Delta is about $100 million and $57  to Northwest. At this time we have reserves allocated to US hub carriers and  we feel that the amounts of the reserves are adequate given our exposures and  our estimate of collateral values.    Non-performers -- they were up solely because of placing about $85 million  of the receivables from Delta and Northwest on non-accrual. Some of the  receivables to Delta and Northwest have equipment values in excess of  amounts due so we did not put about $40 million or so of those receivables on  non-accrual. If you take out airline non-performance our non-performing  loans actually declined.    Delinquencies were not impacted by the bankr uptcies of these airlines as of at  quarter end they were contractually current. We did see a sequential increase  in specialty finance, some due to seasonality and some due to season.  Consumer delinquencies excluding the acquisition of Student Lending were  actually down from last year.    Loss reserves increased to $653 milli on principally due to the hurricane  provision. Twenty-eight million of the $35 million of the hurricane reserve ran  through the provision and $7 million was a reallocation of existing reserves.  When I look at the reserves in total of 153 basis points, that includes our  hurricane loss estimates, our US sub-carry exposures and we feel are very  strong given the portfolio mix and the credit performance we've had.    Expenses -- Jeff gave you some overview. Expenses increased $9 million  sequentially. That includes about $2 million in additional restructuring cost  we set up this quarter. So the net remaining increase was about $7 million.     Where did it come from? About $5 m illion was for increased incentive based  compensation accruals, reflecting our strong income growth, good volume and  return on equity performance. Those are the metrics we measure management  on. Sales and marketing expenses increased about $5 million, $2 million of  which reflects the build out of healthcare including the acquisition.     Offsetting these increases was a bout $5 million of savings from our  restructuring. Headcount was up about 55. We closed the healthcare  acquisition and added sales personnel but we continued to streamline back  office operations.     Taxes -- our operating effective tax rate  - our effective tax rate on operating  results was about 34.6% and that's down from 39% last year and that reflects  the international aerospace initiative and improved profitability overseas,  particularly in global vendor finance. We expect our Q4 fourth quarter  effective tax rate to be in the 35% area and that's in line with our overall year  expectations.    Update on our stock buy back program.  As of September 30 we have received  slightly over 10 million shares and we could receive an additional million  shares plus depending on the stock price performance in the fourth quarter.  For EPS calculations, our average share count declined almost 7 million  shares this quarter. I anticipate another 3 million plus reduction in average  share count in Q4.    We issued the preferred. Jeff mentioned  it. We talked about it on the last call.  It's about our thoughts. We had a $500 million issuance of non-cumulative  preferred - perpetual preferred. Three fifty was fixed at a rate a little over 6%  and 150 is fixed for five years and floating thereafter. Both traunches are  perpetually with par full options after five years. I think that's excellent  pricing.     And the net impact of these capital tr ansactions was replacing common stock  with the cost of capital in the area of 12% to 15% with high equity preferred at  a cost of 6%. This resulted in accretion in the quarter in EPS and a 1%  improvement in ROI.    Jeff mentioned internal capital genera tion remains strong and our capital ratio  at 9.4% is in excess of the 9% our bottoms up analysis yields. So we continue  to have available capital to support growth from strong earnings and a strong  balance sheet.    Let me comment on some businesses th at you frequently ask me questions on.  First let's talk about aerospace. That's included in capital finance.     Capital finance which has both planes  and trains had an ROE over 12% this  quarter with rail exceeding our target. Returns on the commercial aerospace  fleet, while still below target, were up significantly from a year ago. Lease  rates are up. Our tax structure is improved. And returns that we expect on new  airplanes deliveries exceed 15%. All of our remaining 2005 deliveries and half  of our scheduled 2006 deliveries are placed. We only had two aircraft on the  ground and one had a letter of intent.    Equipment finance -- equipment finance re turn on risk adjusted capital is over  12% in the quarter and that's up from 8% a year ago. So we're making progress. The business is now focused on its construction and diversified  manufacturing industries and is making good progress also on streamlining  infrastructure. Actually our expenses are down significantly from a year ago  and the productivity of our sales force is improving and the new business  pipeline is getting better.    Home lending -- a strong quarter. Home lending volume from our network  was strong at about $750 million .We had whole loan purchases about $650  million and whole loan sales of about $300. Portfolio margins were flat  sequentially but at the end of Q3 we saw pricing trending higher.     Let me talk about quality. Credit qual ity here remains very good with owned  charge offs in the area of 80 basis points. The interest only product in our  portfolio is 10% of the portfolio but we have - I average FICO scores on the  segment of the portfolio above 650. We do not offer negative amortization  products. We have a very - we had very experienced operators running this  business and we have a very disciplined approach to managing it.     Student Lending we outlined three obj ectives for 2005 for this business after  we have after we made the acquisition. We wanted to grow the school  channel, bring servicing in house and do better than an initial earnings  guidance.     Let me give you the report card. We signed almost 250 schools this year and  third quarter volume from the school channel is up 49% from a year ago.  Consolidation loan volume also continued strong. We are now servicing $1  billion of loan in CIT servicing center in Cleveland, up from just $200 million  or when we acquired the business. And we're putting a significant amount of  new volume into that center. The Student Lending acquisition was earnings neutral in Q1, accretive in Q2 and again accretive in Q3. And all of that is  much better than we model.    With that I'll turn it back to Valerie.    Valerie Gerard:    Thanks Joe.    In an effort to run an efficient Q& A session we are asking that callers limit  their questions to just one. If you have additional questions you can return to  the end of the queue or call Investor Relations once this call is completed.    With that (Jenny), could you please instru ct the callers on how to dial in their  question?    Operator: 	  Thank you. Once again if you have a question press star 1 on your telephone keypad. Please hold for your first question.    Valerie Gerard:    (Jenny) are we getting technical difficulties there?    Operator: 	  Your first question is from Michael Hodes.    Michael Hodes:    Good morning guys. I guess I'll try to limit it to one question.     In terms of the ongoing initiatives fo cused on kind of improving your return  on capital, it was seeing a lot of activity in recent quarters. I was just  wondering, you know, if there are other kind of clear parts of the portfolio that  you are focused on potentially exiting and what kind of time line - how should  we think about that?    Jeffrey Peek:    Well Michael I think two things. One is I think there will be continuous activity .We're going to continue to try to upgrade the portfolio. And so our  strategic planning and capital planning discipline is, you know, every year  we're going to be reevaluating the business as we have the amount of capital  we have behind them and seeing if they make the returns. You know, we have  a corporate hurdle of 15% today and maybe that goes up as the ROE goes up.    Secondly, I think that you know, the two  businesses - and Joe I think was very  specific on it. The two businesses in '04 that didn't meet the hurdle rate, we've  been working very hard on them. In capital finance particularly aerospace,  you know, we see the light at the end of the tunnel there and the team has  done a very good job there. And equipment finance is making very significant  strides.     So we're working hard on those busine sses that don't make the hurdle rate but,  you know, you shouldn't be surprised from time to time, you know, to see us  trade out of a business where we've determined that we can't fix it and the  rates don't meet our criteria over time.    Michael Hodes:    And just for clarification, the sales in home equity that you make seemingly every quarter, that is more credit risked oriented? Or is that fee generation  oriented? What's the thought process there again?    Joseph Leone:    You know Michael we sold this quarter approximately $300 million of assets.    Last quarter it was higher. It's a combination of things. But overall the overall  objective we have and the team that runs that business has is to get the  portfolio to a certain set of demographics that we're comfortable with from an  overall risk perspective, whether they are credit metrics and or interest rate  sensitivity metrics.    Valerie Gerard:    Thanks Michael. Can we have the next question please?    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Chris Brendler with Legg Mason.    Chris Brendler:    I' guess I'll try to wrap it into one question. Looking at trends in new business volume relative to your asset growth and then sort of looking at the business  lines, I'm still calculating a relatively high level of prepayments Can you just -  is that correct and if you could just talk about prepayment trends in the  quarter.   And then maybe also address that relative to competitive conditions?    Joseph Leone:    Yeah I think prepayments are I'll say normal Chris. You know, whatever normal means. It's not the heightened level of prepayments we may have seen  a year or so ago. We still see relatively high velocities in a lot of portfolios but  we've seen that historically.     For example, equipment finance, home lending for sure and a lot of our  portfolios that we look at of that type -- vendor finance I'll throw into that  category --have average durations in the two to three year areas. So we do  have, you know, assets that turn relatively quickly and I think you're seeing  that in the results. But I don't think the prepayment activity has been anything  out outboard the norm.    Now turning over to the bigger ticket ar eas I think that's more of a risk  management analysis that maybe you're seeing being factored into the  numbers, is we have been building our syndication function in the commercial  side in a very robust way. We always had the capability. We have drawn it all  together under one basket and one leadership.     And with credit costs where they ar e, with economy where it is and the  liquidity in the market that we see, we take the opportunity - probably took more of an opportunity in '05 than we did in '04 to manage the risk side of the  portfolio in that way. So syndication sales.    Chris Brendler:    All right just a quick follow up and a suggestion if you could start, since that is getting to be a greater part of your story, if you could start disclosing - add  sales and syndications in terms of the dollar amounts in the release that would  be helpful.    Valerie Gerard:    That’s' a great suggestion. We will put that on the to do list for the next quarter. Thanks Chris.    Chris Brendler:    Thanks Valerie.    Valerie Gerard:    Next question please.    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Joel Houck with Wachovia Securities.    Joel Houck: 	  Okay thanks good morning. I guess the resiliency in the margins is probably most impressive this quarter, but toward the end of the quarter, you know, I  guess the Fed kind of came out and made comments indicating that maybe  there was a lot more tightening remaining. In light of that how do you guys  think of product mix and pricing strategy going forward if we're going to go to  a 4.50% or 5% Fed funds raise as opposed to maybe stopping at 4% like we  thought maybe at the end of last quarter?    Jeffrey Peek:    Well I think our discipline on pricing has been pretty good and I think that was part of it. You know, as you know we're like 95% match funded. So I  think the question really is if they continue to raise what's that going to do to  the flow of business?     Right now actually we're seeing a pretty  good flow of business. I think people  came back from the summer and decided that they wanted to move forward on  a number of fronts. But I think you know, we're - if the rates go up we'll have  to work on pricing.     Joe do you want to add anything to that?    Joseph Leone:    You know we have a portfolio of businesses and - Joel and, you know, some of them - if rates go higher and the economy is somewhat a little bit more a  little weaker than the steam it has right now, we have other businesses that  kick in in a more interesting and more profitable way, including our  businesses that look at supplying capital to mid-sized businesses for  restructuring or balance sheet improvement.    So we think of it as a portfolio of  businesses with some businesses getting a  little weaker in higher rate environments and many businesses getting  stronger.    Joel Houck: 	  Okay, thanks.    Valerie Gerard:    Thanks, Joel.  Next question please, operator.    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Eric Wasserstrom with UBS.    Eric Wasserstrom:   Thank you.  Joe, did I understand you correct that the issuance of the preferred and the replacement therefore of some of the common added one percentage  point to ROE and if that’s the case, wouldn’t that suggest that actually ROE  declined sequentially?    Joseph Leone:    Yeah.  It ended about 1% return on common equity.  I guess the, you know, basic - overall basic earnings trend is higher.  We do have the preferred  dividend expense running through the earnings.  So let me look at that one,  Eric, and I’ll get back to you, but that’s basically what the finance is.    We have - instead of the dividends  running through the capital account, now  they’re running through the earnings stream.  So let me look at that arithmetic  for you and we’ll get back to you.    Eric Wasserstrom:   All right.  Thank you.    Valerie Gerard:    Thanks, Eric.  Next question please.    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Lehman Brothers.    (Chris): 	  Joe, just a clarification on the tax.  You know, there’s permanent improvement from moving some of the leases over to the Dublin location, right, but it  sounded like you said it may jump back up to the low 30s in the fourth  quarter.  I just wondered if you could, you know, break that out and then…?    Joseph Leone:    Yes.  The reported tax rate is about 30% and that includes the reserve release that we identified as a highlighted item.  Taking that out, the tax regrade for  the quarter was a little less than 35%.  And we’re thinking about the tax rate  for Q4 and all of ’05 to be in about the 35% area.  So think about it as  basically flat, excluding that one-time reserve release that we profiled as  noteworthy.  Okay?    (Chris): 	  Thanks, Joe.  And I can’t get another one in I know so I’ll come back in.    Valerie Gerard:    Thanks, (Chris).  We’ll take the next question now, (Jenny).    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Laura Kaster with Sandler O’Neill.    Laura Kaster:    Yes.  I thought it was overall a really solid quarter.  One area that kind of was just (really) relative to my expectations was operating expenses.  Now I have  no problem with them going up if you’re investing in your infrastructure but  you had said before that operating expenses would drop (finesse) or the  efficiency ratio would improve.  Can you give us a direction of where we  might be seeing that going from here?    Jeffrey Peek:    Well, we’re - I think as we’ve said, we’re - operating expenses is probably one area that we’re sensitive about.  We’ve been trying to streamline the backend,  probably identified $40 to $50 million in cost savings this year.  And as you  saw in our second quarter charge, took charges to really locate about $25  million of those cost savings.  And much of that is going into the front-end,  whether it’s the cost of bringing on salesforce.com or I think at last count, we  hired over 40 group leaders and senior originators in our large ticket business.   So I think we continue to work hard on that and - but we are investing in the  growth businesses and we’re investing in the sales force.    Laura Kaster:    Okay.  Thank you.    Valerie Gerard:    Next question please.    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Meredith Whitney with CIBC World Markets.    Meredith Whitney:    Good morning.  I have a question that I hope you guys did not address in your opening remarks, related to fee income as a percentage of your total  revenues.  And I wanted to know, this quarter was the - relatively smaller  component of (seed) income related to narrow margins on your fee products or is it seasonal in nature and can you give me some guidance in terms of  where fee income as a percentage of the whole pie goes over the next several  quarters.    Joseph Leone:    Sure, Meredith.  No, we didn’t talk about that explicitly.  I think the fee and other income, I call it non-spread revenue number, is very strong.  It logs  down a bit from Q2; Q2 was exceptionally strong.    And we have some fees that are core  that we carve quarterly, like factory  commissions is, a varied annuity like component, that actually goes up  seasonally as in the second half of the year.  But other fees, some have some  episodic nature to them.    Having said all that, some of our new  initiatives are intended to build that  non-spread revenue component of our earnings.  And I mean it in a - you  know, in a value-added way.  You can see that leasing gains were relatively  stable quarter-to-quarter, securitization gains were relatively stable quarter-to- quarter.    But the new business initiatives, whethe r they’re healthcare, advisory on the  M&A side, syndication, are all designed to continue to improve our overall  level of spread - non-spread revenues.  So my expectation is as these business  build-outs take hold, that that fee component will grow.  But having said that,  not apologetic for Q3, I think it’s a very solid core performance with very  strong baseline fees.    Meredith Whitney:    Oh, I agree.  I was just directional - that - your answer makes a lot of sense  to me.  Thanks.    Valerie Gerard:  Thanks, Meredith.  Can we go to the next question, please?    Operator: 	  Your next question is from (Bob Napelli) with Piper Jaffray.    (Bob Napelli):    Good morning.  (Bob Napelli) from Piper.  A question, I was wondering if  you could give a little more color on your healthcare business, on the size of  that business, and maybe the makeup of the assets and the growth that you  experienced in the quarter?    Jeffrey Peek:    Sure.  Sure.  You know, when we entered 2005, we had kind of one healthcare business which was vendor financed.  We did finance cat scan machines.  And  we’ve steadily grown that by bringing in people to cover various sub- segments, you know, such as large hospitals, skilled nursing centers, extended  care.    So we now have three or four different  teams and our headcount grew to about  50 to 60 people and then with the acquisition of healthcare business credit, we  added another 65 people.  So we’re up about 140 people.  I think originations  in the third quarter were about 125 million, which is - and they’ve been  running - I think the second quarter they were maybe 150 million.    I think with the acquisition of HPCC,  I think total assets in the healthcare  sector are up a little over a billion dollars from about 300 this time last year.   So, you know, this has been one of the growth engines we’ve built in the  portfolio and, you know, we’re excited about it and love the quality of people  we’ve been able to attract as well as the leadership of HPCC.    (Bob Napelli):    What kind of return on equity are you getting and what kind of growth would you expect to get?  Is that going to be one of the fastest growth businesses that  CIT over the next several years?    Jeffrey Peek:    Well, we’re cautious but we think it will grow steadily.  We’re - you know, it’s 18% of the economy and it was less than 1% of our assets.  So we thought  we had a lot of headroom on that.  And, you know, this is the first year  they’ve been together so they’ll be profitable this year and we anticipate that  they’ll make the corporate return, you know, in a reasonable period of time.    (Bob Napelli):    Thank you.    Valerie Gerard:    Thanks, (Bob); appreciate the question.  Our next caller, please.    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Craig Maurer with Fulcrum.    Craig Maurer:    Good morning.    Jeffrey Peek:    Good morning.    Joseph Leone:    Hi, Craig.    Craig Maurer:    My question is regarding the home equity business.  With rates continuing to rise, I was hoping you can discuss your expectations for that business going  into ’06.  Thanks.    Joseph Leone:    Sure.  There’s been a lot of obviously news on home prices, home lending businesses specifically.  We had a very strong third quarter.  Clearly, lending  volumes in the market could come down and I think many financial  institutions have said that.    We think we’re well positioned here.   As I said, we have a very experienced  management team that’s been with the company a while.  I think we have a very disciplined approach to doing - to look at our portfolio demographics,  some of which I gave you and many of which we put in our Qs.    And we think that as interest rates ri se and some of the more exotic products  sort of get priced away from the marketplace, we have a core strategy that fits  in very well in the marketplace.    So having said that, overall, you know,  refinancing boom could be over and  home sales could be lower so we build that into our expectations.  But the  other side of it is we think we have a very competitive cost structure, a very  smart credit screen, and a very experienced management team.  So I think it  could perform well in just about any environment.    Craig Maurer:    Okay, thanks.    Valerie Gerard:    Great.  Do we have any more callers out there?    Operator: 	  Yes.  Your next question is a follow-up from Bruce Harting with Lehman Brothers.    Valerie Gerard:    Excellent.    Jeffrey Peek:    Welcome back, Bruce.    Bruce Harting:    Hello.  Thanks.  So I guess on the expense side, as the initiatives - is the timing on this such that you bring in more talent, you create new incentives,  and you’ve changed the comp structure somewhat from last year.  So the good  news is we won’t see that fourth quarter bulge that occurred last year with  bonuses and things like that.  Is it more spread out over the year, is that one of  the takeaways we should get from this?    Jeffrey Peek:    Well, I think - that sounded like a number of questions.  But I’ll try - maybe I should pick the one I want to answer.  You know, I would say Joe and the  other folks are very much on top of the accrual and, you know, if you  followed it during the year, you know, we have a fair amount of compensation  in terms of restricted (sot) that we call performance shares.  And part of -  frankly, part of the increase in operating expenses has been us truing up every  quarter what those performance shares are going to look like.  So, you know,  we’re watching the accruals quite closely.    I think that if you look  at the third quarter, you know, several of our  businesses have some seasonality to them but what we were encouraged about  was it was very broad-based in terms of asset growth coming from, you know,  almost all of the portfolios, you know, with the exception of equipment  finance where we’re - have done some…    ((Crosstalk))    Jeffrey Peek:    …and they’re doing well.  So we felt good about that and we think - we spend a lot of time focusing on sales and, you know, we think some of this coming  through is the beginning of that focus and the beginning of the investments  we’ve made.    Valerie Gerard:    Great.  Thanks, Jeff.  Could we go - or before we go onto the next caller, I think Joe wants to say something.    Joseph Leone:    Can I go back to Eric Wasserstrom’s question regarding ROE?  The net impact after preferred dividends and the buyback of the stock in the quarter  was about 75 basis points on the ROE.  So if you look at it quarter-to-quarter,  then you get to a flat ROE.  Why is that?    If - for those of you who remember, la st quarter we had an abnormally low  core tax rate because we had to true-up the tax rate for the full year in that  quarter.  So apples to apples, if you normalize the tax rates, the core ROE in  the quarter is slightly better this quarter, excluding the highlighted -  noteworthy and highlighted items versus last quarter.    Eric, I hope that helps an d I hope you’re still on the phone; if not, IR is going  to follow-up with you anyway.    Valerie Gerard:    Great.  Thanks.  Do we have another caller?    Operator: 	  Yes.  Your next question is from (Bob Napelli) with Piper Jaffray.    (Bob Napelli):    Can you give a little more color on your Capital Finance business?  I was wondering if you could - it looks like - you know, just looking at the segment  data that the income, if you back out the $86 million, was up substantially  quarter-over-quarter.  I was wondering if that’s a clean look?    And I was wondering if you maybe could  give some discussion on - or some  color on the pricing trends?  Like would the lease prices on rail cars - I know  they had gone up quite a bit from the trough a few years ago.  Have prices  continued to come up?  And are you benefiting significantly from (low) of  these rates running off?    Jeffrey Peek:    Well, I think we - lease trades both on rail and aerospace, you know, have come up quite a bit anecdotally on both claims and rail.  We’ve seen 100%  increases.  Now you’ll have to remember, we price maybe 20 - we repriced  maybe 20% of the portfolio on an annual basis but lease rates for airplanes, as  we’ve said, have been probably year-over-year up 25% for your best plane.     And in the rail segment, it would be probably a little bit less than that but  certainly 15% to 20%.    So - and as Joe said, we’re at 99% ut ilization both on rail and aerospace.  So -  plus we’re stretching out the terms of the lease when we reprice.  So we like  both of those businesses as well.  Joe, do you have a comment on the  numbers?    Joseph Leone:    Yeah.  The ROE has improved significant quarter-over-quarter, you know, on an operating basis.  And the rail business has had an outstanding year.  Jeff,  you know, mentioned some of the pricing trends.  But we added portfolio in  the quarter, we made some equipment acquisitions to fill out the fleet, as I  mentioned earlier.  So that’s a plus.  The airplanes, we’ve mentioned the  trends there.    The other item in the quarter is we  transferred some of the other plane  businesses we had around the company like financing of the (Net Jets)  business into Capital Finance in the quarter so we have some of that benefit.   Having said all that, the core ROE, apples to apples, quarter-to-quarter,  continues to improve, driven by the commercial aerospace improvement.    (Bob Napelli):    Thank you.    Valerie Gerard:    Great.  (Jenny), could we have the next caller, please?    Operator: 	  Yes.  Your next question is from (Jordan Heimowitz) with (unintelligible)  Financial.    (Jordan Heimowitz):    Hey, guys.  Thanks for the pronunciation.  A couple quick questions; one,  did you have any gains on sale of mortgage loans in the quarter, like you  shifted some sub-(pry) mortgage loans last time (in and out)?    Joseph Leone:    Sure, I’ll take that.  As I mentioned in the - in my opening comments, (Jordan Heimowitz), we sold $300 million of loans in the quarter.  And generally, the  pricing we see now and we see pricing, you know, somewhat lower than we  did a year ago obviously we sold them for prices of over 2% or so.  So there  were some gains in the earnings from that.     (Jordan Heimowitz):    Okay does that…    Joseph Leone:    Hopefully that was responsive.  Did I get you (Jordan)?    (Jordan Heimowitz):    That was real good.  Second is can you comment on the credit quality in  the healthcare finance portfolio or is it too soon to kind of make an estimate as  to how that’s going?    Joseph Leone:  I…    Jeffrey Peek:  (Unintelligible).    Joseph Leone:  I’ll just start with the numbers.    I’d be happy to tell you how they’re going.  They’re going great.  The delinquent - just about all of the receivables are  current.  We have less than 20 basis points of delinquency in the portfolio and  obviously that includes the loans we acquired in the acquisition.    (Jordan Heimowitz):    Thanks a lot guys and great asset growth, best quarter in a long time.    Jeffrey Peek:    Thank you.    Valerie Gerard:    We appreciate that (Jordan).  Do we have another caller?    Operator: 	  Yes your next question is from David Hochstim with Bear Sterns.    David Hochstim:    Hi I wonder if you can just clarify the out of production aircraft that were sold and how those numbers show up between the June and the September break  down of the portfolio?  And I wonder how much of the value of those planes  changed over the last 12 months as lease rates have gone up on desirable air  craft?  And did you not need to mark those to fair value because of the kinds  of leases they were in or financings or and are they’re other aircraft that are  still in the portfolio that might not be marked to market?    Valerie Gerard:    I think that’s four questions, David, I’m going to stop right now.    David Hochstim:    I think that’s really one.    Joseph Leone:    Which one is it?  I’ll try to remember it all David, I don’t know if I remember it all.  First of all in the schedule - I think the first question you asked was in  the schedule the airplanes where are these planes?    David Hochstim:    Yes.    Joseph Leone:    And I’ve got two answers for you.  One in the schedule of managed assets they’re in assets held for sale.  So look there under capital finance.  On the  schedule where we break out all the planes they’re where they were.  So, you  know, if they were narrow body, they were in the narrow body; if they were in  the US, they were in the US.  We thought we’d show you all the metrics  apples to apples, that’s two.  Three, I don’t know the specific answer in terms of the values of the planes versus a year ago.  Rental rates have improved  somewhat so that would have to factor into our analysis.    David Hochstim:    But even on these they’ve improved?    Joseph Leone:    Yes -- less so, though.  Less so and the going forward look as they would  improve even less so.  I’d say lastly as you know and we talk about our  accounting policies on this the long life asset policy is that undiscounted cash  flow test.  Our intent on these 50 aircraft is now changed so we have to value  them at a lower of cost to market or, you know, or a current value standard.   So that’s what happened.    David Hochstim:    Okay.    Joseph Leone:    Hopefully I got all those pieces of that one question.    David Hochstim:    Yes thank you.    Valerie Gerard:    Great next question please.    Operator: 	  Your next question is from Joel Houck with Wachovia Securities.    Joel Houck: 	  Yes just wanted to follow up on the big increase in tangible book value per share in the quarter.  I think it went up a 1.50.  You know you only earned  1.06 is there market to market adjustment for the balance sheet that I missed  that maybe you talked about earlier?    Joseph Leone:    You got me on that one.  I think the share count is lower that should, that may enter into it.  But I have to think about the arithmetic there because the share count is lower.  I think, I mean the book value, you know, is changing but it  may be the share count.  But we’ll get back to you so you got me on that.    Joel Houck: 	  Okay great.    Valerie Gerard:    Great I think this’ll be the last caller operator.    Operator: 	  Your last question is from (Mark Sherlomo) with Barclays.    (Mark Sherlomo):   Good morning guys.      Jeffrey Peek:    Good morning.    (Mark Sherlomo):   Just a quick question about sort of geography and the aircraft portfolio with, maybe with the disposal of the this quarter and it looks like international  growth is certainly ramping up.  Do you expect your portfolio to diminish in  the North American market from kind of the 21% level going forward?  I  mean are you specifically targeting that or is it just sort of where the demand  develops?    Jeffrey Peek:    The answer is we clearly anticipate that going down.  So I mean the North    American component I think will continue to decline as we deliver new  aircraft.    (Mark Sherlomo):   Okay great.  No specific target though or anything?    Jeffrey Peek:    No I think it’s really a resolved of better credits elsewhere as well as a stronger growth market.    (Mark Sherlomo):   Great thank you very much.     Valerie Gerard:    Thanks for your question (Mark).  With that I’d like to thank everyone for attending our call today.  As always investor relations will be posting the  prepared remarks to today’s call on our website in about an hour.  And we’ll  have a complete transcript hopefully by tomorrow.      So with that please free to call Pam,  (Steve) or myself with any questions and  we look forward to seeing you on our investor day on November 8.  Thanks  have a great day.    Operator: 	  Thank you for attending today’s conference you may now disconnect.    "

"5676","GCI","Q3","2005","    GANNETT CO., INC.   THIRD QUARTER 2005    CONFERENCE CALL AND WEB CAST    OCTOBER 11, 2005      PRESENTATION    Operator     Operator: Good day, everyone, and welcome to Gannett's third quarter earnings  conference call.     Today's call is being recorded. Due to the large number of callers, we will limit  you to one question or comment. We greatly appreciate your cooperation and  courtesy.     Our speakers today will be Mr. Craig Dubow, President and Chief Executive Officer, and Gracia Martore, Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. At  this time I'd like to turn the call over to Ms. Gracia Martore. Please go ahead,  ma'am.  Gracia Martore  - Gannett - CFO     Thanks very much and good morning. Welcome to our call and our Webcast to  review our third quarter results. We hope you have a chance to review our press  releases from this morning which also can be found at www.gannett.com.     With me today are Doug McCorkindale, Chairman, Craig Dubow, President and  CEO, and Jeff Heinz, Director of Investor Relations.     As we noted in our press releases, two separate transactions in the quarter had a  very significant impact on the reporting of our results. The first was our asset  exchange with Knight Ridder, in which Gannett received the Tallahassee (NYSE:FL)  Democrat and cash consideration in exchange for newspapers in Olympia and Bellingham, Washington, and Boise, Idaho.     The transaction was accounted for as a sale of discontinued operations and a  purchase of the Tallahassee newspaper. The contributions from the former    Gannett properties have been reclassified as discontinued operations in our financial statement.     The asset exchange resulted in an after-tax gain which is also included in  discontinued operations for the third quarter. And we have also gone back and  reclassified last year's quarter to reflect the discontinued operations.     As you saw this morning Gannett earned $1.14 per diluted share from operations  this quarter including $0.01 per share, or approximately $3.6 million of after- tax  income from those discontinued operations. Basically, the income from  Bellingham, Boise and Olympia for the two months that we owned them in the  quarter. The gain associated with the sale of these three properties for accounting  purposes was $18.8 million after-tax, or $0.08 per diluted share. That gain is also  included in discontinued operations.     And during the quarter we also reorganized the Detroit Newspaper Agency. As  part of that transaction Knight Ridder sold its newspaper interest in Detroit to  Gannett and MediaNews Group. Together we formed the Detroit Newspaper Partnership. We acquired the Detroit Free Press and MediaNews Group acquired the Detroit News from us.     The Detroit transaction significantly impacts the results in our newspaper  segment.     As you saw from the release this morning, on a reported basis, newspaper  publishing revenues rose 7.1% while newspaper expenses increased 9%.  However, the reported numbers are not on a comparable basis year-over-year.     Beginning August 1st, 100% of Detroit's results have been fully consolidated in  each line of the financial statements of Gannett along with a minority interest  charge for MediaNews Group's interest. Prior to that date the NIBT from our  50% interest in Detroit had been reported as one line item in other operating  revenues.     So the reported results for the third quarter of 2005 include two months of 100%  consolidation and one month of a one line 50% NIBT item in other operating  revenue, while at the same time 2004's third quarter's reported results included  three months of a one line 50% NIBT item in other operating revenue.     To put this on a more comparable basis, pro forma  - that is assuming we owned  100% of Detroit and some other small acquisitions that we completed, had been  included for all of the third quarter 2005, and all of the third quarter of 2004 -  then newspaper operating revenues would have increased 1.3% and newspaper  expenses would have increased 1.7%.     Hopefully you're still all with me on this. To put our expenses for the quarter  into further perspective, we reported that newsprint expense was up 7.7%, which  consisted of a 6.4% increase year-over-year in price and a little over 1% increase  in usage.     But again, Detroit impacted those numbers. So on a pro forma basis newsprint  expense actually was up about 1.5%, with an almost 6% increase in price, and  about a 4% decline in usage.     Finally, looking at pro forma cash costs excluding newsprint, they were up about  1.5% for the quarter in the newspaper segment. That increase includes a couple  of million dollars related to higher fuel costs and some hurricane-related  expenses.     As we indicated when we completed the transactions, the full consolidation of Detroit's results would have a negative impact on our margins in the near-term.  However, we see opportunity to expand them over the intermediate to long- term.  Greater control of the partnership, the conversion of the Detroit News to a  morning publication, which will maintain two editorial voices in Detroit while  providing a stronger ad platform, and the benefit of the new press facility all are  opportunities for higher levels of profitability.     Let me make one further comment on newsprint. As we previously told you, we  have secured fixed price terms for newsprint through the end of this year for a  substantial amount of our newsprint requirements.     We know these are challenging times for paper makers and publishers and we  genuinely understand the economic pressures facing suppliers. However,  publishers also face similar challenges. Yet we remain hopeful that both sides  will continue efforts to minimize market volatility.     The ability to have set pricing over a six-month period is a good start. We are  confident that consistent pricing initiatives over longer periods will ultimately  support the health and stability of both of our industries.     Now let me finish up with some balance sheet items.     Total debt at quarter end stood at $5.4 billion and cash marketable securities  were $54 million. At this point, our all-in cost of debt is about 4.3%.     Capital expenditures for the quarter totaled $54 million roughly. We are on track  to spend around $275 million on capital expenditures for the year including the  ramp up of Captivate.     With respect to shares outstanding, basic shares at the end of the quarter were  240.9 million and averaged 242.9 million for the quarter. We repurchased 3.6  million shares during the quarter and year-to-date we have repurchased  approximately 14.3 million shares for almost $1.1 billion.     At these price levels we continue to think of Gannett as a very good investment  of our free cash flow.     Finally, before I turn the call over to Craig, our conference call and Webcast  today may include forward-looking statements and our actual results may differ.  Factors that might cause them to differ are outlined in great detail in our SEC  filings.     This presentation also includes certain non-GAAP financial measures and we  have provided a reconciliation of those measures to the most directly comparable  GAAP measures in the press release and on the Investor Relations portion of our Web site.     And now I'll turn it over to Craig.       Craig Dubow - Gannett – President and CEO     Thank you, Gracia, and good morning to everyone.     Before I jump into the details regarding our quarterly results, I'd like to take a  moment to commend our employees in the Gulf Coast region, as well as the  Gannett employees that volunteered their help and efforts in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina and Rita.     As you saw from our press release this morning and as Gracia mentioned,  earnings per share for the third quarter excluding the gain from discontinued  operations totaled $1.14.     Operating revenues for continuing operations increased 4.1% to $1.9 billion for  the quarter. Operating cash flow from continuing operations was $541 million,  and income from continuing operations was approximately $275 million.     On a pro forma basis our operating revenues declined slightly less than 1% for  the quarter. Last year we had over $50 million of Olympic and political revenues  from our television stations, and USA TODAY also received about $4 million of  Olympics-related spending.     This was just too steep a mountain to climb in this challenging advertising  environment and with the U.K. economy slowing as it has.     Let's turn first to our newspaper business.     Pro forma local advertising in our newspapers rose just over 1% in the quarter. In  the U.S. across all products, the health, financial and telecommunications  categories were positive for the quarter, although the furniture, restaurant and  home improvement categories lagged last year's third quarter results.     In September of 2004, our pro forma local ad revenues were up over 10% - our  toughest monthly local ad comparison for the year.     Similarly, we faced a very tough quarterly comparison as third quarter of 2004  local revenues were up 7.5%. Pro forma local classified revenues in our U.S. and  U.K. community newspapers were up 1.4% in the quarter.     Help wanted revenues increased 2%. Real estate was up 3%, but auto was down  over 9%. These results reflect positive growth trends domestically offset partially  by the weakness in the U.K.     The strength in our domestic community newspapers this quarter, much like the  second quarter, came primarily from employment and real estate.     Our employment numbers in the U.S. continued to be a bright spot for us. For  both September and the third quarter the pro forma growth rate of employment  classified was approximately 14%.     The double-digit growth in employment continues to be driven primarily by the West. Cities like Phoenix, Palm Springs and Fort Collins and in the South in  places like Broward and Fort Myers although they also had very good growth in  the Midwest as well.     Pro forma classified real estate at our community newspapers was fairly solid as  well with growth rates approaching 7% in both September and the quarter.  Classified auto, as we have noted, continues to be very soft.     We continue to invest in our strategy to develop non-dailies and niche  publications which are affiliated with our local daily newspapers and are  profitably expanding the unduplicated reach we have in our markets. In the  quarter our non-dailies, which do not include publications such as Clipper,  Nursing Spectrum or Army Times, once again had mid-teens revenue growth.     As you saw from our report this morning, national advertising was flat for the  quarter. USA TODAY's ad revenues were down almost 3% once again reflecting  the tough comparisons primarily from the demand related to the Summer  Olympics in 2004's third quarter and the choppy national ad environment.     USA TODAY's ad revenues were down 1.2% in July, down 17% in August and  up over 8% in September. For the third quarter the entertainment and telecom  categories in addition to automotive were strong, while travel, package goods  and advocacy categories trailed results in the third quarter of 2004.     As I touched on briefly, our U.K. results continue to be negatively impacted by  the weak U.K. economy. Pro forma revenues for Newsquest for the quarter in  pounds were down 5%.     Newsquest management has done an excellent job controlling costs. Expenses for  the quarter, even including a 7% price increase on newsprint, declined over 2%  year-over-year. Newsquest's operating profit, again in pounds, declined 10%.     Classified revenues at Newsquest, which were almost 70% of ad revenues in the  quarter, continued to be soft with the auto or motors and the lucrative  employment categories the most hard hit.     Turning to online revenues for the entire Company, increased approximately  29% for quarter led by a 46% increase at our domestic community newspapers.  At this pace we are on track to have about $275 million to $300 million of revenue  from our Internet activities this year.     We are pleased with our Internet initiatives to date and we are particularly  enthused about the potential of PointRoll from both the business and the rich  media perspective.     We are very pleased as well with the progress CareerBuilder continues to make.     Revenue for the CareerBuilder network for the third quarter of 2005 was up 72%  year-over-year. CareerBuilder network traffic for September of 2005 was up 31%  to approximately 20 million unique users compared to last year.     Moving now to Broadcast.     As we noted in our earnings release, revenues for the quarter were down over  19%. Excluding Captivate, television revenues were down over 20%.     Ad revenues declined with a lack of over $20 million in political-driven ad  spending and almost $30 million in ad demand related to the Summer Olympic  games. Excluding political, the auto, retail, restaurants and telecommunications  categories were negative year-over-year, while the package goods, services and  medical and dental categories surpassed last year's results.     Local was down 11% for the quarter while national declined 33%.     Our latest pacings for the fourth quarter are down in the low to mid-teens,  reflecting roughly 48 million in ad revenues related to political ad spending that  benefited the fourth quarter of '04. November and December are stronger than  October which includes the lion’s share of political spending in 2004.     Local is stronger than national at this point.     Pacings continue to be highly volatile and subject to weekly change but this is  where we stand at this moment. We'll keep you updated in our monthly reports  as the quarter progresses.     Now looking forward into the fourth quarter. We face tough comparisons, again,  in the fourth quarter particularly in the broadcasting segment, which, as I just  noted, faces almost $50 million of politically-driven ad demand associated with  last year's fall election.     Our U.K. properties have responded to the economic downturn in the  challenging ad environment but unfortunately the economic outlook at the  moment continues to be difficult. Domestically, our community newspapers are very well-positioned in the markets they serve to maximize the coverage with  advertisers and consumers.     Similarly, USA TODAY will continue to successfully leverage its brands and as  always we will continue to maintain our financial discipline and focus.     At this point we'll stop and be happy to take any of your questions. Thank you.    "
"3275","OSTK","Q2","2005","    Operator  Good morning, everyone. My name is Erica and I will be your conference moderator today. I would like to welcome everyone to Overstock.com's second quarter 2005 financial results conference call. At this time all lines are in a listen-only mode. Later,we'll announce the opportunity for questions and instructions will be given at that time. A web based slide presentation will be used during this call and is available for viewing over the Internet on the Company web site, www.shareholder.com/overstock. [OPERATOR INSTRUCTIONS]. This call is being recorded and will be available for replay beginning today at 3:00 p.m. eastern time through 11:59 eastern time August 10th. The replay can be accessed by dialing 888-203-1112 and entering the code of 4443183.  At this time, I would like to turn the conference over to Mr. David Chidester, Overstock.com's Senior Vice President of Finance. Mr. Chidester, you may begin.  David Chidester, Overstock.com - SVP, Finance  Thank you. Good morning and welcome to Overstock.com's second quarter 2005 conference call. Participating with me on the call is Dr. Patrick Byrne, Chairman and President.  Before I turn to the financial results, please keep in mind that the following discussion and responses to your questions reflect management's views as of today, August 3, 2005 only. As you listen to the call, I encourage you to have our press release in front of you, since our financial results, detailed commentary, and the President's letter to shareholders are included and will correspond to much of the discussion that follows.  As we share information today to help you better understand our business, it is important to keep in mind that we'll make statements in the course of this conference call that state our intentions, hopes, beliefs, expectations or predictions of the future. These constitute forward-looking statements for the purpose of the Safe Harbor Provisions under the Private Securities Litigation Reform within the meaning of Section 27A of the Securities Exchange Act of 1933, and Section 21E of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934.  These forward-looking statements involve certain risks and uncertainties that could cause Overstock.com's actual results to different materially from those projected in these forward-looking statements. Overstock.com disclaims any intention or obligation to revise any forward-looking statements. Additional information concerning important factors that could cause actual results to differ in the forward-looking statements is contained from time to time in documents filing with the SEC, included but not limited to its most recent reports on forms 10-K, 10-Q, 8-K, and S-1.  With that said, I'd like to review some of the financial highlights from this past quarter. Please note that all comparisons will be against our results for the comparable period of 2004, unless otherwise stated. Total revenue in the quarter was $151 million, up 72%. Gross margins were 14.7% in Q2 up from 11.3% gross profit dollars increased 124% to 22 million. Operating expenses grew 129% to 28 million.  The overall increase in operating expenses was driven by a 233% increase in technology costs and 119% increase in sales and marketing. Other G&A increased just over 100%. We remain comfortable with our overall G&A and technology estimate for full year 2005, of 60 million, plus or minus 5%.  Our operating loss was 6.1 million, or 4% of sales, versus 2.4%. However, we had 3.5 million of net nonoperating income as a result of a $4.1 million gain on the retirement of 33 million of our convertible debt. So our net loss was 2.5 million, compared to a net loss of 2.3 million, both $0.13 per share. We ended the quarter with 120 million in cash and marketable securities. We had total cash outflow during the quarter of 65 million. 10 million of outflow from operations, 11 million for capital expenditures, and an additional 44 million related to stock and bond buybacks during the quarter.  In total for the buyback program, including the 48 million of outflows for the structured buybacks that we had in Q1, we used approximately 64 million to buy back 1.7 million shares and used and additional 28 million to retire 33 million of debt. One last point to keep in mind regarding cash is that on July 1, 2005, we completed our acquisition of SkiWest for 25 million of cash. That being offset by approximately 8 million of cash returned to us in the first week of July as part of the closing out of the the structured buybacks, leaving us with just over 100 million the beginning the quarter.  Finally the average invoice increased to $97 from $86 last year, and up from $91 in Q1. This is partially due to a change in the sales mix, as BMV fell to 10% of our total gross bookings, versus 12% last year. That covers my financial overview.  I would like to turn the call now over to Patrick.  Dr. Patrick Byrne, Overstock.com - Chairman and President  Thanks for that nice summary. We have got a great slide deck today. I'll keep this preamble short.  One -- first, I'm sure I sound like a broken record quarter after quarter, but I'll reiterate the Overstock mantra: Our internal stretch goal for the Company is 100% growth, break even bottom line, with “break even” defined as, “plus or minus 1% GAAP net income.” Growth at this point is 86%, not too far away from what I want. I expect our Q3 operating results to be similar to Q2 operating results, but for the full year, we should be able to break even, if not above.  Our model that we are developing (and I'll be getting into a little bit how we've gotten quite a bit more sophisticated in our modeling), shows something funny: that we are learning that the more we push out there in Q3 - it seems to be for every extra dollar we push out in Q3 we make back a dollar or maybe more than a dollar in Q4.  I'm often asked how long it is we're going to chant this Overstock mantra. I thought it was time I defined for folks where I'm really shooting for as a place I'd like to be. I want Overstock.com to be a company with revenues north of $2 billion, growing at 25% a year, with operating income of 4% or 5%. And which would bring us to the $6 billion range -- actually  GAAP income of 3-5%, I'm sorry. That's something I think we can achieve the year after next.  We have to keep growing at these kind of paces and get to 900 plus or minus 50 or 70 this year, and 1.5 billion or something next year. That would position us to get us north of $2 billion the year after next, slow down our growth and have a company that can make a lot of money.  Like any -- we call this O Town. That's where we're trying to settle. O Town must complete certain infrastructure before the infrastructure is needed. In a letter to owners, I described some stairstep improvements in our technology infrastructure. These have not been cheap. But to continue the metaphor, I would say during the last nine months really we've gone from being a country hamlet with dirt roads to a modern town with asphalt streets. We're shooting to be like Singapore. We're making progress in online advertising. We're just at the point where we can really focus on our site design, propeller, CRM initiatives,and improved IT infrastructure that supports the projects mentioned in my letter.  A couple of quick announcements: Katherine Huang is gone. She was our head of IR and I know many of you knew her. She served wonderfully for us for two years. I believe I actually said this a conference call or two ago. She's actually married to a doctor who finished his residency here in Utah, Dr. Hadley, and they moved off, he took a position in Michigan and they moved off together. I think people knew about that six months to a year ago. I'm sure that won't keep there from being any stories about, “The Mystery of Where Kathryn Huang Went.”  But she -- I know a lot of people were given prior notice.  She's been replaced by Kevin Moon who is terrific. Kevin comes from your side of the table. He's an investor. He worked at a local investment fund called CrossRoads. MBA. Terrific. We're happy to have him aboard.  Secondly, thought I'd give people advance notice that I've asked my father to become Chairman, and we're going to do that I think at the next board meeting. I'm doing that just because I like -- I think that the Chairman-CEO relationship is an analog to the father-son relationship, and it's healthy corporate governance to split CEO and Chairman. He was Chairman the first couple few years of our existence. Because of Sarbanes-Oxley he had to get off the board. So I'm letting you know in advance, I'm going to propose him for that. I'm not sure if nominated he'll run and if wins he'll serve, but we're trying to get him to be chairman.  Let me turn to some slides that will give you a sense of how your business is running. As I recall, you folks are about 15 seconds behind me on this, so I'm going to try to adjust my voice to respect that fact. On slide 3, we -- we've gone from 87.8 to 150 million. 72% growth there. 124% growth in the gross profits line. 119% in sales and marketing. G&A, other than technology, 101. Technology and depreciation is what is short here, and that's really because we hit -- we've taken this step over a stair. Most of the quote, unquote increase in operating loss came in this increase in technology spending. I'm very glad we've done it and I'll be going extensively into what you got for your money.  Slide 4, again, 72% growth on GAAP revenue. Gross margins did slide a bit. And I described in my letter what's going on. (Now, every time I try to explain what's going on, I know I have some saying out there, you're making excuses. I'm not. I literally take me letter to the Board and the CFO's letter to the Board and I clean it up a little bit and I give it to you guys.) So we actually did make a little bit of improvement in the expenses within logistics. The projects that we thought were going to deliver 20 to 30 basis points a quarter are two or three months delayed in their implementation. I thought they would be done in March, April. It really happened in June, July, so they didn't really affect the quarter much. They did give us about 20 basis points. We had this 55 basis point head wind as a result of the way we expense inbound freight, which is something we might revisit at the end of the year. What happens is we sort of had a 55% head wind against us and it all comes back to us in the fourth quarter. I explained in my letter what happened and Dave tells me most companies actually account for it, they would capitalize it. We may revisit it and Dave may have an opinion on that.  David Chidester, Overstock.com - SVP, Finance  We'll definitely revisit that. Most people expense it as you sell the inventory. It makes for a nice flatter movement in your margins.  Dr. Patrick Byrne, Overstock.com - Chairman and President  So we expense it not as we sell it, but as we take it in. And that means that we get some noise both directions in our margins. Anyway, still all that said, we are a little bit slower than I thought we would be in the infrastructure, the logistics improvements that should be adding 20, 30, 40 basis points a quarter. But they are ticking in. They just took eight to ten weeks longer to implement than I’d expected.  Slide 6, what we like is to see the green line diverge from the red line. We can grow the red line as much as we want as long the green line is much higher. They have diverged. They have now converged. And that's really -- that's the stair stepping. When you reach the stair step, it's hard to keep them apart.  Slide 7 -- I'm having trouble. Slide 7 is not coming up for me. There it goes. Gross profit per transaction. This is nice. Up 44% versus last year at almost $14.  Slide 8, quarterly net margins, minus 1.7. That's the best it's been in any non-Q4 quarter. Other than -- well at least in the last few years. I think in Q2 it was a little bit better.  Next slide, slide 9. There's a delay. Unique visitors were up 62%. 62% growth underlying 72% quarterly growth. Revenue growth. Unique customers, 61% growth. New customers, 45%. So we're only having 45% more new customers, but again, the 72% growth. Year-over-year growth in customers up to almost 7 million customers, that's 81%. That's a pretty good analog with the overall growth in the last four quarters. Customer orders, 55%. Again, so to get 72% growth, we've got to be getting more per order.  Gender, few slides about our visitor demographics. Our visitor demographics where the Internet is 51% female, we're 56% female. I said in the past that our customer demographics are 66% female. Our visitor demographics are 56% female. Draw your own conclusions from that. Household income, slide 15, we have a nice, sort of it seems to me a middle class, upper mid class base visitors. Education.  Slide 17, there's a couple of things I want to correct. I have got to correct two things that I have given you in previous phone calls. One, is better than it was in the past and one is worse than it was.  The one that's worse is this: At the end of the the fourth quarter in the January conference call I said I thought we had done $10 million of GMV, gross merchandise value in our auctions in the fourth quarter. That was a mistake. I know exactly where I got the information, I know exactly who I asked and I was given the wrong information. I'm not sure if there was cross talk between us or our reporting since the auctions was so fresh. Our reporting with auctions wasn't very good. Fortunately on a GAAP basis it's a very immaterial difference. The truth is in our fourth quarter, it turns out we did 7.1 million of auction gmv, dropped in the first quarter, and has come back in the second quarter. I still have hopes -- the loss has contracted from 1.6 million, to 1.2 million. I want to see this under a million this quarter. By as quickly as possible not having any quarterly loss. Not costing us anything to keep auctions going.  Then some good news. Things that are a little bit better than I've reported in the past. In the past we've been reporting this CPA, and cost for acquisition, and we showed you a bar that was broken near the top, and said this is for shopping only and this is it if you add auctions. We were actually adding the cost of auction marketing to the numerator, but we were adding nothing to the denominator. We were not adding any of the acquisitions in auctions. So the whole thing got -- the whole thing was kind of meaningless.  What we decided to do is break it out between shopping and auctions. Shopping has seen this 39% increase in the CPA. Something else is going on. If you look at the red line here, you see that the marketing expense as a percentage of revenue fell. It was down to the 6% to 8%. Came up to 10% last quarter. Then it fell half a point this quarter, or more. That's really the key number for us, is the percentage of revenue that we spend on marketing.  Now what’s  happening that may seem paradoxical is the cost of acquisitions is going up, although that percentage spent on marketing came down a little bit. The reason is there's less new customers within our traffic -- within the traffic stream that you get from online advertising. That may have to do with things going on on the Internet, it may have to do with where we're advertising. I know it has to do with that. That's kind of an interesting paradox. If you would asked us two years ago we would have said you would never have seen that happen, but now we see it happen. And we understand it.  We're going to continue splitting up auctions and shopping from now on. If you go to the auction CPA, you see this is the CPA for auctions. Actually if we had combined them appropriately and added the costs together and added the acquisitions, we would have gotten a lower number than the 22 or whatever. Not a higher number.  Okay. Repeat revenue analysis. My first comment is, let's stop the madness. I've given you different ways of calculating it, and I keep on trying to explain it, and each time I try to explain it, I probably made matters worse and people get confused and they write about it as if I mean one thing when I mean another. What I've decided to do is take a couple of minutes and really carefully explain this. And then I won't have to do it again. I'll just give you the results from now on.  The first way we reported this ran like this. Calculate the repeat revenue for any quarter as being equal to the revenue in that quarter generated by non-first time invoices divided by the total revenue for the quarter. Well, the result of that is, each customer in at that calculation, each customer from inception is included, including customers that purchase twice in the current quarter. The problem with that is that if a new customer comes in in the quarter and purchases once and then purchases again, that second purchase counts as a non-first time invoice, and introduces noise into what you're trying to measure, which is really how the customer base that pre-existed, that predated the quarter, how they behaved. So that was version one. We gave that to you for a year, year and a half.  Then I think we did version two for a quarter, which is to say, only count the existing customers before a quarter starts in the calculation. The calculation would be the same as the version one, except it would exclude all customers from the current quarter, all new customers from the current quarter. Well, that's -- that has problems, too. One is it's affected by growth. Your growth -- your growth rate introduces noise in the math, as well as the problem is as time goes on and the tail gets longer it creates a built in inflation. There's a longer tail from which you can draw your customers to buy in the current quarter, so you get a built inflation.  However, look  at those two ways, version one and version two, version one is the number we reported for quite a while. It dipped a little bit. It's come back up to 59.3. Version two is now 50.5. They've both done well. But as I say, I don't think those are the right ways to report it.  Now I tried to report it the right way the last time and I think I caused more confusion than I should have. Again, I'm walking through this so carefully this time in hope that in the future people can refer to this slide deck if they need an explanation.  Okay. The right way is to take a bracket, a period of 12 months and look at all the active people in that period and say, everybody who was active in that 12 month period, how did they behave over the following 12 months? So for every $100 they spent within the blue bracket period, how much did they spend within the green bracket period? As time goes on, these two brackets can slide to the right. That's a good measure of your churn, loyalty, et cetera.  On that number, this is what's happened over time. And in turns out that this is the -- now that we're not just trying to figure all this out for ourselves, but we actually have hired a bunch of pros, this turns out to be one of the major ways people measure churn and loyalty. That shows nice progress in the high 20s up to 54, over the three years that we didn't even know -- we weren't even measuring this. We weren't even -- we weren't even looking at it. To me, the gain that we've seen so far is mostly a function of, it's a reflection of the fact that we were answering the phones right and shipping on time and satisfying people and they were just getting more and more loyal. We weren't doing  anything to manage to this number.  Now I'm going to dive into that in more detail, going through this quickly, breaking it up not by quarters, but by weeks. I've been asked these questions so many times, over the last three years, I'm happy to finally  give you information.  Our new customer repeat rate; someone who buys in week one, how did they do in the weeks 2 to 53? We're up to about 40% repeat. Average repeat orders per customer is a little over two -- a little over one. The average repeat orders per customer who repeats is 2.5.  Again, I'm sort of glossing over all the improvements that have been made in this, and I think that those improvements mostly reflect not that we've become -- that we became over the last two years terrific in CRM. We didn't even know what it stood for. We became better and better at shipping on time and things like.  Average repeat revenue per customer, and you see it went up and then it dropped and came back up. I think that dip came from when we introduced BMV and starting getting into BMV because those orders are about a third of the size. Those customers turned out to be pretty loyal, but the order quantities are smaller. Now it's climbing back up to where it was pre-BMV.  Average repeat revenue per -- and this is key -- average repeat revenue per -- sorry, my slide's not loading. Per repeat customer. Of the people who repeat, they come back and buy at this point $250 to $300 after their first purchase within the first year. So this will present - to people who are familiar with CRM, you see the opportunities here. On the one hand I think these graphs show something good. We've gotten better and better with loyalty, even without focus on loyalty. Now that we're able to look at this data, it really suggests some powerful techniques we can apply to improve. Okay.  What did we spend $35 million of your money on in IT buildout? I'm going to be a little bit technical here. I think there are tech investors on the phone that might be interested in what's going on.  One is, the key players in the service space are Dell and IBM. You can think of this as a totem pole. And Dell, of course, started off in desktops, and home computers and laptops, and got into servers, and has gotten better and better with servers with one, two, 4 CPUs.  IBM has done something very smart. By the way, these guys are both partners of ours, so I don't want to say anything that offends either side, and they have been unbelievable partners. We get their scientists and engineers helping us. I'm trying to call this as we see it and explain what we have built using their technology.  IBM has done something very smart, and that's pushing back up the totem pole by taking technology that's been around on their main frames for many years and putting it on their servers. That's this whole P5 series you see advertised. It's fantastic. And there's -- I think actually boxes that take 4 to 16 CPUs and 16 to 64. I think there's actually boxes that take 1 to 4.  What we decided was the natural break was between -- was to break at the 4 CPU per box level, giving those to Dell and bigger boxes taking -- like the data base servers going with IBM. So the web and application servers would be Dell and the data servers IBM.  So using those, that technology, we've created this kind of a module. This module is a bunch of Dell blade servers that are typically in our case customer-facing, and they're clustered. They're wired to IBM P 570s which are the boxes in the 4 to 16 proc range and storage solutions from EMC. That -- we did extensive testing, on one side's technology against the other, and this looked like the natural break. And what I find so attractive about this is it gives us a very natural path to scalability.  First of all, you can scale across the Dells, - which are very inexpensive as time goes on -, and the IBM P570s can be scaled in three directions. They can be scaled horizontally You can cluster more and more of them next to each other. You can put more procs in the box. We have four in ours. You can take them up to 16. And ultimately, if we were many times our current size, you can replace these with the P590s, 16 to 64.  Now, why that's so -- and this front line, as we see it, this is sort of -- this place where we've divided between Dell and IBM is kind of the front line of technology, the technology battle, and Dell is doing something clever. I don't mean to slag their -- they've come up with a technology called Infiniband, that I think is going to be introduced in December, that will help them push down from the four proc box into the 16 proc box.  But IBM's got -- I had never worked with IBM. I had no idea how good they are as engineers.  So this is the basic module that we're now built around. How that plays out is one of these modules, one of these clusters of clusters, really, under our shopping, our BMV tab, our auctions, our travel, maybe something new in the future, and that's our web store tier.  Then you have a back office tier, which is Oracle financials, Oracle customer hub and a click tracking system, for clickstream analysis of tracking. I'll get to where we are actually in all these implementations in just a moment.  After the back office tier there's the distribution, the logistics. Salt Lake, and Indiana warehouses, and the hundreds of warehouses of our partners are all tied into Oracle.  This is all tied together with Golden Gate, which is the ETL I described in my letter. There's just a massive amount of data that has to be shifted around among these systems. It's all tied together with Golden Gate which then in fact ties it into Teradata, which is really the best in class data warehouse, feeds through Business Objects to Overstock users.  This is what we've spent 35 million on, this and the Oracle site license that underlines that we can use as many Oracle -- We have infinite Oracle licenses for databasing.  Where we are, is the web store tier is done, the back office tier, Oracle finance is being turned on next weekend. It's shifted now 14 days from where we hoped. The click -- but they're banging on it in the final stages of testing. In fact, they're telling me they may consider turning it on this weekend, but that's a major -- that's a heart and lung transplant we've undergone. The click tracking system is live. Came on two or three weeks ago. Teradata came live, also in mid July, along with Business Objects.  Customer Hub is the only piece that we're putting out in the fourth quarter, or into the new year.  This may -- I don't know how this sounds to you, but I can say compared to what we had, what we basically had was under shopping an HP N-class box that was doing all of this, and it literally meant that at times we could do no analytics. Ever. We had very limited reporting. Our click tracking, we would actual turn off when traffic got high in the day. We had this one two or three hundred thousand dollar box. Then we built up things around it and this has been a nine-month process.  But this is the architecture and we're putting the finishing touches on it now, and it's cost us $35 million. But I think it has been brilliant, I think our CIO, Shawn Schwegman, has done -  is the best CIO in America. I think he's done a fantastic job over two years taking us from really a rinky dink arrangement into this architecture. And what's beautiful about it is not only heavy duty, it's so scalable. It's scalable at each layer.  Okay, well that may be more than you wanted to know about technology, but I will mention this: The kinds of numbers, for three years folks have been asking me things about customer repeat rate, and all I could give was the version one, which was very superficial. Not even a good way to measure it. And even calculating that number was weeks of someone's time, dumping things into Excel and twisting and sorting and all this kind of stuff. To give you the kind of numbers we're showing you now, like version three, and those five weekly scatter graphs that I showed you, that's all practically push button. For the first time, we're able to get this-  an unbelievable look into our customer base and all this data. But it took a massive investment to get there.  Okay. Next slide. SkiWest acquisition. $25 million in cash. $5 million to $6 million what we think the first year's operating income will be. I'm sure people have questions about this. It will have some effect on our business this year. But people will have questions I'm sure.  Stock buy back program. We spent just short of $92 million, got a 1.7 million shares back, 8% of the shares outstanding. So we had 19.9. We bought back 1.7 million. Dropped back to 18.2. The reason that didn't -- We also had I think 300,000 of warrants of mine from the early days the company came due. I think we're back up to 18.7 in shares outstanding. We retired 33 million in debt, paying 28 million for it. We have 8 million remaining on the stock buyback program.  Now I'm going to go into one last issue, and that is, I want to talk about the short position. Before anybody freaks out, I'm not doing this, I've got no grudge against the shorts, contrary to popular belief, no grudge against the shorts. I'm not trying to do this -- I feel like, as odd as it may sound, I feel like I have a fiduciary duty to the shorts just like I do to the longs. I think it's important to put this information out there from a fiduciary duty and people make up their own minds about what they want to do about it.  So here is slide 47. Here's the short interest in our company over the last year. Got up to 7 million by June 15th. No complaints. Not saying anything wrong with that. More power to them.  Next slide. How much volume was there on any given day. The system is slow. The shareholder.com web cast. I hope it's not as slow for all of you as it is for me. What the volume chart shows is that the volume has come down -- well, mine is hung up. I don't know about anyone else's. Well, I guess we're just going to break off there. And if this ever comes back to life I'll bring it back up. Operator, why don't we go ahead and turn to questions?  "
"21","","Q4","2005","    Operator  Good morning, everyone. We’re pleased you’re joining us today to    discuss Nike’s fiscal 2005 fourth quarter results. For those of you who    need to reference our release, you’ll find it on our website, www.nikebiz.com.    You’ll also find expanded information on the website about some of the    highlights we’ll be discussing today. Participants in today’s call are    Don Blair, our Chief Financial Officer and Pamela Catlett, our Vice    President of Investor Relations. Each of today’s participants will    provide brief prepared remarks, which will also be available on our    website immediately following the call.  Before I turn it over to Pam, let me remind you that on this call we’re going to make forward-looking statements based on our current expectations, and those statements are subject to certain risks and    uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially.    These risks and uncertainties are detailed in the reports we file with    the SEC, including Forms 8-K and 10-Q. Some forward-looking statements    concern futures orders that are not necessarily indicative of total    revenues for subsequent periods due to cancellations and the mix of    futures and at-once orders, which may vary significantly from quarter    to quarter. In addition, it’s important to remember a significant    portion of our business including equipment, most of Nike Retail, Nike    Golf, Converse, Cole Haan, Bauer, Hurley and Exeter Brands Group are    not included in these futures numbers.  Finally, during this conference call we may discuss non-GAAP    financial measures. A presentation of comparable GAAP measures and    quantitative reconciliations can also be found at Nike’s website. In    this call we may also discuss non-public financial and statistical    information, which is also publicly available on that site,    www.nikebiz.com.  Now here’s Pam.  PAMELA CATLETT   Vice President of Investor Relations  Good morning everyone. We’re pleased you’re joining us this morning    to discuss Nike’s fiscal 2005 fourth quarter and full year results. We    issued our results about an hour ago and for those of you who need to    reference our press release, you’ll find it on our website www.nikebiz.com.    Like past quarters, Nike Chief Financial Officer Don Blair will cover    the results contained in our press release in his prepared remarks.  We’re doing things a bit differently today. As you know, tomorrow    we are hosting our annual investor meeting with members of Nike’s    management team. Consequently, Don and I will manage today’s call with    his prepared remarks followed by your questions. We’ve given the other    usual participants a hall pass for the day, but you’ll certainly hear    from Bill Perez, Mark Parker, Charlie Denson and other members of our    team tomorrow. We’ll also try not to steal any of their thunder today.  Now I’ll turn it over to Don.  DON BLAIR   Vice President & Chief Financial Officer  Thanks Pam.  You know we often speak about Nike as a portfolio of businesses,    and how that portfolio helps us deliver more consistent growth. This    past year, each of our Nike Brand product lines – Footwear, Apparel and    Equipment – in each of our geographic regions – USA, Europe, Asia and    the Americas - delivered higher revenue and gross profit. As a group,    our Other businesses also delivered outstanding revenue and profit    growth. As a result, we’re here today to talk about another record year    for the Company in fiscal 2005.   For the full year, revenues grew 12% to $13.7 billion.  Revenues for the fourth quarter grew 7%. Changes in foreign currency  exchange rates accounted for about 3 points of growth, for the quarter  and the year. Recent acquisitions added over a point of growth this  year, due largely to the comparison of a full year of results for  Converse this year versus a partial year in fiscal 2004.    The Nike Brand continued to show strength as futures orders  for the next 6 months grew 9.5% in real dollar terms. Excluding the  impact of currency changes, futures orders increased 8.3%. Both figures  are consistent with the futures growth we reported last quarter.    We also delivered record profits, as our full year diluted  earnings per share were $4.48, up 28% versus fiscal 2004. Fourth  quarter diluted earnings per share increased 15% to $1.30.    For the year, our consolidated gross margin was 44.5%, up 160 basis points versus fiscal 2004 and the highest in our history.   Our international regions accounted for just over half the    improvement in the consolidated gross margin percentage, as positive    currency changes were partially offset by the impact of higher closeout    sales and strategies to improve product value in Europe and Asia.    Overall, the gross impact of currency movements contributed 170 basis    points to the consolidated gross margin increase.  For the fourth quarter, gross margins advanced 140 basis points to 45.2%.   SG&A grew 10% and 14% for the quarter and the year,  respectively. Stronger foreign currencies drove about 3 percentage  points of growth in each case. Our trailing twelve  month Return on Invested Capital was 23.2%, up 150 basis points versus  last year. Over the last five years, we’ve added over 9 points to  Nike’s ROIC. Nevertheless, we still believe there are opportunities to  further improve our capital productivity.    For the year, we generated $1.3 billion of Free Cash Flow  from Operations. And we delivered a significant amount of that cash to  our shareholders, as we paid out $237 million in dividends and  repurchased $556 million of stock. I should note that since Return on  Invested Capital and Free Cash Flow from Operations are non-GAAP terms,  we’ve posted the definitions and calculations on our website.   So overall, fiscal 2005 was a year for our record books. Now let’s dig into some of the details.  We’ll start with our European Region,    which includes the Middle East and Africa. All of you know that Europe    has been a challenging business environment for many companies over the    last year. We’re pleased that despite the difficult macro environment,    our European Region had a very good year in fiscal 2005. Revenues grew    12%, including about 7 points of growth from changes in foreign    currency exchange rates. Excluding currency impacts, Footwear and    Apparel revenues each grew 5% for the year, while Equipment revenues    advanced 2%.  For the fourth quarter, European revenues grew 4%, including 7    points of growth from currency exchange rate changes. Excluding    currency changes, European Footwear revenues advanced 3%. Apparel    revenues declined 10% and Equipment revenues fell 8% in comparison to    very strong results in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2004. In last    year’s fourth quarter, constant dollar Apparel revenues grew 17%    year-over-year and Equipment revenues increased 26%, both fueled by    marketing activity in advance of the European Football Championships,    the Tour de France and the Athens Olympics.  For the year, the most significant constant dollar revenue growth    came from our Central Europe, Middle East, Africa unit, driven by    strong growth in Eastern Europe, Turkey and Russia. The UK and Italy    also posted strong growth for the year, offsetting weakness in the    balance of Western Europe. Sales through Nike-owned retail stores grew    strongly, reflecting higher comp store sales and the addition of new    retail stores in the region.  Our gross margins in Europe expanded 290 basis points for the year,    accounting for 90 basis points of our consolidated gross margin    improvement. Improved foreign exchange rates were the main driver of    gross margin improvement in Europe, partially offset by lower product    margins and increased sales of Footwear and Apparel closeouts.  Overall, fiscal 2005 pretax income for the European region was $918    million, an increase of 23% versus fiscal 2004. For those of you    keeping score, that’s $174 million of incremental profits.  In the Asia Region, revenues increased    19% for the quarter and 18% for the year. About 3 points of the    increase for the quarter and 4 points of the increase for the year came    from stronger currencies in the region. Excluding currency effects,    Footwear reported 9% growth, while Apparel grew 19% and Equipment    advanced 20% for the year.  For the year, constant dollar revenues advanced in every country in    the region except Australia / New Zealand. China led the way: our    business in that country nearly doubled as we added over 500 doors and    same store sales grew strongly. In Japan, constant dollar revenues were    higher for the year, but the market there remains challenging and    overall constant dollar revenues fell slightly in the fourth quarter.    Over the next several seasons, we’ll be launching some new, innovative    products that we’re confident will help re-establish our value    proposition in this key market.  For the year, Asia gross margins fell 30 basis points as gross    margin investments to improve consumer value and higher, less    profitable closeout sales more than offset a modest benefit from more    favorable currency exchange rates. Asia had a minimal impact on the    change in Nike Inc.’s consolidated gross margin percentage.  Reported fiscal 2005 pretax income for the Asia Region grew 13% to $400 million.  Our Americas Region delivered an    excellent year in fiscal 2005, reporting $118 million of pretax income,    up 21% versus the prior year. Reported revenues grew 15% for the year,    with 1 point of growth coming from stronger currencies in the region.    In the fourth quarter, revenues advanced 20% including 6 points of    growth from currency. Revenues in Central and South America grew over    30% during the year, while Mexico also posted higher sales. Canada had    a challenging year with weaker sales in both Apparel and Footwear.  Gross margins in the Americas Region grew 120 basis points for the    year, increasing Nike Inc.’s consolidated gross margin percentage by    about a tenth of a point. Discount reductions, lower closeout sales and    favorable foreign exchange rates drove the increased profitability.  In the past, many people have thought of the US as a “mature    market”. Fortunately for our shareholders, the management team in our US Region    never got the news. Fiscal 2005 was a tremendous year for Nike in the    USA. Revenues for the year grew over 7% and pretax income grew 12% to    over $1.1 billion. For the year, revenue growth was broad-based, as    most key accounts advanced strongly. Nike Retail also posted a strong    year; comp store sales in Niketowns increased 11% in the fourth quarter    and 10% for the year, demonstrating continued brand heat at retail.  For the fourth quarter, US revenue grew 3%, as continued strong    growth of Footwear and Equipment more than offset lower Apparel sales.  Footwear revenue for the US Region grew 9% for the year and 7% for    the fourth quarter, driven by growth in both units and average price    per pair. Higher unit sales of sport performance models continued to    power the increase in average price per pair.  Apparel sales in the US grew 2% for the year, as high single-digit    growth in Branded Apparel more than offset declines in Licensed    Apparel, due to the expiration of our NBA license. For the quarter,    Apparel sales in the US fell 7% due to changes in the timing of    shipments, the decline in sales of Licensed Apparel and lower at-once    orders.  Gross margins in the US advanced 80 basis points for the year,    driving 30 basis points of our consolidated gross margin improvement.    The majority of the improvement was due to tight management of our    Footwear supply chain, which resulted in fewer, more profitable    closeout sales.  For the full year, revenues from our Other businesses grew 22% to    $1.7 billion. Converse and Starter accounted for about 12 points of the    full year growth of our Other businesses. On a comparable, full year    basis, we estimate that Converse revenues grew 11% year-over-year.  At Cole Haan, revenues advanced 19% for the year, reflecting new    Cole Haan retail doors, high single-digit same store sales growth and    strong growth with wholesale accounts. Revenues for Nike Golf and    Hurley grew at high single-digit rates, while sales at Bauer Nike    Hockey fell slightly, reflecting the difficult hockey market. For the    year, our Other businesses earned $154 million of pretax profit, driven    by the acquisition of Converse and Starter, as well as better    profitability at Cole Haan and Bauer Nike Hockey.  Consolidated SG&A spending for Nike Inc. grew 10% in the fourth    quarter and 14% for the full year. Changes in exchange rates accounted    for about 3 points of the increase for both the quarter and the year.    The comparison to a partial fiscal 2004 for Converse and the    acquisition of Starter accounted for an additional point of increase    for the full year.  For the year, demand creation spending increased 16%, with 3 points    of growth due to the effect of stronger foreign currencies and about 2    points due to the annualization of Converse and the acquisition of    Starter. Incremental investments around the world in retail marketing,    advertising and athlete endorsements were key drivers of the balance of    the increase. As expected, fourth quarter demand creation growth was    modest since much of our spending for the year was focused on global    sporting events in the summer of 2004.  Operating overhead increased 13% for the full year. Stronger    foreign currencies accounted for about 3 points of growth, while the    annualization of Converse and the acquisition of Starter added a point.    Key components of the increase for the year were higher personnel costs    and investments in emerging markets, product development and our    non-Nike branded businesses. Higher reserves for bad debts also    increased expenses for the fourth quarter.  Net Interest Expense for the year was $5 million, $20 million lower    than the prior year as our strong cash flow and more efficient use of    global cash increased interest income.  Other expense for the year was $29 million, down $46 million versus    the prior year. Foreign currency conversion losses, largely from    Europe, accounted for most of this year's expense and lower foreign    currency losses accounted for the majority of the year-over-year    decrease. These losses were offset by favorable translation of    foreign-currency denominated profits, reported by our international    regions. The combined impact of earnings improvement from lower foreign    currency conversion losses and the favorable translation of foreign    currency-denominated profits was $95 million of additional pre-tax    income for the year and $36 million for the fourth quarter.  Our effective tax rate for the year was 34.9%, slightly higher than    last year’s 34.8% rate. In the fourth quarter, we made provision to    repatriate $500 million of foreign earnings under the American Jobs    Creation Act. As you know, this Act permits companies to repatriate    foreign earnings at a reduced tax rate. We elected to repatriate a mix    of earnings for which US taxes had previously been provided and    earnings that had been designated as permanently reinvested. As a    result, our intention to repatriate foreign earnings under the Act did    not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal 2005.    While our future effective tax rate may benefit from repatriation of    foreign earnings under the Act, there are many variables that drive our    effective tax rate from year to year. As a result, we are not at this    point changing our expected effective tax rate from the 35% level we’ve    communicated previously.  Our balance sheet continues to be an area of financial strength for    the Company and we’re pleased that Standard & Poor’s have noticed;    they recently upgraded our long-term debt rating to A+. Cash and    short-term investments totaled $1.8 billion at the end of the year, a    billion dollars greater than our interest bearing debt as of the same    date.  As of May 31, worldwide inventories were almost 10% higher than a    year ago, essentially in line with the growth in futures orders for the    next six months. Currency changes accounted for about 4 points of    growth; later timing of Fall shipments in the US and Europe was also a    key driver of the growth in inventory.  At the end of the year, accounts receivable were 7% higher than the    prior year, in line with our fourth quarter revenue growth. Stronger    foreign currencies accounted for about 5 points of the growth in    accounts receivable.  Our expectations for fiscal 2006 remain consistent with the point of view we discussed last quarter.  We’re currently targeting high-single digit revenue growth for the    year. First quarter revenue growth should be towards the low end of    that 7 to 9% range. We also expect higher gross margins, driven by    better foreign exchange hedge rates and a tighter supply chain,    partially offset by higher commodity costs, discounts and investments    in product value in Europe and Asia. The highest year-over-year growth    in gross margins should be in the first quarter.  Finally, we’re targeting SG&A as a lower percentage of revenue    in fiscal 2006 than in fiscal 2005, as Demand Creation grows    essentially in line with revenue and we leverage the investments we’ve    made in Operating Overhead. Relative to fiscal 2005, demand creation    spending will be more concentrated in the last three quarters of the    year. Last year’s spending was particularly heavy in the first quarter,    as we invested behind the Summer of Sport. This year’s spending will be    focused on the buildup to the 2006 Soccer World Cup in the summer of    2006.  On the other hand, we expect greater Operating Overhead leverage in    the second half as we anniversary the growth in costs over the course    of fiscal 2005. As a result, we expect the greatest overall SG&A    leverage to fall in the first and fourth quarters.  Fiscal 2005 was a terrific year and we’re really looking forward to another strong year for the Nike portfolio in fiscal 2006.  With that, we’d be happy to take your questions.  "
"2159","SOHU","Q1","2005","    Sohu.com (ticker: SOHU) announced Q1 2005 earnings earlier this week. In a filing today, SOHU provided management's prepared remarks from its Q1 earnings results conference call. The company also made a point about forward guidance that was discussed in the Q&A portion of the call:SOHU.COMFIRST QUARTER 2005 EARNINGS REPORTCONFERENCE CALLCaroline Straathof, Director Investor RelationsThank you for joining Sohu.com to discuss our First Quarter 2005 Results.

Forward-looking statements involve inherent risks and uncertainties. We caution you that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in any forward-looking statement.Potential risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, Sohu’s historical and possible future losses, limited operating history, uncertain regulatory landscape in the People’s Republic of China, fluctuations in quarterly operating results, and the company’s reliance on online advertising sales, mobile phone related wireless revenue, online game and e-commerce for its revenues. Further information regarding these and other risks is included in Sohu’s Annual Report on Form 10-K and other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.Thank you for your patience. Now, let me turn the call to Charles Zhang, Chairman of the board and CEO,Charles Zhang:Thank you all for being on our conference call today.We are pleased to report these first quarter results that reflect how we were able to meet or exceed our own expectations for this quarter. Our first quarter revenues of US$23.7 million came in above company guidance. Our advertising revenues, which include brand advertising and sponsored search, were at the high end of our expectations despite strong seasonality of the Chinese New Year holidays. Our game operations are on track, with Q1 revenues in line with company expectations. And we are particularly pleased to note that wireless business has turned the corner with quarterly sequential revenue at $6.0 million, well above our expectations. We believe that we have left last year’s transitional and regulatory issues behind us. As a result, we expect that SOHU’s first quarter results put us on firm footing for a good business year.Let me discuss the progress of our business this quarter in more detail.First, advertising revenues.Our advertising revenue of US$14.86 million met the high end of company guidance. These are solid first quarter results from which we can now move into the traditional high season for advertising in Q2 and Q3. Therefore we can reaffirm our full year guidance of 30% year-over-year growth in advertising revenues for 2005.In our brand advertising we continue to see strong contributions from advertisers in the dotcom sector, financial services, fast moving consumer goods, as well as real estate advertising.In sponsored search, I am happy to report that we launched our search engine SoGou version 2.0 during the first quarter, which is a significant technical upgrade of the first version that we launched in August last year. Sogou’s traffic has already shown some initial uptake from the upgrade in the first quarter with traffic that is double the Q4 level. As we explained before, our key objective for this year is to grow our search traffic, so that we build up a solid basis from which to monetize our search engine.Even so, I am pleased to see that client spending on our Sponsored Search has strongly picked up again after the Chinese New Year. Therefore we expect quarter-on-quarter growth in Sponsored Search of 15%, growing faster than our brand advertising.Our longer-term aim is to make SoGou the #1 search engine for Chinese language search in terms of technology, product and usage. A key component of our drive to grow traffic is our effort to build the largest web page database in the Chinese language. Currently our indexed web pages in the search engine stand at 800 million pages, and we expect our database to surpass one billion pages within weeks.We expect our long-term prospects in online search to be further strengthened with our acquisition of Go2Map, an online mapping service provider. This seven-year old company is the dominant player in mapping technology in China. Through this acquisition, which we expect to close soon, we aim to quickly establish a market position in mapping solutions for the most than 100 million Internet users who go online to find city destinations such as government offices, restaurants and hotels, and bus line information. We believe the acquisition will enhance our overall competitive strength as a portal and search engine.Turning to our other business lines, our non-advertising revenue of US$8.87 million exceeded company guidance because of a stronger than expected recovery in our wireless business.Let me now briefly go over each of our non-advertising business lines: wireless business, online games, and e-commerce.We finally turned the corner in the first quarter in our wireless business, which returned to quarterly sequential growth for the first time after 5 quarters of sequential decline. Each of our wireless business segments recorded growth, with SMS and WAP now providing the bulk of our wireless value-added services.We are also pleased to note that our acquisition of Goodfeel, the WAP company we acquired last year, has started to pay off. The fully integrated SOHU-Goodfeel WAP team is taking full advantage of Chinese consumers’ increasing acceptance of WAP services.We had an inline quarter for online games, with our two multi-player games Blade online and Knight online performing as expected. We are committed to online games for the long term and we are encouraged by this incremental progress. We are preparing to launch a casual game portal in the second half of this year. These games will not be revenue generating for now, but will enhance our overall portal entertainment offerings and lengthen the amount of time our users spend online with us.Finally, a few words on e-commerce. Our e-commerce operation was affected by seasonality as well this past quarter. Our order intake is traditionally strong in the weeks leading up to Chinese New Year holidays. But just as with the Christmas holidays in other countries, customers do not shop much during and shortly after the holidays. We strongly believe in the long-term opportunity for e-commerce in China.I’d like to make one final point before we move to the financial presentation. I have noticed that there is some confusion about my ownership holdings of Sohu. Let me clarify that here. I own 9.5 million shares, which is 26.1% of the company. I increased my holdings in the past year by 2%.The bulk of these shares is held by the Photon Group, of which I am the sole owner. I transferred shares to Photon last year for personal planning purposes. My ownership furthermore includes 1.2 million shares subject to a 3-year variable prepaid forward sales contract signed in August 2003. You can find more details about my ownership of Sohu in the SEC filings.Now I would like to give the floor to our CFO, Carol Yu, for a financial review.Carol Yu:Thank you Charles. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss some key points of our first quarter results to enhance your understanding of our business operations.I. RevenuesWe are pleased to report that revenues of $23.73 million for the first quarter exceeded our guidance.With advertising revenue of $14.86 million we experienced a seasonal decline of 6% quarter-on-quarter, which was less severe than expected. Our sponsored search grew slightly, by 1%, over the previous quarter despite the negative impact of Chinese New Year. We believe we are still on the right track to reach our full year target of 30% growth for the entire advertising business.We are very pleased to note that our wireless business is back on a growth track. Let me give you a breakdown:Our SMS services grew 21% quarter-on quarter to US$ 3.3 million.Our WAP services grew 38% to US$ 2.1 million, because our strong WAP team is tapping into growing popularity of WAP services, as Charles mentioned earlier.Our IVR business grew 13% to 470 thousand dollar.Our MMS and RingBackTone services contribute only very small amounts.Going forward we believe that we will continue to see a cautious recovery in our wireless business.II. Turning to our gross margin:Overall gross margin of 68% was unchanged from the previous two quarters. Our advertising gross margin in Q1 at 76% was 4 basis points lower than in Q4 due to our seasonal sequential decline in sales.Our non-advertising gross margin in Q1 was up to 55% from 45% in Q4. This was due to the resumption in growth of relatively high margin wireless products, especially WAP products.III. Operating expensesTotal spending, which consists of operating expenses plus the cost of revenue for advertising amounted to $14.3 million in Q1, as compared to $13.6 million in the fourth quarter. Our professional fees were nearly $1 million lower than in Q4, when we incurred in a first-time one-time cost of professional fees in relation to our SO 404 project. At the same time, we incurred cost increases in Q1 for commissions, extra headcount and benefits, as well as increases in amortization and facilities related to our recent office relocation and a one-time write-off for leasehold improvements. These all together more than offset the reduction in professional fees.IV. Operating Profit MarginOperating profit margin in the first quarter was 23%, compared to 25% in the fourth quarter. We are still in the build-up phase of a very promising but competitive market, therefore we need to continue to invest in the future growth of the company.V. Balance Sheet.Let me now make a few comments on the Balance Sheet.Our DSO for Q1 is 79 days, compared to 74 days in Q4. Advertising DSO is 93 days, up slightly from 92 days in Q4. Our March 31 net accounts receivable balance was $19.1 million, compared to $19.9 million in Q4, including $12.3 million related to our advertising business and $ 5.9 million for our wireless business.Our bad debts provision for our advertising business as of March 31 2005 amounted to $1.7 million, an increase of $750 thousand compared to the provision as of December 31, 2004. While we consider this level of bad debt provision to be still relatively low as compared to our level of advertising sales, we pay particular attention to continue to be prudent in our credit extension policy.As in the past, we had regular collections from our mobile operators. I would like you to reassure you that we have never had a bad debt from a mobile operator.VI. And finally, the Business OutlookYou will find detailed guidance for the second quarter in our earnings release. Let me explain a few key points regarding our guidance.We are moving into the high season for online advertising. The second and third quarter of the year is traditionally the period in which marketers allocate the bulk of their advertising budget. As Charles mentioned we expect sponsored search to grow by 15% in Q2.On the expenses side, let me remind you of what we said in our last call: We have budgeted for Q2 a total of $800 thousand dollar for additional amortization, extra employee benefits and additional rent over 2004 levels. This is greater than the $500 thousand dollar we incrementally incurred in the first quarter, because we moved office in early February 2005. The annualized additional expenses related to the new office total $3.2 million dollar in 2005.Before we start the Q&A let me summarize the key points underlying our confidence in SOHU’s long term future.Our dominant position in online advertising will continue to pay off given that the dynamic online advertising market in China is still in an early growth stage.And the paid search market offers us another tremendous long-term growth opportunity because SOHU is an early player with proprietary technology in this market.That concludes my presentation. Thank you for your attention and now I would like to open the floor for questions. Operator?GUIDANCE:During the question and answer portion of the call, the registrant’s management team disclosed that the high end of the registrant’s guidance for non-advertising revenue of US$ 9.0 million consists of US$ 6.5 million from wireless revenue, US$ 1.0 million from online games revenue and US$ 1.5 million from e-commerce revenue. Management further disclosed that it had 88,000 retail clients for its paid search service, up from 84,000 retail clients in the fourth quarter of 2004. Management further disclosed that it expects the registrant’s 2.5 Generation wireless value-added services, which contributed one-third of the registrant’s total wireless revenues in the first quarter of 2005, to contribute half of its total wireless revenues in the fourth quarter of 2005.
