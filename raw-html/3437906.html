<p>I will now turn the call over to Peter. Peter?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, all. Thanks for joining the call. We're pleased with our second quarter results and with the measurable positive progress we continue making on our strategic objectives. In every part of our business, from Broadcast TV to WGN America to Gracenote, out strategies are delivering results and we're meeting our operating goals.</p>
<p>But before I more deeply dive into our results for Q2, I do want to take a moment to talk about all the recent noise in the media environment because we are growing and we're thriving in spite of all of it. We're confident that our commitment to providing great value to our audiences, advertisers and affiliates, gives us a competitive advantage and insulates us from many of the issues impacting our competitors. Moreover, our long-term strategies will enable us to sustain profitable growth, notwithstanding the rapid changes taking place in the media landscape.</p>
<p>In our Broadcast business, for example, we're growing revenue and building market share in a flattish core advertising market by emphasizing local news, live sports and a deep connection to the communities we serve. We're growing net retrans dollars at a rate of 20% year-over-year. We're growing our Digital revenue at a strong double-digit pace. We're growing our diginet revenue at Antenna TV and THIS TV. And we're managing expenses while continuing to invest in our business. This is a formula for meaningful and sustainable profitable growth. And part of what's fueling this growth is a dynamic that we're enjoying that runs counter to the recent chatter around cord shaving. Specifically, Tribune retrans subs have remained basically steady, while the number of local over-the-air-only homes we reached continues to actually increase. That's a testament to the ubiquitous appeal and power of broadcast TV.</p>
<p>As the whole debate over the so-called skinny bundles and who's in, who's out, we believe in the value of great content. For broadcasters, that means leading local news and live sports. The new entrants in the distribution game, the Sonys and Apples of this world, have confirmed our belief, declaring publicly that they want local content, our kind of content. That makes us essential in any size bundle. At our cable network, WGN America, despite bundles and cord shaving, we're growing distribution, not losing it. Last quarter, I highlighted our expectation that 65% of our homes would be converted by year-end. We're now expecting that to be over 75%. At minimum, we'll add several million new subscribers to the network. Carriage fees are up 50% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Our audience is growing. Our CPMs are growing. And perhaps most importantly, the ownership stakes we have in our original programming will give us a whole new set of revenue streams from syndication to SVOD, such as Hulu and Netflix, VOD, and the sale of international distribution rights both on the syndication front and the ever-growing SVOD front. We expect revenues at WGNA to grow 20% annually, and that we'll see profits in 2016. We're confident the network will grow significantly from there as revenues begin outpacing programming investments. This is all proof that our deliberate investment in quality, original and syndicated programming is creating value for our cable and satellite partners, our advertisers, our audiences and our shareholders.</p>
<p>Turning to our Digital and Data business, Gracenote is not facing secular headwinds, rather it's taking advantage of blustery tailwinds. With the explosion of distribution channels, content offerings and devices, navigational solutions that help guide consumer choice are becoming increasingly critical. That plays right into Gracenote's wheelhouse. Gracenote is the only company offering one-stop shopping for music, video and sports data solutions.</p>
<p>It's expanding into other verticals to continue meeting the needs and desires of our blue-chip clients like Apple, Google and Toyota, who are looking for a variety of data solutions, all in one place. As a result, we fully expect this business to have healthy revenue growth, with margin expansion every year. So, when I add it all up, I see a company pursuing the right strategies with strong cash flows and strong growth potential. I see a business uniquely positioned not merely to persevere in this rapidly changing environment, but to actually flourish.</p>
<p>Proof is in our numbers. So, let me say at outset, we're affirming our full-year revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance for 2015. Our top-line number is solid. Consolidated revenues were up 6% for both the quarter and for the first six months of the year and up across every line of our business.</p>
<p>Core advertising, excluding political, up; digital advertising is up significantly. Retrans and carriage fees, up; in fact, in every significant driver of revenue, in the largest segments of our Television business were up. Midway through the third quarter, as we look ahead to the rest of the year, we fully expect these trends to continue and that our consolidated revenue, excluding political, will again be up in the mid-single digits. That's the product and the promise of a robust diverse business.</p>
<p>Now, as we've discussed in detail with all of you before, we are also deliberately investing some of our revenue growth back into the business in two critically important operating areas. The first is in the implementation of new technology applications and the establishment of new shared services operations.</p>
<p>Much of our existing infrastructure was either outdated or was shared with Tribune Publishing. I mean, it's just simply not sustainable or workable for the spin-off of the Publishing business. While these new systems will cost us now, they will enable us to manage the business more efficiently and cost effectively going forward. We expect to achieve a significant annual run rate savings, reaching far into the millions.</p>
<p>The second area we're continuing to steadily invest in is high-quality content at WGN America. We're following through on our announced plans to produce two new shows for air in 2016. Those are Outsiders and Underground.</p>
<p>In order to give ourselves maximum scheduling flexibility next year when the Summer Olympics is staged, we decided to begin production on both shows in the second quarter. This resulted in higher production costs in this quarter. But let me be crystal clear; our investment in these shows have not changed. Same shows, same license fee, same investment in ownership of the shows. It's just that our expenses are hitting disproportionately in this quarter. And we won't see the benefits of our investment in the shows, whether from SVOD deals, domestic or international or international distribution and other secondary revenue streams, until next year and beyond.</p>
<p>In the case of Manhattan, just as one example, we already have a Hulu deal in place. In addition, our partner, Lionsgate, has sold the international rights into 17 international markets and growing. But we're not in a position yet to book that revenue. The cash will materialize later when we and our partners begin airing the show.</p>
<p>In addition, second quarter adjusted EBITDA and operating profits were impacted by a change in the timing of amortization for Salem and Manhattan, which had the effect of shifting roughly $14 million of amortization expense to 2015 from 2016. The lion's share of that $14 million change, about $13 million of it, also burdened our books in Q2. Chandler's going to walk you through a more detailed look at our overall financials in a moment, and he'll dig deeper into those at WGNA.</p>
<p>Now, those of you who I've met in person and over the phone know that I always state that I prefer to talk performance over promise because it's performance that ultimately counts. As such, I'm going to ask you to please bear with me as I detail our measurable positive matrix that illustrate the strength of our current operations in the current environment.</p>
<p>So, let's start by taking a deeper diver into the largest segment of our business, TV and Entertainment, where, I said earlier, the advertising environment is kind of flattish. The TV and Entertainment quarterly revenues were up 4% to more than $445 million. Core advertising revenue was up a little more than 2%. We achieved revenue growth, even as total advertising spending declined a bit in many of our markets. We grew core advertising market share in all of our top seven markets, and we grew share across all 42 stations by about half a point.</p>
<p>Results at our biggest station were particularly strong in Q2. Core advertising at PIX here in New York was up more than 20%. Share was up two points. At KTLA, ad revenue was up more than 8% and share was up more than a half point. And in Chicago, core ad revenue was up 1% and market share grew more than a full point.</p>
<p>Digital, very important on our front. Digital advertising revenue across our stations grew 24% in the quarter. Retransmission revenues were up 23%. And we're maintaining our subscriber base and we're also actually increasing our subscriber base.</p>
<p>These results are a clear demonstration that our programming strategies are working on our station front. When you look at news, our commitment to being the local station of record continues to draw audiences and drive rating growth. Many of our markets have very good May sweeps period. Let me quickly run through a few quick highlights. PIX saw total news ratings across all time periods increase 14% over the last year. KTLA, which is number one in morning news, saw a healthy 12% increase in the critical 10 PM news. In Chicago, WGN's 4 PM news was up 50%, and its 5 PM news was up 31%. And finally, at our CW station in Denver, morning news was up as much as 60% depending on the time period.</p>
<p>Our commitment to live local sports is also working, especially with the Yankees, Mets, and Cubs in the thick of the race. In New York, my first-place Mets, with their ratings on PIX are up 30% over the games we carried last second quarter. On nights when we had baseball leading into news at PIX, albeit the Mets or the Yankees, ratings for news were up more than 56%, showing the power of the great local sport lead-ins into our local news. In Chicago, same story, season-to-date ratings for the Cubs are up 95% versus a year ago. This strength in local content, along with our new common website platform, is driving both traffic and digital revenue.</p>
<p>Unique visitors to our websites in Q2 reached more than 80 million, that's about up 20% compared to last year. And we also saw sequential growth in traffic in the first half of the year as well. That drove Digital revenues higher by 24%.</p>
<p>Finally, the strength of our TV stations and their news operations and related websites put us in a great position for next year's presidential election. Again, we have 13 stations in battleground states, many with contested primaries to the Senate as well as the Presidency.</p>
<p>Now, let's turn to WGN America. Again, this is a network growing audience, growing subscribers and growing carriage fees by building a recognizable brand. In fact, WGNA is increasing audience, even if the broader ad-supported cable industry is talking about losing them. Specifically, if you look at total day, the audiences of mature cable networks in the first quarter and second quarter declined 10%, 8%, respectively. During that same time on a total-day basis, our audience of WGN America increased 7% in Q1 and 11% in Q2.</p>
<p>The difference in primetime between WGNA and our competitors is even more dramatic. While the primetime audience for mature cable networks was down 9%, WGN audience was up 8% in the quarter. And remember, these audience gains are being generated without the benefit of Season 2 of Manhattan or our exclusive syndicated programs like Persons of Interest and Elementary, all of which are going to join WGNA's lineup in the fourth quarter. These kinds of audience gains are helping us write good business in the upfront. We're seeing double-digit increase in CPM rates for our original and exclusive syndicated series. Quality programming and larger audiences are driving value for our cable and satellite partners.</p>
<p>These things are making WGNA more attractive to them, and they're accelerating WGNA's conversion to a basic cable network. As such, WGNA's carriage revenues were up 51%, driven by higher per-sub fees, and more encouragingly, an actual increase of subscribers of about 2% this year.</p>
<p>On the programming front, Season 2 of Salem delivered on all of our expectations and furthered our strategic branding objectives for the network. It has a large loyal audience of more than 1 million viewers a week, which is hugely important for a growing network like WGNA. We're also excited about Season 2 of Manhattan, which launches October 13 and which some critics have called a dramatic gem.</p>
<p>Looking ahead to the fourth quarter, we should be very strong, because in addition to Manhattan, WGNA will add two new extremely popular exclusive syndicated programs to our lineup, namely Elementary and Persons of Interest. We expect WGNA ratings to jump again for two reasons. First, these programs are even more popular in the first run than Blue Bloods, which we launched earlier this year and has increased audience by as much as 80% wherever we've run it. Second, in contrast to and in improving upon Blue Bloods, we have the exclusive cable rights to both Elementary and PoI. In fact, two-thirds of WGNA's primetime programming will be all new in Q4. And we expect ratings to increase by more than 50%. And further out in 2016, WGNA will launch Outsiders and Underground, both of which we own a piece of. I'm sure you saw the announcement that Oscar winner, John Legend, has signed on as Executive Producer in Underground and to oversee the music for the show. As one reporter said, that could be a move-the-needle moment for WGNA.</p>
<p>Let's turn to our Digital and Data business. Gracenote, we continue executing on our strategy to expand this business both geographically and by launching new verticals in important categories. And again, our strategy is delivering. Second quarter revenues were up 29% or almost $10 million, and adjusted EBITDA increased almost $7 million. These gains were fueled in large part by last year's acquisition of HWW, Baseline and What's ON India. The big news in the second quarter was the strategic acquisition of three sports data companies: namely, Infostrada, SportsDirect, Covers, and the launch of Gracenote Sports.</p>
<p>These acquisitions made Gracenote the first global provider of data for music, video and sports, and they enable the company to provide one-stop solutions for a roster of blue-chip clients in the U.S. and around the world, clients such as Toyota, Ford, Roku, Google and Apple.</p>
<p>Like music and video data, demand for sports entertainment is exploding. Infostrada Sports and SportsDirect produce and distribute the most extensive set of sports data in North America, Europe and Asia, with critical information in data for all the major professional sports leagues around the world, including the NFL, NBA, NHL, Major League Baseball, European Football and the Olympics.</p>
<p>Gracenote will tap into these data sets and leverage its own entertainment data experience to create new data-driven sports products and services for fantasy sports and fan applications, as well as a variety of online broadcast and print media.</p>
<p>And these acquisitions are already gaining traction. For example, Gracenote just won its first sports deal from The Canadian Broadcasting Company to bring regional sports scores and its statistics to CBC's online properties.</p>
<p>And Gracenote won the deal over several incumbents. Gracenote is also deepening its relationship with Apple and Google. Last year, Apple chose to power its international streaming music service. In the second quarter of this year, as they prepare to launch Apple Music here in the States, Apple again came to Gracenote.</p>
<p>Today, our data helps to power the playlists in radio stations of Apple Music for millions of fans, something we're incredibly proud of. Gracenote also expanded its business relationship with Google to provide geo-listings for the search giant in 10 different regions across the globe.</p>
<p>On the automotive side, almost every major automaker is now embracing Gracenote technology in one form or another, with a couple of significant agreements being renewed or expanded in Q2. For example, we renewed our long-standing agreement to provide music technology and data in Toyota vehicles for several more years to come.</p>
<p>And we expanded our long-term relationship with BMW, making the company's new 7 Series vehicle, the first to carry Gracenote's newest innovation called MusicID radio. MusicID radio brings together traditional radio with popular streaming services like Napster and Rhapsody. In sum, Gracenote is a business on the rise, the leader in the space, well positioned to take advantage of the explosion in data and digital devices and grow its revenues and margins.</p>
<p>Before I close, I want to talk a little bit about another one of our valuable assets, namely spectrum. The FCC is targeting an auction at the end of the first quarter of 2016, and we're ramping up our preparations accordingly. We've been active with the FCC together with Fox, Univision, and Ion, working with FCC staff on the rule-making process. And we're leaning forward on potential approaches to the auction, including channel sharing in major markets, which may allow us to monetize spectrum with minimal impact to our operating revenues and profits. As I've said before, we have spectrum in very valuable markets, and we're keenly focused on the potential opportunities presented by the auction.</p>
<p>To wrap up, our operations is thriving, and in the face of secular challenges, we're growing audience, subscribers and advertiser and affiliate revenues. Our Digital and Data business is winning new clients and deepening its business with its existing blue-chip client roster. We're mindfully choosing to invest in our businesses. We can slow down or speed up these investments as we see fit. We are simply not sitting still. We're generating strong revenue growth. We help produce significant cash flow, augmented by what has historically been $200 million in annual dividends from our equity stakes (23:06) in Food Network and CareerBuilder. We've used that money to return more than $1 billion to shareholders this year and to capitalize on what we see as long-term opportunities for future growth. We're excited by what lies ahead and the value this company is bringing and will continue to bring to shareholders for years to come.</p>
<p>Now as I turn the call over to our new Interim CFO, Chandler Bigelow, I want to mention how fortunate we really are to have someone of Chandler's talents and experience and his ability to step into this role on a temporary basis. Many of you are familiar with Chandler. He is a 17-year Tribune veteran, previously served as CFO of the company from 2008 to 2013. He's intimately familiar with the company, our lines of business and with our financial information.</p>
<p>So, let me turn it over to Chandler.</p>
<p><strong>Chandler Bigelow - Executive Vice President, Chief Business Strategies & Operations Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Peter, and good morning, everyone. A quick reminder that we have posted a presentation on our website that contains supporting materials for our discussion this morning.</p>
<p>As Peter mentioned, we continue to make progress against our strategic objectives, and we are pleased to report that for the second consecutive quarter, Tribune produced consolidated revenue growth of 6% on a year-over-year basis. This growth is the result of increases across nearly all of our lines of business.</p>
<p>As Peter mentioned, core TV station ad revenue up, Digital line revenue up, retransmission consent revenue, carriage fees and the continued expansion of our Digital and Data business. These results, combined with the significant and stable cash flow that we received from our equity investments, provide us with the opportunity to invest back in our business and drive areas of future growth such as our investments in original programming.</p>
<p>As a result of the progress we have made so far this year, coupled with our outlook for the remainder of the year, as Peter mentioned, we are reiterating our consolidated revenue guidance for 2015 of between $2 billion and $2.03 billion and adjusted EBITDA guidance of between $480 million and $495 million. In addition, we expect that the cash we receive from our equity investments this year will be approximately $195 million.</p>
<p>Now, let me turn to some of our financial details. Again, as Peter mentioned, on a consolidated basis for the second quarter of 2015, net revenue grew 6% to approximately $502 million. I would point out that if you exclude political advertising from both periods, our consolidated revenues grew 7% in the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Consolidated adjusted EBITDA declined to $92 million in the second quarter 2015, representing a $38 million or 29% decrease over the second quarter of last year. Nearly all of this decline is attributable to a $35 million year-over-year increase in programming expenses at WGN America and Tribune Studios, which I will discuss in greater detail in a moment.</p>
<p>In addition, our other expenses increased in the quarter as we continue to invest in our people, our operations and our technology infrastructure. For the quarter, the company reported a net loss of $0.04 per share compared to earnings from continuing operations of $0.67 per share in the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>I would highlight that in the second quarter of this year, the company reported a $37 million pre-tax loss on the extinguishment of our debt related to our bond yield and amended term loan this past June, and that the second quarter of last year benefited from a $72 million increase in our equity income related to our share of the sale of Classified Ventures' sale of Apartments.com.</p>
<p>Now in terms of the first half of this year, consolidated operating revenues grew 6% or $53 million to $974 million. Excluding political and the revenue generated by airing the Super Bowl on 14 FOX stations last year and only two NBC stations this year, our consolidated operating revenue grew 8% in the first half of 2015. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA decreased $47 million or 18% to $221 million in the first half of 2015. And $40 million of this decrease is attributable to increases in programming expenses at WGN America and the Tribune Studios. In addition, we have already received $129 million of cash from our equity investments in the first half of this year.</p>
<p>Now, turning to our Television and Entertainment segment, in the second quarter of 2015, revenue grew 4% to $446 million, and adjusted EBITDA declined 26% to $104 million. Our top-line growth in the quarter was primarily driven by a 27% increase in retransmission consent revenues at our broadcast stations to $70 million and increases in carriage fees of 48% to $22 million, primarily at WGN America.</p>
<p>Core advertising revenue grew 2% during the quarter, and note that we define core advertising revenue as the sum of our local and national ad sales only, excluding political, which is consistent with how we have historically reported core revenue performance.</p>
<p>As Peter just described, this growth is driven by market share gains across our largest markets. Adjusted EBITDA declined in the second quarter 2015, primarily due to increases in programming expenses and increases in compensation as we continue to expand our profitable news operations and invest in our sales operations.</p>
<p>As we mentioned, the primary driver of the increase in our expenses is due to increases in programming costs. Total TV&E programming costs for the quarter were $138 million, an increase of $43 million compared to the second quarter of last year. This increase was driven by two items primarily. First, we experienced higher amortization of license fees for Salem and Manhattan due to the change in the timing of amortization of our first-run original programs as we've discussed with you last quarter. As Peter mentioned, in the second quarter, we incurred $13 million of the $14 million of increased amortization that we disclosed we would incur this year.</p>
<p>Second, we incurred product costs at Tribune Studios for the second season of Manhattan as well as the first seasons of our new co-owned original programs, Underground and Outsiders, both of which went into production during the second quarter, and are anticipated to air in the first half of next year. Note that for shows that we co-produced including Manhattan, Underground and Outsiders, our share of production deficit costs are expensed as the shows are produced. We will recognize revenue as these shows are sold in secondary markets. The expenses for these three shows were $11 million in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Now turning to our Digital and Data segment, both revenues and adjusted EBITDA increased during the quarter primarily as a function of acquisitions we made in 2014 and in the second quarter of 2015. On a reported basis, revenues increased 29% to $44 million in the quarter and adjusted EBITDA increased to $6.6 million from a loss of $1 million in the second quarter a year ago. During the second quarter, we made strategic acquisitions totaling $70 million. Note that we do not anticipate that these acquisitions will have a material impact on our results in the remainder of 2015. In terms of the remainder of the year, we are reaffirming our full year guidance for Digital and Data and expect that as the past year, the segment will have a stronger relative fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Now turning to Corporate and Other, which includes the results of our real estate operations. In the second quarter of 2015, real estate revenue was $12 million. This was offset by real estate expenses and corporate expenses, resulting in a negative impact to adjusted EBITDA of $19 million. The decline in real estate revenues was driven by an expected reduction in space – expected reduction in space leased by Tribune Publishing at several properties, as well as the sale of our production facility and land in Baltimore, which was completed at the end of last year. Increases in corporate expenses were mainly a result of the implementation of new technology and back-office infrastructure. These new technologies and services are primarily being implemented and certain functions and systems were separated as part of the spin-off of Tribune Publishing last year.</p>
<p>Now from a balance sheet perspective, we ended the quarter with cash at $404 million. In the first half of the year, our distributions to shareholders and including dividends and stock repurchases totaled $854 million. In June of this year, we successfully refinanced our term loan facility with proceeds from the issuance of a $1.1 billion 5.875% senior note. This activity resulted in a charge to our P&L of $37 million for a loss on extinguishment of debt. This refinancing has resulted in a revision of our cash interest downward from $140 million to approximately $130 million as our first semiannual interest payment on the new notes will occur at the beginning of next year. Our cash tax guidance number was also impacted by the refinancing, among other things, and is now expected to be between $95 million and $100 million in 2015.</p>
<p>On August 1, 2015, we entered into an agreement to sell all of our interest in Newsday Holdings, LLC, which will result in a payment of $103 million of the existing deferred tax liability that is recorded on our balance sheet. This tax payment is expected to be paid later this year. Our previously authorized stock repurchase program remains in place. As of the end of the second quarter, we had repurchased approximately $253 million of the $400 million authorized under the program. And as of yesterday, we had repurchased $333 million of the $400 million authorized, leaving $67 million available for repurchases under the current program.</p>
<p>That concludes my remarks, and we'll now open up the lines for questions. And thank you very much.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. The first question comes from John Janedis from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Janedis - Jefferies LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks and good morning. Peter, two questions. First, some of your peers had talked about struggling to monetize ratings. Given your sports and news ratings, can you talk about the timing around the monetization, meaning, was it immediate for you or does it accelerate further as the summer goes along, and given the ratings, are CPMs moving noticeably higher in those dayparts?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>First and foremost, as we get into the fall and our inventory winds up, tightening up with the introduction of new shows, the NFL, et cetera, we're uniquely positioned to move CPMs with the value of our programming, the demand on our inventory, et cetera. So, we anticipate, as we look to the back half of the year, our inventory will, in fact, become more valuable to our advertisers, and we will, in fact, monetize it accordingly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Janedis - Jefferies LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thanks. And then secondly, just given the comments out of the FCC yesterday on (34:40) network nonduplication and syndex, on a practical level, do you see any measurable impact on your long-term guidance or how retrans gets negotiated?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>No. At this point, we see no measurable impact. Look, we have contracts with our network affiliates that clearly define exclusivity. We think that this is – clearly, we'll be opposed to any infringement on that exclusivity or any wiggle room on that definition. I have one great year of – one great semester of law school. I do have our GC here who was Chief of Staff of the FCC. If you don't mind, I'm just going to turn it over to him for a couple of minutes to opine.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward P. Lazarus - Executive Vice President & General Counsel</span></strong></p>
<p>So, it's Eddie Lazarus and the short answer to the question is that, first of all, they haven't actually repealed the rule yet. If they do, we will oppose the repeal. If they do, it simply takes away the FCC as a forum for registering violations of our exclusivity, that's all still enforceable in court. And as a result of that, we don't anticipate any dramatic change in the basic balance of retransmission consent.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Janedis - Jefferies LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thanks, Eddie. Thanks, Peter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from Marci Ryvicker from Wells Fargo. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marci L. Ryvicker - Wells Fargo Securities LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Peter, you opened up talking about the skinny bundle, and clearly that's what caused just the meltdown or part of the meltdown from last week. So, the first question is where do you see WGN America in the skinny bundle? Will it be included? Are you having any conversations at this point?</p>
<p>And then, my second question is related to the revenue outlook you gave for the second quarter. You said consolidated revenue, ex political, up mid-single digits. Can you talk about how core advertising might be pacing today relative to that up 2.3% is on Q2?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Look. In terms of the skinny bundle, we have every expectation that WGNA will be part of it. And again, Marci, I just look to our current performance with each and every renewal, WGNA is being embraced by distribution sources.</p>
<p>We are not only getting conversion and conversion at a highly accelerated rate. I mean, we were thinking that by the end of the year, two-thirds of our renewals will convert. We're expecting three quarters, if not, better.</p>
<p>So, when we look towards the skinny bundle, we feel that we offer a wholesome offering to our distribution providers, WGNA's value is going up. The company's value is there. So, we expect WGNA will in fact be part of all of our bundling deals.</p>
<p>When you look toward core advertising, from our standpoint, again, core was up a little more than 2%. We have seen some strength in auto. We've actually seen a lot – and I think this is a good sign, some real strength in restaurants, which basically means cash in pocket is moving. We anticipate that as we look forward in core, it's going to be in that mid-single-digit range. The outlook is in that area, and we just – we have to execute on it, and we will.</p>

<p>The next question comes from Ryan Fiftal from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you. I have one for Chandler and one for Peter. So, I guess, quickly, Chandler, on the tax payment related to Newsday, just – I guess remind me, does that represent a settlement with IRS? And would that fully satisfy any potential tax liabilities on that? And also, maybe an update on where you are with the Cubs, and if that's a reasonable expectation for the potential tax liability there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chandler Bigelow - Executive Vice President, Chief Business Strategies & Operations Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Hi, Ryan. To answer your question, it does not represent – it does not resolve or impact the ongoing discussions with the IRS. I would just give you a little background that as part of the company's overall review of its current and long-term business opportunities and relationships with Cablevision, we made a decision to allow Cablevision to exercise its call on the partnership. And that, in terms of the actual $103 million payment that I discussed, it's always been carried as a liability on the balance sheet, and we would expect that -based on this that that payment could be made by the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, there could still be some potential tax liability unused there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chandler Bigelow - Executive Vice President, Chief Business Strategies & Operations Officer and Interim Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>As far as we know, we don't know, but there could be.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right. Thank you. And then – then Peter, maybe question on longer-term interest in the cable network business, I mean, the WGN investments, I think, they make quite a bit of sense. You had an asset that maybe wouldn't have survived going forward. You've been reinvesting. You've had some success so far. So, I mean, if we assume that WGNA grows according to your outlook, that would leave you guys with a single cable network, which is kind of an outlier in the space, kind of one toe in that business. So, is that a situation you'd be comfortable with, or do you think you'd need to get bigger, or would you potentially be a seller of that asset? Any color there would be great.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Well, first, let me have a minor trouble with describing us as a bit of an outlier. I actually think our distinctiveness is advantageous in this environment, especially with WGNA. What we have is a very robust local station group. And we have a highly valuable WGNA. And when we go with both to our cable satellite and distribution partners, we are able to offer a fulsome value to them.</p>
<p>I merely point to, the environment isn't – is aggressive, but our performance speaks to the value that we're creating. We've increased distribution. We're increasing carriage fees plus 50%. We're doing it by increasing ratings with frankly very little of our new programming and our new programming tonnage hitting the year, which is why we're so excited about Q4.</p>
<p>We are bucking the trend. We're bucking the trend by having a bigger audience. We're bucking the trend by providing increased – and I'm going underline that, increased value to cable operators. We're doing it reasonably. We're doing it in partnership with our distribution partners, and we're noticing great success. That is why we look to 2016 and beyond to see profits occurring, profits growing. And as we mindfully invest in the business, down the road, we expect to have a cable network that's going to look very much like a cable network does today, which is, with expenses roughly in that 50% range of total revenue and margins of around 30%.</p>
<p>So, we've seen nothing but positive signs, and again, reconfirmed by all of our cable operators, basically accelerating our conversion, accelerating even faster than we even anticipated or reflected to you all.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Fiftal - Morgan Stanley & Co. LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, I guess looking forward, assuming WGNA is successful, do you think there's more scope for further reinvestment in cable networks or do you look at WGNA as it was more of a one-off given the unique circumstances it was in?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>I think you've seen by our manner, we don't sit still. We will look at every opportunity that's out there and see if it could help create shareholder value, permanent shareholder value and work within our strategies and our financial structure. Thank you.</p>

<p>The next question comes from Richard Greenfield with BTIG. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Thanks for taking the question. If we could just go back to the comments about the FCC order that was circulated, would just like to better understand exactly what the process would be. So, if there was a retrans dispute and somebody tried to import a distant signal, would that be possible if this order was approved? The FCC also has this commentary in there about exploring or updating the good faith negotiating issue related to retrans. Just wondering what exactly that means.</p>
<p>And then, despite how well you're doing, obviously, some of your peers are clearly talking about the fact that their advertising is suffering and their subscription fees are coming in below expectations, even up to Disney.</p>
<p>And just wondering, as you think about the long-term forecasting, how do you think about the reverse retrans, and how much of your retrans dollars you'll be able to keep just given the fact that your network parents seem to be suffering far more than they have in the past?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward P. Lazarus - Executive Vice President & General Counsel</span></strong></p>
<p>I'll start. This is Eddie Lazarus. I'll start on the FCC point and then turn in it back over to Peter. But as we said, Richard, right now, exclusivity which we get from our network affiliation agreements, that's basically enforceable in two ways. It's enforceable in court and it's enforceable with the FCC. If the FCC, I stress the if, repeals the (44:31-44:36) on the line. I'm not...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Somebody should put themselves on mute, please. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward P. Lazarus - Executive Vice President & General Counsel</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. But it will be enforceable in court. We feel like we'll be in a very strong contractual position, so that that won't substantially affect the balance of retrans. As for the good faith negotiation question, it's just too soon to know what the FCC might mean, but we've always negotiated in good faith, and we would continue to negotiate in good faith, so we don't expect that to affect us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rich S. Greenfield - BTIG LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, if somebody tried to import, let's just say a Boston station was dropped and they tried to important the Hartford signal, you would be able to then take them to court and you'd have to go to court to block that importation. Is that essentially what would be required then?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward P. Lazarus - Executive Vice President & General Counsel</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, they also might very well be in breach of their own network affiliation agreements, which they wouldn't want to do. So, this is a case-by-case basis, Rich. I mean, we're not going to conduct a legal seminar on this call. But we oppose this and we oppose the rule change. We don't like it. But we'll be in fine shape, regardless.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, Rich, I'll answer the other two parts of your single question. First is, why are we noticing success. I think the delineation is fairly simple. Our competitors are mature cable networks. We're a new cable network. And we are on the rise. And I think that is a very important distinction between those that exist and WGNA.</p>
<p>And in terms of reverse retrans comment, we've given guidance on this. We're looking at net 50% for years to come. And I think that is reflective of the balance in the ecosystem.</p>
<p>So, next question.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Good morning. First question, please. Did I hear you say in the back half of the year you're expecting your core TV station ad revenue to be up in mid-single digits in the third quarter and fourth quarter? And then also along the same lines, was there any new programming on your TV stations in the second quarter that helped you lead to 2% plus core advertising growth? And I have a follow-up. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Look, it's very challenging. Having been a president of Entertainment, it's always extremely challenging to look at particular shows and say this show or that show is going to go up. And, again, I want to make sure I'm clear, low to mid-single digits. Okay. Low to mid-single digits. But as we look out, as we look at our CBS affiliates with Thursday Night Football, as we look at what was optimism both on the Fox primetime front, as well as the CW primetime front, we expect that part of our business will be strong.</p>
<p>And let's not forget, I had outlined very, very clearly the strength of our news and its expansion, its increased audiences, and local news accounts for over 40% of all of our revenue. We like our momentum going in. We think our news is improving. We love the idea that especially in markets, big markets like Chicago and New York, we're able to combine pennant race teams like the Yankees and the Mets and the Cubs with news. It's great lead-in. PIX is clearly experiencing solid ratings growth from that kind of dynamic. That's how we look at third quarter and fourth quarter and think we're in good stead. But thanks for the question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig A. Huber - Huber Research Partners LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Peter, if I could also just ask you, if you take out WGN from the performance in the second quarter, with the TV stations' EBITDA, was it up, say, low to mid-single digits because you reported down 26% for EBITDA in that segment...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Craig, we don't break things out that way. We look at our whole TV segment. But, again, thank you.</p>

<p>The next question comes from Lance Vitanza from CRT Capital Group. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lance Vitanza - CRT Capital Group LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Thanks. My question is on the WGNA model. The long-term outlook, revenue is growing 20%, content is 50% of revenues. What are the other variable costs there? I'm trying to get a handle on the incremental margin. I mean, how much EBITDA the network generates if revenue were to reach $1 billion someday? And then I do have a follow-up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Look, as we look at more mature cable networks, all of them basically are around that 30% margin range. And that guides our thinking and disciplines our thought process along the way. And again, one of the things we're incredibly mindful of is, we can always accelerate/decelerate the investment along the way to see where we are in terms of our performance. But it needs to be, and we're nearing that stage where there is a critical mass of audience, critical mass of offerings, so that the value for advertisers, for our affiliates, for our audience is there. So – but that's really the goal, about 30% margins. And you have a follow-up?</p>

<p><strong><span class="question">Hamed Khorsand - BWS Financial, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good morning. Just a two-part question here. First off, on the revenue side, the gains that you were talking about earlier, WPIX and KTLA, were those really just more of a catch-up as far as the rates you were hoping to receive last year, but it was really just poor performance and this was just a one-time kind of event?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>No. You know, last year – look, do I think that there's improvement when I look at WPIX? Do I think there's improvement in news? Yes. Our audience is growing. Do I think it's off of a particularly low-base? No. I mean, look, we put in new leadership; we put in new news and news director. We put in a new sales force. We did the things necessary to respect and honor a New York local news station, one that's been here since 1948, and fortunately the one that I grew up with, and it is just going to simply have to be best-in-class. It is going to have to represent what's been – the local news station looks like. And it's been getting – and right now, I think we're making great strides on that and our revenues are reflecting it. And we're going to continue to press on that front. That's a group that's really hardened by the work that they're doing and really hardened by the results that they're producing. Thank you.</p>

<p><strong><span class="question">Tracy Beth Young - Evercore ISI</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Just since we've talked a lot about TV, do you have any commentary on the real estate front or where the developments are there? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Again, as previously stated, we are moving as quickly as possible to quickly make the adjustments both on ordinances, et cetera, to accelerate the maximum net present value of those properties, so that we are at the ready to quickly monetize when a proper relationship can be forged. So, we're moving quickly. We are incredibly mindful of it, and result's to be determined. Thank you.</p>

<p>The next question comes from Jim Goss from Barrington Research. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James C. Goss - Barrington Research Associates, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. I had a couple of areas involving WGNA. One, I was wondering if you have a unique opportunity to create an OTT service that could combine WGNA with the local broadcast affiliate that you own in that market, or is that purely the network's province in all those cases? And separately, you mentioned that WGNA is effectively a new cable system, that it's still proven and known commodity. And I'm wondering if viewers appreciate the difference. And what do you think they notice, and how does that factor into your potential success?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Good questions. Let me start out with the WGNA question. By far and away, viewers notice the change. When you are looking at primetime that has a proliferation of America's Funniest Home Video, when you are looking across outside of Chicago or Chicago local news, and now all of a sudden, you're seeing Blue Bloods, now all of a sudden, you are seeing promos for Persons of Interest and Elementary, now all of a sudden when you were seeing shows like Salem and Manhattan, now all of a sudden, when you are seeing dual-feed, again, superstation has a single feed, but WGNA as a cable network has a dual-feed, there is a noticeable difference.</p>
<p>Now, again, is this an overnight revolution? It is not. That's exactly why we have to invest in our content so that we get WGNA redefined. We get it on people's mental menu of channels that they will in fact take a look at. But it is noticeable, and we follow a lot of what's going on on social media. We go out there every now and then to do some research. And I'd spoken so long that I forgot your first question, so I'm going to ask you to repeat it. I apologize.</p>
<p>Could you please – oh, OTT, I got it. Thanks. So, I – we're certainly not going to concede that it is merely the network's domain of doing OTT, nor do I think we should be in a position to be a first mover on any of it. It's one of our options. We're all taking to look at what's going on at OTT. It seems clear that the rules and the definitions and how the game will be played is by far and away not to find. But the single best thing we can do: create great local news stations, great local stations, great local news, great local sports, help WGNA be a fulsome, valuable network, and we'll have optionality. So, I think that's our approach at this point. And I'm glad we're making progress on all fronts.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from Barry Lucas from Gabelli & Company. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Barry L. Lucas - Gabelli & Company</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks and good morning, Peter. I was hoping you could be fairly specific in this answer and give you a chance to really underscore the carriage improvements at WGNA, and that is, how is G&A performing at those MVPDs that have been skinning down their programming packages, and by that I mean Dish or Cable One or Insight?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Well, look. I think, again, we look at it overall. And I think the overall numbers are speaking for themselves. We are growing. We are noticing success with each and every one of our renewals. Again, I think we are in a bit of a different situation in that we're a network on the rise. And our sub-growth is there. Our conversion rate is there. Our rate growth is there. So, again, I think that what we are doing and what is somewhat guarding us from this skinning down is the fact that we have positive trajectory as an offering. Let's take our positive matrix aside, we had a positive trajectory as an offering, and that's why we're noticing success. So, thank you for the question.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Liguori - President, Chief Executive Officer & Director</strong></p>
<p>Okay, guys. I think that's it for now. I really appreciate everyone joining us. I hope you've got fulsome answers to your questions, and look forward to speaking to you all in the future. Take care. Have a good day.</p>
