<p>As an important symbol of respect, it is our customer significant Telstra event to acknowledge Australia's first people, to lay therefore I'd like to acknowledge that we made on the traditional lands of the Get GAL people of the organization and pay my respects to elders, both past and present.</p>
<p>After presentations from our CEO, Andrew Penn and our CFO, Warwick Bray, we will be taking questions from investors, analysts in here in Sydney and on the phone. With that, I'll hand over to Andy. Good morning, Andy.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Penn</strong></p>
<p>Well, thanks very much, Peter and good morning everybody, thanks very much for hooking in for being here personally, also for those that are hooked in via web live coverage of this event and welcome to Telstra's annual results presentation for the year ended June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>In my presentation this morning I'm going to cover three topics. Firstly, I will provide you with a brief overview of the highlights from this year's results. I'll then hand over to Warwick Bray, our new Chief Financial Officer, who will take you through the financial result numbers in detail. And finally, I will then outline our progress against the implementation and execution of our strategy. Warwick and I will then conclude the session to die by taking any questions that you might have in relation to results.</p>
<p>So with that, let me turn now immediately to the highlights. On a reported basis, total income excluding finance income for the year increased 1.2% to AUD26.6 billion. EBITDA was down 3.5% to AUD10.7 billion. And net profit after-tax was down 5.8% to AUD4.3 billion on a reported basis. On a comparative basis, our results were of course affected by the sales of our Hong Kong mobiles business sales in May 2014. And 2014 included the one-off profit from that sale, as well as 11 months of operating revenues and profits.</p>
<p>So given that and on a guidance basis which excludes the one-off profit on the sales of AUF561 million total income excluding finance income increased 2.3% AUD26.3 billion, EBITDA increased 2% to AUD10.8 billion and net profit after-tax increased 9.8% to AUD4.4 billion. If we also exclude the 2014 operating results of CSL, total income grew 6.6% to AUD26.3 billion and EBITDA grew by 4.5% to AUD10.8 billion.</p>
<p>Let me turn to the other highlights. Earnings per share increased marginally 0.3% to AUD0.345 per share. The Board has declared a final dividend of AUD0.155 per share taking the total dividend for the year to AUD0.305 per share, up 3.3% on 2014. Including the AUD1 billion buyback that we did in October of 2014, this year we returned AUD4.7 billion to shareholders. Encouragingly, as we continue to focus on lifting customer efficacy, our NPS score improved by five points during the year. This builds on improvements that we also achieved in 2014. Notwithstanding this, and whilst we have made progress, good progress, I know that we still have more to do.</p>
<p>During the year we continue to add new customers with 664,000 retail mobile net new services and 189,000 retail fixed broadband net new services. Our strategy remains unchanged, and it is to improve customer efficacy, drive value from the core of our business, and build new growth businesses. And I'm going to come back to this after Warwick has spoken about our financial results and share with you how we have progressed against the delivery of this strategy during 2015. However, I also wanted to take a moment to comment on how we are raising the bar at Telstra.</p>
<p>Recently, I took the opportunity when speaking at SEDA as the new CEO. To describe our vision. Our vision to be a world-class technology company that empowers people to connect, and if we are to achieve that vision we need to lift our aspiration levels further to achieve world-class customer service, deliver world-class technology supported by world-class networks and delivery. It's not a change of strategy, it is an increase in the level of our aspiration. And in this regard we have already announced an increase in our level of investments into our networks to maintain our leadership. We will be increasing our CapEx to sales ratio in 2016 and 2017 to 15% of sales taking our total CapEx to over AUD4 billion a year.</p>
<p>Our network is one of the biggest influences on preference and efficacy with our customers and that's why we have been investing billions of dollars for many years, and why we will continue to do so. The increased capital expenditure investment will provide more than another AUD0.5 billion for mobiles. In junction with the AUD2.3 billion that we have invested in 2015 including Spectrum, over the three years to June 2017 we expect to have invested more than AUD5 billion into Telstra's leading mobile network.</p>
<p>We will continue to expand 4G to 99% of the population. We will increase our mobile footprint coverage to more than 2.5 million square kilometers which we estimate is more than double that of our nearest competitor. We will build in excess of 750 new mobile base stations increasing our total network to over 9,000 sites and bringing coverage to new communities in regional Australia. We will deploy in excess of 750 small cells providing infill in areas of low signal strength. We will start rapidly deploying the next generation of LTE Technology including Voice over LTE, LTE broadcast, and the next stage of LTE advanced, which can deliver peak speeds, download speeds of up to 600 megabits per second. And by fully leveraging our superior spectrum holdings, we will create new areas of coverage and new levels of coverage and performance leadership for 4GX.</p>
<p>And of course we're not just investing in our mobile network, our extensive investment in our fixed and other networks will continue. Over the next two years we will invest in our IDEA cellular network, significantly increasing our exchange back hold capacity and expanding our landline quality across the country. We will also continue to build Australia's largest Wi-Fi network which we commenced this year, Telstra Air, and I will talk about this more in later detail.</p>
<p>To deliver world-class technology though we must have world-class networks and we are committed to having the best networks in Australia and ensuring that that's what our customers experience.</p>
<p>Let me now hand over to Warwick who will take you through the financial results in more detail and I will come back and talk about how we're progressing inside strategy in a few moments. Thanks, Warwick.</p>
<p><strong>Warwick Bray </strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Andy. And good morning to everyone who has joined us today either in person or by a webcast. Presentation this morning breaks down as, firstly, the overall results and comments on how we've tracked against guidance and the prior period. Secondly, the business unit product performance. Thirdly, our expenses and productivity. Fourthly, an update on our main balance sheet movements, our capital position, and portfolio management activity, including acquisitions. And finally some comments on guidance for FY16.</p>
<p>We now move to the overall performance of the business. Our FY15 results were consistent with our guidance across income, EBITDA, CapEx, and free cash flow. On a reported basis sales revenue for the year was up 2.9% to AUD25.8 billion. Total income was up 1.2% to AUD26.6 billion, and EBITDA was down 3.5% to AUD10.7 billion. Reported a small increase in depreciation and amortization of 0.85% and net finance costs fell 28% or AUD268 million, AUD87 million of this was due to a combination of lower interest rates on reduced average gross debt and higher average cash balances, and the rest was due to a combination of lower debt market volatility and the implementation of accounting standard ISP 9 [ph].</p>
<p>Net profit after-tax from continuing operations was down 5.8% to AUD4.3 billion, while basically earnings per share was up 0.3% to AUD0.345. Reduction in EBITDA and net profit after-tax on a reported basis was used to a rising underlying performance offset by the effect of the CSL operating results and the one-off gain on the sale both in FY14. So on the guidance basis we exclude the AUD5611 million gains on sale of CSL in FY14 and exclude the impacts of M&amp;A activity. The space sales revenue for the year was up 1.9%, total income was up 2.3% and EBITDA was up 2%.</p>
<p>Our income and EBITDA on a guidance spaces and excluding sales of operating results in FY14 most closely represents our underlying performance, this is shown in the right hand column, on a guidance basis and excluding CSL operating results, income growth was 6.6% in FY15 and EBITDA growth was 4.5%.</p>
<p>We'll now move to our other main financial measures. CapEx was down 2% to AUD3.6 billion with slightly lower in FY15 due to the transit network build which was largely completed in FY14 as part of the infrastructure agreement with the NBN, and divestment of the census and the CSL businesses in the prior year. Our CapEx to sales ratio was consistent with our guidance of 13.9%. Our reported basis free cash flow is down from AUD7.5 billion in FY14 to AUD2.6 billion. Now FY14 include the one-off gross proceeds that's associated with the sale of CSL and census of AUD2.107 billion and AUD454 million respectively.</p>
<p>Free cash flow in FY15 included the outflows AUD1.3 billion invested in spectrum and AUD1.1 billion related to M&amp;A and associated transactions. On a guidance basis, our free cash flow was AUD5 billion The difference between free cash flow in reported and guidance basis in the current period was the AUD1.3 billion invested in spectrum and the AUD1.1 billion related to M&amp;A and associated transactions.</p>
<p>As Andy mentioned, the Board has declared a fully franked final dividend for FY15 of AUD0.155 per share, up 3.3% on the FY14 final dividend. This brings the total dividend for the 2015 financial year to AUD0.135 per share which is 3.4% higher than FY14, and a third dividend increase in two years. Our dividend policy remains unchanged and future dividends will be subject to the Board's normal semi-annual approval process and with our capital management framework that sets out a goal to seek to increase the dividend overtime based on growth in earnings per share on a sustainable basis.</p>
<p>Return on equity and return on invested capital both were in line with our low reported net profit after-tax, down two percentage points and 0.8 percentage points respectively, and gearing increase to 5.3 percentage points to 48.3% principally as a result of our investments in spectrum, M&amp;A, and the off-market buyback. Our credit metrics and balance sheet settings remain well within our targets zones we retain our strong liquidity position.</p>
<p>We'll turn now to income performance across our business units. In summary, we are seeing strong growth across our business units. Retail income was up 5.3% to AUD17.3 billion, consumable was up 6.5% to AUD12 billion dollars with growth in mobile and fixed data. Business was up 2.9% to AUD4.9 billion due to strong mobile postpaid, handheld and their sales latter benefiting from strategic acquisitions and strong performances across unified communications cloud. Global Enterprise and services income grew 7.9%; 3.3% domestically and 24.2% internationally.</p>
<p>Overall we saw strong performance across key major business lines. Domestically, our enterprise mobility business returned to growth and our NAS business grew strongly. Internationally, we expanded our geographical presence and base of enterprise and also our customers. Finally, Telstra wholesale income was up 11.1% to AUD2.6 billion largely due to an increased NBN infrastructure receipts from completion of the transit network, and from the excess stream in line with the NBN roll out.</p>
<p>I'll turn now to our sales revenue performance by product. We saw continued growth in FY15 with sales revenue up 2.9% to AUD25.8 billion on a reported basis. Ex-CSL and ex-M&amp;A basis, sales revenue grew at 6.3% and reported sales revenue was AUD1.045 billion of operating revenue from CSL in FY14, and the AUD255 million of sales revenue from controlled entities acquired in the current period. The slide shows the significant contribution made by our mobile, NAS, and international businesses all of which achieved double-digit revenue growth in FY15.</p>
<p>I'll turn now for product performance in detail starting with the fixed line portfolio. Overall fixed product revenue was down 1.9% for the year, fixed Voice revenue was down 7.1% which is the lowest rate of decline in the last five years. Retail fixed Voice customer line loss slowed marginally to AUD264,000 or 4.2% compared to AUD279,000 or 4.3% in FY14. This slowed line loss was assisted by marketing activity and lower offers and customer retention, roughly declined by 4.3%, the same rate of decline as in the previous year. Fixed data revenue grew 7.3% with retail fixed data revenue up 6.8%. Retail fixed broadband subscriptions grew by AUD189,000 to AUD3.1 million, we also saw a 1.1% improvement in ARPU fixed voice and fixed data had better first and second half revenue growth performance slowed down in the second half reflects increased competition.</p>
<p>Fixed voice margin fell by four points due to low revenues while the fixed data margin was flat. But fixed voice and data margins were negligibly [ph] affected by the cost of connecting customers to the NBN and the ongoing NBN phase. As of June 30, 2015, we had 211,000 NBN connections made up of 161,000 voice and data bundles, 9,000 data-only services and 41,000 voice-only services. Finally, we continue to see some growth in retail bundles with customers up 280,000 to 2.2 million, this represents 7.1% of our retail fixed data customer base. Growth was partly due to the popularity of the new entertainer bundles released in May 2014, further entertainment office in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Turning to our mobiles performance. Overall mobile revenue growth 10.2% with services revenue 7.2% higher due to growth in handheld ARPU and subscriber growth, and postpaid handheld revenue was up 7.7% due to customer and ARPU growth, postpaid handled ARPU excluding MRO was up AUD2.94 in FY14 to AUD69.51 in FY15. Have the second half postpaid ARPU is not a strong falling 63% since on the first half as a result of higher data allowances, lower exist data rates, full time data alerts and reduced prices on international roaming. Prepaid handhold revenues grew 13.1% due to increased data usage and recharge values and 3.5% increase the number of unique users. Mobile broadband revenue was flat plus machine-to-machine revenue grew at 11.9%. The EBITDA margin in 2015 was 40%, the same as 2014. The positive influences on margin were ARPU and operational leverage later offset by increasing recontracting costs.</p>
<p>Looking at the half years, the first and second half EBITDA margins were up by 40%, one would normally expect some second half rise, second half was influenced by the lower ARPU just mentioned. During the year we added a further 664,000 domestic retail mobile subscribers including 113,000 postpaid handheld customers to bring our total subscriber base to 16.7 million. We saw an increase in churn year-over-year to 11.5%, however, the second half churn was lower than the first.</p>
<p>I'll turn now to data and IP. Here we saw revenue decline of 2.9% as customer breakation [ph] from legacy products onto IP solutions continued. While we are achieving volume growth on IP access, we are still seeing some price competition. IP excess revenue, nonetheless, grew 1.2% because of an increase in customer connections. IP main revenue reps which represents 67% of IP access was up 6.8% with connections up 6.1% reflecting customer wins, the demand for scalable high bandwidth. Slower ISDM declines the results of an excess line reduction of 7.2% and 1.2% decline in ARPU, the line reduction was a result of customer migration to unified communications and fixed data products. Finally, across the portfolio our EBITDA margins of 64% were modestly impacted by yield pressures in the IP market.</p>
<p>Turning now to network applications and services. In NAS space was a third consecutive year of revenue growth in excess of 20%. NAS revenue was up 23.2% to AUD2.4 billion. We saw a strong growth across all major NAS product categories due to existing and new contracts with plays in contributions from recent acquisitions. NAS network services grew by 21.8% due to increased professional service and security activity, including growth from our recent acquisitions, O2 and Bridgepoint. Cross-managed network services and unified communications, our enterprise customers are adopting standardized offerings to a much higher degree influencing improved speed, quality, and reliability for our customers and lower costs.</p>
<p>Unified Communications revenue was up 8.1% as a result of increased IP telephony customers' connections and cloud revenue grew 33% percent to infrastructure and data services software as a service and professional services. Industry solutions revenue growth of 41.6% was principally due to increased NBN commercial works and contributions from Telstra SNP monitoring. From a segment perspective we saw particularly strong growth in the business sector, up 37.9% to AUD553 million and just domestic up 18.4% to AUD1.8 billion. As we start to build out our capabilities in Asia, the same strong growth albeit of a low base with international NAS revenues up 41.4% benefiting from weaker Australian dollar during the year.</p>
<p>As we continue to grow the NAS portfolio we're also focused on improving profitability. NAS profitability margin continues its trend of improvement in FY15 influenced by the scalable standardized offerings, a low cost delivery model, and operational leverage. We remain confident that the NAS portfolio will generate a return on invested capital above our cost-of-capital, on top of this NAS plays a valuable role in complementing our carriage business. As indicated in our first half '15 results, we'll take you through our NAS business at its profit and returns at our October Investor Day.</p>
<p>Turning now to Media and Foxtel. We'll start with Foxtel. The revenue growth was 1.9%, customer subscriptions revenue growth was 2.4%, this was partly offset by lower advertising revenue. EBITDA decreased 8.2% due to higher programming, marketing and other support costs associated with new pricing and packages launched in November 2014. Investment in Presto and Foxtel's launch of triple-play bundles. The 12.7% decline in EBIT reflects the EBITDA decline and the steady level of depreciation and amortization. Total subscribers were 8.6% or 227,000 to 2.8 million. The strong growth was underpinned by the new pricing and packages, lower churn and Telstra entertainment and bundles. It's worth noting Foxtel's second half subscriber growth of 180,000 was particularly strong but also supported by Presto and the launch of the new Set Top Box IQ3.</p>
<p>Churn improved by a further 1.6 percentage points to 10.9%, churns continued to reduce from 14.2% in 2013 to 12.5% in 2014 to 10.9% in 2015. And Telstra's books for distribution received from Foxtel was down 24.2% to AUD125 million reflecting our contribution to Foxtel's recently announced investment in Channel Ten, revenue was relatively flat at AUD118 million dollars.</p>
<p>Moving to our other media assets. It's live shows and improved performance in those media assets, Foxtel from Telstra grew by 9.4% to AUD662 million and subscribers grew by 18.4% year-on-year to 623,000. This growth was due to the increased take up for the Telstra into China bundles. The change in Foxtel pricing has had the following effects, lower entry prices enabled us to deliver more mass market Foxtel from Telstra proposition which has helped broadband and voice sales. Some customers elected lower cost packages and more customers who appreciate the increase in content at every price point. These changes combined with marketing and channeled efforts has helped to deliver both revenue and subscriber growth.</p>
<p>The shift in focus towards Foxtel premium in our bundle offers has impacted IP TV revenues which are down 23.4% reflecting lower T-Box sales in the period. Excluding revenue from T-Box sales, IPTV revenue grew 19.6% reflecting the 19.5% growth in Foxtel on T-Box and export subscribers. Mobility and other content revenues were down 2.5% because of a decline in legacy feature phone services offset by increasing take up of NRL and AFL.</p>
<p>Turning now to international. We've divested our interest in CSL in May 2014, we exclude CSL international revenue grew at 29.9% in local currency terms. The churned media growth is mainly due to O2 home [ph] comment on in the next slide. Global connectivity was up 14.8% on a local currency basis as a result of continued increase in wholesale carrier data and growth of retail IP solutions. Global connectivity includes most of the revenue from our recently acquired Pacnet business.</p>
<p>International NAS revenue was up 38.9% in local currency to AUD99 million. Relating to Pacnet, we completed the acquisition in April 2015. Pacnet provides connectivity, managed services, and data center services to carriers not our national corporations and governments in Asia, and will substantially extend our reach and asset base in the region. Accounting and integration process were on-track to deliver previously announced cost synergies and use this asset to accelerate our growth and global connectivity in NAS.</p>
<p>Turning now to auto home, this slide highlights the performance back controlled into the auto home. Our current shareholding in Auto Home is 54.3%. During the year we completed a sale of 6.4% of our interest in Auto Home for AUD333 million, an average share price of $42 bringing our net residual cost base investment down below zero to below zero. Auto Home has continued to perform very strongly with revenue growth in local currency, up 79.3% or EBITDA growth of 48.4%. In Australian dollar terms revenue was AUD495 million and EBITDA was AUD212 million. Revenue growth was because of deeper penetration into existing markets and expansion into more Chinese cities. This growth was supported by an exclusive 12-months partnership with leading Chinese search engine Baidu that commenced in July 2014.</p>
<p>To the leading indicators of business activity include dealer subscription services, an average daily unique visitors who accessed Auto Homes, mobile websites, and mobile applications. These leading indicators were both up strongly with dealer sums of 37.1% to approximately 19,000, an and average daily unique visitors, up in total to 88.5% to 9.8 million.</p>
<p>Turning to income from the NBN definitive agreements or DA. During the year we recognized NBN DA related income of AUD811 million, up 26.7%. This includes strong revenue – strong growth in income and the ISA and PSAA which were up 63.3% and 147% respectively due to the completion of the churns, network build, and increased progress of the NBN roll out. Revenue for the commonwealth agreements reduced 49% following full recognition of the information campaign and migration date in the prior period. Within the Commonwealth agreements retraining deed revenues of approximately $10 million per annum will continue to be recognized over the next three to four years.</p>
<p>The NBN DA income represented on this slide was recognized across sales revenue and other income categories in our financial statements, sales revenue included NBN DA revenue relating to the infrastructure excess payments from the ISA and the prior period. Sales revenue also included the information campaign and migration deed. Other income included the remainder of the NBN DA income including all income from the PSDAA. Also highlight that NBN DA income doesn't represent all of the income that we receive from NBN Co. Outside the NBN definitive agreements, we also receive industry solutions revenue through the two commercial arrangements; the planning design services agreement and the joint deployment works contract. We receive additional sales revenue for wholesale Ethernet transmission and facilities access.</p>
<p>Let me turn now to our expenses. Term expenses increased 4.6% to AUD15.9 on a reported basis, this can been seen in the right hand bar. Ex-CSL ex-M&amp;A basis, expenses grew at 8%. This 8% increase in expenses compares to 6.6% income growth on the same basis, this can be seen in the grey bar on the right hand side. The productivity and simplification program for FY15 delivered another AUD525 million of expense benefits broadly in line with the prior year of AUD550 million. Proactivity is shown in the light blue bars under core and new business. The expense benefits were achieved across all our business units and in many cases were the result of digitalization and simplification of our products and processes which led to better outcomes for our customers as well as cost benefits. Our productivity program has enabled us to reinvest in the business.</p>
<p>We'll now break down the 8% expense growth in the following slide. I think of the operating expenses in the following way; firstly, in the core our directly variable costs, or DVCs, these are direct costs of funding growth in the core business but these costs were less concerned about their growth who are very concerned for their efficiency. This means they should be directly matched with revenue or they should be strong linked to business growth EG services revenue and costs. Growth in our DVC expense was the largest contributor to the overall increase in expenses representing about five percentage points of the 8% increase. DVCs grew at low teens percent.</p>
<p>The three biggest contributors to the increase in DVCs where mobile where we saw revenue growth of 10.2% and half of the revenue growth of 26.3%. NAS, where we saw revenue growth of 23.2% including margin expansion, and Foxtel services fees where we saw revenue growth of 9.4%. So where we saw the largest increase in our expenses, this increase directly supported our fastest growth categories in the core. Secondly, expenditure on our new growth businesses at the top. Increase in these expenses accounted for over 1.5 percentage points of the 8% growth, this category had the highest percentage increase of the three categories. These expenses supported the 61.1% growth in Chinese digital media revenue including Auto Home and growth in health and the Telstra software group. Thirdly, our core business excluding DVCs, our aim in these expenses is to use productivity approaches to offset underlying growth and inflation wages and volumes. This category consists of less than 1.5 points of the 8% increase in expenses as percentage growth was in the low single-digits. This also include the benefit in reduction in other cost related to favorable changes in applying ISP-119.</p>
<p>To summarize on expenses, the largest contributor to the 8% increase in our expenses was growth in DVCs which directly supported our fastest growing businesses in the core. We chose to invest in our growth businesses and growth in our core non-DVC expenses was within our expectations with productivity dampening underlying growth.</p>
<p>Turning now to capital and portfolio management. The stated framework that we use for capital management which we presented to the market more than three years ago remains that against which we make all capital decisions. The framework has the joint objectives of maximizing returns for shareholders, maintaining our financial strength and retaining financial flexibility, particularly for investment in future growth. In this regard we continue to manage the balance sheet consistent with a single A credit rating. A solid operating performance, we ended the year with a cumulative excess free cash flow of AUD2.8 billion. This was after financing acquisitions which were in excess of AUD1.1 billion in FY15.</p>
<p>Before moving to some of our major acquisitions investments, let me take you over to highlight some of our key achievements that are contributed towards shareholder value creation in FY15. We raised $1 billion in March providing us with additional debt funding diversification, and all-in fixed Australian dollar coupon of full 27%. Auto Home also a conductor primary and secondary offering with the issuance and sale of shares rising AUD116 million and AUD333 million respectively for Auto Home and Telstra. So we just announced the Board has declared a further increase to our dividend to bring the total dividend for the year to AUD0.305, fully franked a 3.4% on the prior year. This represents AUD3.7 billion paid to shareholders in dividends in FY15.</p>
<p>We also completed the $1 billion buyback during the year which was executed at share price of $4.60. In addition, we've reactivated our Dividend Reinvestment Program which is upright for FY15 but final dividend payment to be paid on the September 25. The election date for participation of DRP is August 20, 2015. This reactivation follows continued engagement with our shareholders, primarily our retail shareholders feedback is important to us. DRP means that shareholders can choose to reinvest their dividends directly into shares rather than receive a cash payment. We tend to purchase shares on market to satisfy the DRP relation to the 2015 final dividend, although we have the discretion to issue new shares in the future. For regulatory reasons, participation of the DRP will be limited to shareholders with registered addresses in Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<p>Turning to some of that major acquisitions and investments in FY15. In our core, we continue to invest to improve our capabilities and extending our capacity and presence in specific geographies, Pacnet is a good example of this. Other recent acquisitions in our core included Globecast, a media specific services and engineering provider; NATO, a digital commerce enabler; Bridgepoint, an information security and network integration provider. Our JV with Telkom Indonesia, Telecom Telstra launched on May 13, 2015, with a suite of managed solutions and domestic enterprises and multinationals operating in Indonesia.</p>
<p>Our software division, Nativ was added in June to our Ooyala and Video class acquisitions to build a leading global intelligent video platform. Just to held over last 18 months we have completed 15 acquisitions, investments and distribution agreements, built capabilities across the whole system including electronic prescription and spending, residential edged and community care software, possible information systems, telemedicine health analytics, and other solutions to help patients providers and health professionals connect more efficiently. We are currently integrating these acquisitions and implementing new solutions to play a part in bringing the benefits of digital to healthcare. Just we've identified invested in the technology trends in video and health, we continue to look for emerging trends in other areas. Through Telstra ventures, we continually searching for leading high growth emerging companies because that's where many innovations originate.</p>
<p>As Telstra becomes a world-class technology company, these investments in world-class innovation are important to our future. Our ventures team based in Silicon Valley, Australia and China have made nine new investments this year in companies with technologies in mobile apps, cloud-based solutions, security 5G mobile and range of other innovations. Ventures includes companies whose products many of your businesses are using today such as DocuSign, OX, NS Imperium [ph], for example.</p>
<p>Turning now to some of the more detailed capital of balance sheet movements in 2015. Overall, our balance sheet remains strong, our accrued CapEx for the year reduced 2% to AUD3.6 billion. Free cash flow in 2015 was down AUD7.5 billion in FY14 to AUD2.6 billion. Free cash flow in 2014 included the one-off proceeds from the sale of CSL and Sensis. Liquidity in FY15 was reduced to fund planned cash outflows such as the spectrum license payments of AUD1.3 billion, the buyback of AUD1 billion, the reduction in gross debt of AUD1 billion, and increased dividend of AUD3.7 billion, as well as to fund acquisitions.</p>
<p>Net debt increased to AUD13.6 billion, we've reduced our average borrowing cost and our gross debt to 5.8% with the closing year to 5.7%. We extended our average debt maturity from 4.7 years to 5 years. The reduction in our yield will continue to be slow up until 2017 when a higher coupon debt borrowed post GFC starts to mature. We've been refinancing at much lower rates as evidenced by our recent 10-year $1 billion issue in March which provides us with additional diversification of funding, and all-in fixed Australian dollar coupon of 4.27%.</p>
<p>Our gearing ratio at the start of FY15 was 43% following the sale of CSL and 70% stake of our Sensis directories business in FY14. This was below the low end of our target range in anticipation of significant planned outflows in the current year. Our gearing ratios increased to 48.3% at June 30, 2015 reflecting the increase in net debt. Broadly, all of our financial parameters remain at the conservative end of our target range to meet our criteria of a single A credit rating.</p>
<p>Finally, in relation to guidance. The guidance assumes wholesale product price stability and non-impairments to investments excludes any proceeds of the sale of businesses, ledges and acquisitions and purchases spectrum, CapEx to sales guidance excludes externally funded CapEx. A number of a coming of HA decisions that will potentially impact the wholesale prices and our FY16 reported results. The HA consulting a new access determinations including a draft determination on fixed line services. The draft fixed line services determination is of concern, we don't agree with the draft decision. We continue to make our position on this clear within the regulatory process. The draft decision were implemented from October, the EBITDA reduction in FY16 would be upto AUD90 million.</p>
<p>Coming back to guidance, in FY16 we expect to deliver mid-single digit income growth, and low single digit EBITDA growth. We expect to send CapEx at approximately 15% of sales. Lastly, we expect FY16 free cash flow to be in the range of AUD4.6 billion to AUD5.1 billion. Relative to FY15, FY16 free cash flow will be influenced by an increased level of CapEx-to-sales of 15% and total CapEx in excess of AUD4 billion to fund increased mobile network investment, a higher working capital partly due to increased receivables related to the timing of NBN amounts received under definitive agreements including the ISI and PSAA.</p>
<p>This is now the end of the finance section. Thank you. Now I'll hand back to Andy.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Penn</strong></p>
<p>Well, thanks very much Warwick for taking us through the results, and I think that very much that those results demonstrate that our strategy is working. Customer efficacy has improved, we continue to invest in and drive value from the core of our business, and we have laid the foundations for growth in the future. Now at October 2014 Investor Day we shared with you our key objectives for 2015 in line with the three pillars of our strategy, and what I like to do now is just take a couple of moments to spend some time looking at what we've achieved in 2015 in line with the strategy, and I'll address each of these in turn.</p>
<p>Now one of the key areas of focus in improving customer efficacy is of course getting service right first time, nothing more frustrating as a customer than not experiencing that. And the way you can get it right first time for the customer, they obviously have a much better experience but we also see productivity improvements as well, so it really is a win-win. And I'm pleased to say that we are getting it right first time more often than ever before. In fact, our first call resolution rate which is a key indicator because it measures the proportion of calls that are resolved in the first instance without there being a need for subsequent call to the same customer within a seven day period. First call resolution in our customer small business context census is now around 84% and that's a steady improvement from 73% three years ago.</p>
<p>Another initiative we introduced is designed to address a source of frustration for many customers, not just Telstra customers, and that is being able to be reconnected to the person that you first spoke with if you have a follow-up, and an initiative at Telstra which we call, you have my name. Everyday thousands of our customers receive the contact details of customer service agent that they spoke with and they can be reconnected with that service agent. It's a significant capability when you bear in mind that we receive more than 100,000 calls a day to our call centers. And since the launch of this initiative we've had over one million customers use the service. Of course, we know being more responsive to our customers also helps build efficacy and 2015 we reengineered the speed and quality of our response to consumer and small business customers, and as a result of that we've seen a 32% improvement in context sent to response times, and the average time that is taking to resolve a complaint has improved by 54%.</p>
<p>Responsiveness though is more about just dealing with today, it's also about anticipating and dissipating the needs and inviting solutions for the future, and we have begun working with our enterprising government customers to co-create technology solutions in a new model that best meets their needs. And New Customer Insight Center in Sydney and the existing one in Melbourne provides an ideal sitting for these sessions. They include workshop spaces, part in the pop-up installations, hand-on technology demonstrations, customer collaboration areas, all with the state-of-the-art technology connectivity and business technology solutions. Innovation is also important, and we also run our startup incubator, MeraDe [ph], here in Sydney which you heard about, and in addition to that we launched Grova, innovation lab in Melbourne just recently, and that will facilitate co-collaboration in-house technology to solve real customer challenges.</p>
<p>Turning to initiatives to innovate in billing and pricing. In November, we were the first to introduce data alerts for our mobile customers on a real-time basis. Typically across the industry data alerts are delayed up to a couple of days which is not very helpful if you're a customer that is actively using your service. We remain the only company in Australia to provide real-time alerts in the important postpaid sector. Real-time alerts that allow customers to better monitor their data usage. And in April we also made it possible for our mobile customers to reduce excess data charges with the simplicity of data top-ups when we introduced extra data feature. Customers now have the option to acquire additional data in one gigabyte blocks when they've reached their monthly data limit on over 1.2 million customers and they are using this service because ultimately customers value peace of mind and these measures significantly reduce the risk of unexpectedly hard bills.</p>
<p>Let me now turn to the second limb of our strategy, driving value from the core. Innovation in networking generic remains a key skill of Telstra and a key innovation, and is a key priority for us and thus continued in 2015. During the year we started to rollout small-cell technology to around 40 mobile sets, and as you heard me say earlier, we plan to extend this to another 750 during 2016. And it provides coverage in areas where it was not previously commercial to do so, so communities such as Shenzhen in Queensland, Blackwood in Victoria, are now enjoying the mobile coverage that they didn't have before. As 4G coverage now reaches 94% of the Australian population, and as I mentioned it's set to reach 99% this year. 4GX services is available in over 1,200 suburbs in towns.</p>
<p>In March, we also launched Telstra Mobile Protect providing customers with parental control over their child's mobile browsing, calling and messaging. And at our Investor Day in April this year, Mike Wright who leads our network businesses, spoke to you about LANES, LTE Advanced Network for Emergency and Enterprise Services, a technology that we have developed on our LTE network. This year we carried really critical service on LTE for the first time at the G20 in Queensland, providing dedicated performance and bandwidth with wireless connectivity. We think this particular technology has huge potential.</p>
<p>In broadband, we have created Australia's largest Wi-Fi network. We launched Telstra Air on June 30 following trials earlier in the year. It provides access to thousands of Wi-Fi hotspots in Australia and more than 16 million hotspots overseas, that's part of an Australian exclusive arrangement with the global Wi-Fi provider firm. Telstra Air gives our fixed broadband customers the ability to access their home fixed broadband allowance at any of our hotspots. The Telstra Air network already has over 3,500 public hotspots, and over 65,000 broadband customers have signed up to the service to enable their home as a home Wi-Fi as on the Telstra Wi-Fi network. We've also signed nine councils across the country to have public Wi-Fi partner program including regional and metro councils. So the Wi-Fi network will extend and expand significantly during 2016 and we believe this is a key value add to our broadband customers.</p>
<p>But in addition to the Wi-Fi network, we also during the year introduced free data top-ups to our consumer fixed broadband customers, and all customers have now received at least double their previous data allowances. We continue to upgrade the back hold capacity of our cable and idea throughout networks to mitigate against network congestion, and over the last two years we have improved service to more than 1.5 million IDEA cell customers and 250,000 cable customers. In addition, by the end of August 2015 we will have improved line stability for 2.2 million retail and wholesale IDEA cell customers.</p>
<p>Let me now add my comments to the productivity agenda which you heard from Warwick. As he has already outlined, we delivered AUD525 million in expense benefits during the year. These predominantly included expense benefits in the areas of increasing in the efficiency of our customer service delivery operations, across field and non-field, particularly for IDEA Cell installations, efficiencies in NAS to Scale standardized and deliver service and make them memo quickly, a reduction in core volumes through improvements in simplification of our product processes and systems, and the introduction of NBN self-installed kits which have reduced the number of truck rolls. We remain committed to our productivity and program, and in fact some want to increase the intensity of our focus on productivity, and in particular, looking at how we drive productivity into the bottom line results of Telstra.</p>
<p>Now in addition to driving value from the core of our business, the core of our business is also and does also remain an important source of growth, in particular I'm pleased to announce we're actually accelerating growth in our business sector in domestic business, for example, small-medium sized businesses are now embracing connected tablets, and the Telstra apps marketplace leverages this development, and includes cloud and security apps. We've introduced new apps to help customers mobilize this seldom field forces including apps such as Deputy DocuSign, Box and ShoeBox. So this is a really important area of potential growth for further growth for us in the future.</p>
<p>Turning to the third limb of our strategy, and in terms of building new growth businesses we are focused really on four key areas in the past 12 months. The first of these is continuing to grow our NAS business, as you've heard from Warwick. We'll have more to say about the economic model on NAS at the Investor Day in October but during the year, we grew NAS business in Australia and offshore and enabled new cloud partnerships with some of the world's largest cloud suppliers, companies such as Cisco, The VMware, SoftLayer which is a subsidiary of IBM. Our cloud revenue has increased in 2015 by 33% to AUD286 million. We also introduced a global delivery model into our NAS business and this allows us to offer repeatable customer solutions at Skyl [ph] and more efficiently.</p>
<p>These initiatives mean we have been able to expand the range of NAS services delivering innovative solution for customers and providing greater proximity to our international customers. The many awards we have won in our NAS business are a testament to the breadth and quality of our service. Just to mention a few over the past year, we received the Global Cisco Award for Collaboration Partner of the Year, we received the PolyCom Award for the Global Cloud Provider of the Year, and Frost &amp; Sullivan awarded us it's Asia Pacific Managed Services Provider of the Year Award in recognition of our expanded services and capabilities in the region.</p>
<p>Turning then to our investments in Asia. During the year we substantially expanded our network services, and as you heard from Warrick, in April we completed the acquisition of Pacnet which owns and operates one of the largest submarine cable networks across the region with 113 points of presence across 70 cities globally, as well as 29 interconnected data centers in 16 cities across Asia Pacific. Pacnet has substantially increased Telstra's scope of international connectivity assets, and has doubled the number of customers that we have in the region. The Pacnet business services joint venture in China is particularly exciting because it offers IP-VPN connectivity together with state-of-the-art data centers in ChenJing and ZhongXing. It enables us to provide same as service offering to our customers in and out of China, and I'm pleased to announce we've already signed up our first two major global customers.</p>
<p>And in May of course, we formally announced operations of our joint venture with Telkom Indonesia, Telecom Telstra. It provides a suite of many services and at the domestic enterprises and multinationals doing business in Indonesia. These include managed networks, software as a service, product such as Vesper, IP-Skype and Mandove [ph] which is providing digital media advertising. There is no doubt that our Asian business is growing in Skyle in size and revenue and reputation, and in fact, in the recent Gartner report, we were ranked number one for best submarine cable infrastructure in the region and a leader in Ethernet services. We will continue to look at investment opportunities that enable us to expand our services to customers in the Asia Pacific region and we will maintain a disciplined approach to portfolio management of our assets.</p>
<p>Turning into media we are committed to providing the best entertainment and products including subscription TV, streaming video, leading sport and news content. We see content as an important driver of growth as seen in the continued take up of IP TV and Pay TV particularly through our entertainment bundles. In July, we announced the launch of Telstra TV, the next generation of T-Box with a combination of Fredware, Catch Up TV and SWork [ph]. It will offer customers the three leading services; Presto, Stan and Netflix, alongside a significant selection of TV Catch Up services and the latest released movies from BigPond Movies. Telstra TV will add to Telstra's existing entertainment services which already include the T-Box and Foxtel from Telstra. This year we also saw a good growth in the number of weekly and annual subscriptions to Air in NRL and AFL Apps. The total number of NRL subscribers increased 51% and the total number of AFL subscribers increased by 14%. And finally of course as you will have just heard, we've also announced that we will give Australian music fans a great music experience as the only Telco in Australia to offer Apple music.</p>
<p>The last 12 months has seen considerable activity to support future growth and let me therefore turn to some of the longer term investments in the longer term initiatives that we're investing in. The first of course is Telstra's Health. During the year as I mentioned before, we formally launched Telstra Health which is aimed at supporting the technological transformation of the health industry in Australia. Health technologies now offer and include prescriptions, remote diagnostics, hospital information systems, and health informatics. We now support up to 750,000 electronic scripts per day through Fred IT's Script Exchange Service, Health Engine, Australia's largest online directory has seen an increase of 738,000 bookings in the last 12 months. Our recent joint venture with ReadyCare which is a GP Telemedicine Service that allows you to connect with a doctor through the phone or video and receive advice, treatment, diagnosis and prescriptions for many conditions that you would normally see a GP for.</p>
<p>The second longer term initiative is an intelligent video where we are building a significant platform using software and dieter analytics. Our investment in new Ooyala and its acquisition of Video Plaza and Nativ during the year will enable us to build out these video capabilities. It means Ooyala's technology stack now extends to video production, post-production, digital content services, broadcast planning, and media management, for both OTT and OnAir content.</p>
<p>Ooyala has more than 550 customers worldwide including top broadcasters and media companies on every continent. And those customers stream video and ads to more than 220 million unique users. Because innovation is an important part of our growth agenda, and our application programming interface or API platform was also launched in June, and this enables developers to innovate off of their systems and networks by using Air API's to create their own products. And we already have more than 4,000 developers signed up.</p>
<p>So 2015 has been a significant year for delivering against the three strategic pillars. Some of the examples that I've provided demonstrate how our strategy of improving customer efficacy, driving value from the core, and building new growth businesses have helped deliver today's results.</p>
<p>Let me summarize therefore before I open for questions. We have a clear vision to be a world-class technology company that empowers people to connect. We have a clear strategy that is continued to deliver. Customer efficacy has been improved, we continue to drive value from the core of our business, and we have laid the foundations for growth in our new businesses.</p>
<p>On a guidance basis which excludes the one of profit on the sale of CSL, total income excluding finance income increased 2.3% to AUD26.3 billion, EBITDA increased 2% to AUD10.8 billion, and net profit after-tax increased 9.8% to AUD4.4 billion. We also added as you heard from Warwick, significant shareholder value through effective capital and portfolio management. Looking ahead to 2016, we expect to deliver mid-single growth in income and low single-digit growth in EBITDA. And we expect free cash flow to be in the range of AUD4.6 million to AUD5.1 billion.</p>
<p>Thank you very much for your time this morning. That concludes our presentations. And Warwick and I will now be very pleased to take any questions you might have. Thank you.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>A - Peter Kopanidis</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Samir?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Samir Chopra</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Samir Chopra from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Congratulations on a strong top line performance. I had two questions one is you've articulated that your cumulative free cash flow is sitting at AUD2.8 billion and we can't see any sort of committed spend around the horizon like spectrum payments. So I was wondering what are your intentions with the AUD2.8 billion and additional cash flow if you could express a view there. And the second one is around operating leverage, margins in the business came down by about 2.5% year-on-year in the second half. And based on guidance for next year it looks like there is a little bit more pressure on EBITDA margins in the business. I was wondering if you could talk about where you're seeing this faster expense growth is which products, which cost categories? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much, Samir, and thanks for the acknowledgment of the strong top line performance. So, look in relation to cumulative free cash flow and investment program, as you know, I mean our number one priority is to look for opportunities where we can continue to invest for growth in the future. We recently announced we will increase CapEx to sales ratio, that's another AUD250 million dollars and there is in fact another spectrum auction later in the year with 1,800 spectrum coming up. But look, more importantly our focus is how do we invest for growth in the future. This year is demonstrated that there are significant opportunities to do so with many acquisitions that we've executed and so that will continue to be a strong focus.</p>
<p>On the second one on operating leverage, I'll mike in couple of comments and then I'll pass over to Warwick. I mean I think the key point is that we are focused on growing EBITDA at the aggregate level, one; and two, we are focused on growing the margins at the individual product level as well. Of course as time goes by and as that business continues to change and as we continue to expand, the profit margins on each individual products in the wider averages does actually affect the overall company level margin and that's one of dynamics that's occurring in 2015 but importantly, we will continue to focus on growing EBITDA at the aggregate level and also the underlying product margins for each of the individual products that we are focused on. Warwick, would you like to add a couple of comments, particularly also where we see productivity improvements in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>There is two things going on, the first is, we're very pleased with the dollar value of EBITDA increase, and then looking at the percentage EBITDA margin there is two things going on, there is a mix effect where some of the faster growing businesses are lower margin than some of that traditional businesses; and then there is margin changes in each of our businesses, and so sort of going through there we've seen mobile margin flat year-on-year whereas we've seen NAS margin improve. Then as I mentioned in the speech, if we sort of look at the overall corporation, we are really aimed – we are aiming at productivity in particular, is in that core business, exTV [ph].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Samir Chopra</span></strong></p>
<p>Just touch on the mix one because you've got more NBN contribution coming in next year, that's why we had expected that perhaps margins would be more stable?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>That would be one factor we have more – I mean, obviously the right pace of the rollout of NBN is a function of how NBN go with that but obviously as we migrate more business to NBN that has an impact on the product margins as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Samir Chopra</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Samir.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Kopanidis</span></strong></p>
<p>Ian?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ian Martin</span></strong></p>
<p>Ian Martin, analyst [ph]. Well done on the results, so far I guess we've heard of great business there and it's good to see you got the continuity going to continue those key trends and the contributions from most different business areas. Just on the fixed volume service. So the underlying EBITDA margin on fixed was an improvement, and I guess that would probably surprise a lot of people that we can improve that margin given the trends in that business and I guess the migration of NBN, were those offset by upfront cost and connecting NBN customers. Now those costs, are they related to connecting your own customers in which case you should be expected that will pick up quite significantly through the year ahead is the MTM strategy was played out by the NBN. Or is that related to just as broader responsibilities under the definitive agreements to help NBN connect customers in which case there is a matching issue here because cost of revenue is elsewhere.</p>
<p>And secondly, just a question on guidance. You've qualified that for the excess price issue, we see that applies out. I just want to note though, the actual procedure is a discount right there, less than 6% or quite a leverage cost of capital 6%, little bit under 6%. And I don't know if our gross cost of debt is actually about the same level, so there doesn't seem to be anything there for shareholders in that excess price regime. But my question really is around, you've got that qualification there but we're also going to see quite a substantial change in the NBN model this year, we haven't seen the NBN corporate plan, it's due out fairly soon I understand but it's likely to have quite a significant change in the model we've seen previously from NBN. Have you factored that into guidance as best you can or is that potentially another change of market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, thank you very much, Ian, and firstly thanks for your kind comments at the beginning. Look on fixed line, Warwick had a comment as well but to your point about NBN and activations in the cost of activation, it is more than – I think – come let me show you this, I think it's the former not the latter in the senses focused on activating our customers as we migrate customers, as we win customers in completing fall into the early sales.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ian Martin</span></strong></p>
<p>It's fairly substantial amount though isn't it for relatively small number of customers so far?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>We've had 221,000 NBN customers connected, so it's starting to become more material, and of course as everybody migrates to NBN, obviously the initial cost of migration is we're still working through what's the most efficient way to do that and NBN obviously have got their own plans to improve the efficiency off the rollout and so I would be confident that overtime on a pune [ph] basis, those costs will come down but you're right, they are higher than we would like them to be at the moment but specifically to your question it relates to migrating our customers or us winning customers – new NBN customers. And to your question about is that factored into guidance, yes that is factored into our considerations around guidance including the move to a multi-technology model, specifically in relation to your question.</p>
<p>I might just comment on the fixed access pricing determination that you just mentioned, and then I'll see if Warwick has something to add on that – on the fixed line point. Look, on the fixed axis price determination, firstly it's a draft decision. We do agree/disagree with quite strongly, and we've made submissions in relation to that and we would be hopeful that those would be taken into account because the one thing that we feel very strongly and we believe is in fact a core principle is that all the costs of providing the services shared fairly across the industry, and we don't believe that would occur if the decision was implemented as proposed. As regarding the weighted average cost of capital, I can only encourage you to go and speak to the ACCC about the weighted average cost of capital that they're using because we would have similar views.</p>
<p>Let me comment for you Warwick on the –</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Just on the margins, just to clarify the numbers, so our fixed voice margin fell four points and the fixed data margin was flat and then both of those – within both of those services, they were both negatively affected by the cost to connect customers to the NBN and the ongoing servicing cost of those customers on the NBN. I would however mention that our unit costs are improving and for that latter set of customers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ian Martin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ian.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig Wong-Pan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, it's Craig Wong-Pan from Deutsche Bank. First question just on your free cash flow guidance, the number or the range that you've guided was a little softer than what I was looking for, and the points that you mentioned about – I guess the drivers there, some of them would be your CapEx? There I was just sort of uncertain about the working capital that you mentioned around NBN, could you just kind of explain that? And then a second question on the mobile churn, good to see some sort of positive trends there with your annualized rights just coming down, could you just explain what you're seeing there are what do you think is kind of driving that churn rate?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, Warwick to this on.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>On free cash flow, the journey from EBITDA, that sort of is important to get from our guidance EBITDA to our guidance free cash flow. The first is, CapEx is higher this year than last year, and then the next part of it is working capital, there is two chances of that. The first is, as we receive money from the NBN, that's paid quarterly in arrears, and so there is a working capital implication of that. Secondly there is a growth in working capital implication from our business growing pretty fast, and that includes NAS and includes Mobile where we would expect more working capital there, it's just a timing thing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig Wong-Pan</span></strong></p>
<p>So would that reverse overtime as just sort of more kind of stable growth rate as I guess you're kind of get working capital released then?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, in theory one would expect that. On the churn –</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>In theory but in practice as we keep growing it's better if you can get to –</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Just as we accelerate. So on the churn, thanks for the comments about our churn, it is low relative to the – what we say, international peers, and you were replaced to say that it came down the second half but what's going on there is a tale of three different segments. A churn is actually lowest in the mass market segment and it's actually pretty rock steady and has been pretty rock steady. And so where we see a little bit more volatility in churn is in business customers and to some extent it's what's going on but some extent there is some churn that isn't really churn, so for instance employee leaving one company to another sort of thing, and that's what leads to a bit of the volatility.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig Wong-Pan</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Kopanidis</span></strong></p>
<p>Roger.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Roger Samuel</span></strong></p>
<p>Roger Samuel from CLSA. Two questions for you. First one, just looking at 5G mobile which is coming in 2020, I presume that you need to – you had spent some CapEx to prepare for 5G. So how much of your mobile CapEx which we increased recently is going to allocated to 5G? How much should we expect in the next three to five years in terms of CapEx spending for 5G? And second question is on the data an IP in business segment. We are seeing some small players such as VocusMCOM and CPG competing in that space, offering lower prices than Telstra. I'm just wondering how you see the competition and how would you respond?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much, Roger. Look on 5G, I mean as you just pointed out, most of the industry and the industry international bodies in the global board of the mobile operators really predict 5G being rolled out around 2020 and those of you that want to speak to Mark Wright, he is here, he leads Network Businesses and he is actively involved at a global level in some of these considerations and can certainly provide more color on that. But essentially what 5G is trying to sell forth is two things; one is, the very significant increasing demand for data as people use their services increasingly for content, and is content itself requires more data's removed to and 4G high-definition downloads and contents gaming that is driving enormous increase in the volume of data across the network. And I think globally it's something around 70% per annum which would not be inconsistent with what we experience, so that's one dynamic.</p>
<p>The second dynamic is this whole world of Internet of Things which really just refers to the fact that increasingly we're seeing devices connected as well as just phones and tablets, so cars, sensors, pieces of aeronautical equipment, engines, in fact you can imagine a world in 2020 where almost anything that could be connected will be connected in the dynamic with the Internet of Things as you've got a very significant number of devices connected on the one hand that perhaps many of them have actually got relatively learned out to use and actually low number of – or low times of connectivity. So 5G is trying to solve for those two things. There is a lot of technology innovation and development that's going on around the world at the moment to design that.</p>
<p>So to your specific point about how much is it going to impact our CapEx, well to be honest, it would be a little too early to predict that but it suffices to day we already invested very significantly in any cutting edge technology, that's why we are LT Advanced, why we are bringing LTE Broadcast, why we are bringing LTE Aggregation. So we will – we are and we will continue to be at the leading edge of technology innovation and add networks to basically support our aspiration to be a world-class technology company. So I don't think I can provide you any real color in terms of the numbers, it's a long way, that's where our 5G is hitting and I can assure you we are right at the center of the innovation at the cutting edge of those discussions.</p>
<p>On the data and IP question, the important point is that we are continuing to win customers in data and IP, there is competitive pricing in the market as there is in every aspect of that market but our strategy has been and will continue to be – you know we provide network application services and you heard me talk about the number of apps that we are in the app marketplace that we've actually starting to introduce to our business customers, small-medium sized businesses are starting to see, look at how they have leverage the cloud, how they can leverage technology to drive efficiencies in their business and we see that as an important opportunity for us. And we can provide the in conjunction with carriage-and-cool network connectivity because all of this technology innovation fundamentally relies on high quality reliable networks which is fundamentally the focus of our business. So we think we will price in that regard. Warwick, I'm not sure if there is anything you want to add on data and IP?</p>

<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>So as we've gone through each of the evolutions, 1G to 2G, 2G to 3G, and 3G to 4G, each of those evolutions has become simpler, and so 5G will be even simpler than 4G with much of the upgrade being software. And also many of the 5G advantages we're going to say along the way with the evolution to 4G. So it's more gradual again than 4G which was more gradual than 3G, and that's true about what we have today and the CapEx implication. And just the other thing is that with that all the things that we've been talking about within our medium term aspiration target of 14% CapEx to sales for overall Telstra.</p>

<p>We do have questions on the line. Your first question comes from Nathan Bailey, CBI [ph], go ahead please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Good day, guys. I was wondering if I could just deep delve into this guidance a little bit more, you've got low single-digit EBITDA growth, obviously you should be getting a fair bit of impact from additional NBN revenues. So presuming you get AUD300 million or AUD400 million of that, you're essentially saying the rest of the business will be flat but obviously there is other drivers of growth in there in terms of what you're doing around Pacnet and AMI and so forth. So I was wondering if you can probably give a little bit more color on how you get to the low single digit EBITDA growth and why you shouldn't be out any more than that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Nathan. Well, I get worried too add – as you say, we'll obviously get more revenues from NBN as NBN rolls out on the one hand, on the other hand we lose remember the margins as we migrate to NBN, that's fundamentally the key economic dynamic with NBN. And as you rightly point out, we are continuing to invest in new areas of growth in Pacnet, in international NAS, in our intelligent video platform in health business as well. So there is a number of areas where we're also continuing to invest and overall we expect low single digit growth as I mentioned in EBITDA which is pretty much the trend that we've seen over the last two, three, four years and what I would also say, which is important over the last two, three, four years is we've also meet our guidance and delivered on our guidance in every reporting period. Warwick is there anything else?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>No, there is nothing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I think that probably covers it. Thanks, Nathan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Kopanidis</span></strong></p>
<p>Next question please?</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Next question comes from Raymond Tong, Goldman Sachs. Go ahead please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Raymond Tong</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Andy, good morning, Warwick. Just a couple of questions, firstly on postpaid ARPU. Can you just talk about the drivers of the growth and the 1% decline sequentially and what do you – your expectations for growth into FY16? And just secondly on productivity, what are the key areas you see in the core business as opportunities to drive cost out in the next two to three years? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Penn</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Raymond. Look what I'll do is, I'll take the productivity one first and then make a quick comment on – a more sort of strategic level and then I'll ask Warwick can actually talk to the specifics of what affected ARPU in the second half of 2015. I mean on productivity, can I just reaffirm that I am more committed to productivity, I'm going to lift the bar on productivity, not lower the bar. So it is very much frontend center for us, we've had a significant productivity program in place for the last three or four years. We're driving a lot more accountability into the line, in fact some of the organizational changes that we are making is about actually taking the productivity program closer to the line executives so they have more control over it.</p>
<p>In terms of the areas that we see for improvement, obviously there's multiple areas across the business, but fundamentally it's about process improvement. It's around digitization. It's around streamlining delivery, audit, activations to customers. We talked a little bit with Ian Martin before about NBN activation. I think there are a range of areas and opportunities for continued productivity.</p>
<p>What's important is everywhere I look and see opportunities to improve our net promoter score and our service to customer is actually also where we see opportunities for productivity improvement. I mentioned before, first time call resolution now at 84% is a good win for the customer and it's a good win for us. There's no shortage of opportunity.</p>
<p>In relation to ARPU, as I say Warwick can talk to us a little bit about the second half. Fundamentally I can't predict where ARPUs will go at a market level in the second half. What I can say is that we have the best mobile business in Australia and we have mobile leadership and we're absolutely determined to continue invest to maintain that mobile leadership. That's what we're focused on doing.</p>
<p>I've announced that we're going to increase our level of capital investment in the network. We're very prepared to increase it again and do what we need to do to continue to ensure that we have mobile leadership. If that impacts ARPU, if that impacts margins, well that's what will happen. But we're very confident that's the right strategy for the longer term. Warwick, do you want to talk specifically about a couple of the ARPU points?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, just to add to that, so sequentially second half ARPU had a decline on first half ARPU. Four factors that went into that were more generous data allowances. They were extra data plans, so when customer gets to the end of their allowance they can get an extra Gig of data for AUD10, under real time alerts. There was also continued roll out of our international roaming travel pass. So they affected ARPU in the short term.</p>
<p>I'll note that the other side of that coin is that they're great for our customers. They were an important part of that five point increase in advocacy that we've reported. We're certainly not going to guide on ARPU, but some of the challenges and influences and opportunities for us on ARPU, probably the biggest one is now that we really are in a situation where our customers have got worry free use of data, the opportunity for us is to promote more heavily the use of extra data through both promotion and content.</p>
<p>Other opportunities are value added services in mass markets, such as StayConnected, to help our customers when they lose or break a device. Also, in our business segments there's great opportunities through value added services like mobile device management, mobile application management and some vertical solutions. All of those are ARPU opportunities for us and good for our customers.</p>

<p>Thank you your next question comes from Eric Choi, UBS. Go ahead please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Choi</span></strong></p>
<p>The first question was just on NBN payments now that the PSA payments are beginning to ramp up and become a more meaningful contributor. I was wondering if you could give us an idea of the underlying number of disconnections that the AUD163 million was booked against just to help with our forecasting?</p>
<p>The second question was just on guidance. Just wondering if there was a degree of conservatism in that AUD90 million wholesale price impact? Just based on your TEM disclosure it looks like the AUD90 million is based on applying a flat 10% reduction across the whole wholesale revenue base. Just wondering if the impact is slightly less once you take into account commercially negotiated agreeance?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>Well we haven't disclosed separately the NBN payment numbers, but I think that you can separately, from NBN, get their number of connections, which I think the last numbers I saw excluding satellite was around about 440,000. And you can -- from our reports, get the number of 220,000 or just over 220,000 as the number of NBN connections that we have. I'll let you do your own maths and triangulation. That information is all publicly disclosed. We haven't said more than that. But hopefully that's helpful.</p>
<p>On the fixed access decision, first point to make as I mentioned before is it's a draft decision and not final yet. We don't agree with the decision and we will be making -- have made submissions in relation to it, because our strong view is that the cost of the network -- which is in fact exactly what the principle say -- the cost of providing the network should be shared equally amongst all providers. This decision would leave that not to be the case.</p>
<p>The estimate of AUD90 million is our estimate -- well it's up to AUD90 million is what we said. That is our estimate, but we would be optimistic that the ACCC will see our submission and other submissions -- the submission from government, and make the appropriate adjustments so there's not that impact on Telstra shareholders.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Choi</span></strong></p>
<p>Can I just follow up on that NBN question. We've done that exercise where you compare the weekly rollout numbers. The difficulty is the implied payment per household number moves around quite a lot. I assume the difference is due to accounting recognition differences depending on how you guys treat it and how much of the Brownfield versus Greenfield connections that you [indiscernible] payment. I'm just wondering if that's the right way to think about it or whether it is actually quite a good gauge of -- for the PSAA?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, I'm not sure I can help you anymore Eric. I think I've given you as much triangulation as I could. So you're right, obviously there's some accounting issues and there's some timing of payment issues, that sort of thing, but I don't think they're material in the scheme of things. But I'm sorry I can't help you any further. Thanks Eric.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, your next question comes from Fraser Mcleish, Credit Suisse. Go ahead please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fraser Mcleish</span></strong></p>
<p>Two from me, firstly Warwick, just on mobile margins, I think at the investor day a few months ago you were talking about high 30s mobile margins was your expectation. You've just delivered another 40. Just wondering if that high 30s still stands? My second question, I guess, Andy strategically how you're thinking about managing the customer growth ARPU within mobile. You're in a more competitive environment. You've obviously had another great mobile revenue growth, but the post-paid subs ads was the slowest it's been for a while. I mean, are you willing to see post-paid subs in particular backwards or even down if it means protecting ARPU and protecting revenue? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>I might start with the second part of your question first. Then Warwick can comment also on the margins. I think the strategic point is the right place to start. As I mentioned a moment ago, we feel and we have the leading mobile business in Australia. We're determined to continue to invest in that position and ensure that that is the case. And as I said, I announced an increase in the CapEx to ensure we've got network leadership, and if we need to invest more we will. We think that will deliver the sort of continued leadership that we currently experience.</p>
<p>And then in the more competitive dynamics we've been, as I mentioned before, all of our fixed broadband customers have had more data allowances. In the mobile sector we've been increasing data allowances as well. We've changed the way in which customers can acquire data and our data alerts. So we are very active in that market. Over the longer term we've always had the view that given the nature of our business and the quality of our business we should be targeting EBITDA margins in the high 30s. Nothing has changed in that regard, however, as I said a moment ago, we will continue to invest and do whatever we need to do to maintain our mobile leadership position. If that impacts margins, if that impacts revenue or if that has impacts in the short to medium term, well so be it.</p>
<p>We think the right strategic thing to do is to continue to invest in the mobiles business, because we believe that the quality of the network in conjunction with the quality of the product and the service enables us to continue to deliver what customers want most, which is a great mobile service. Warwick, do you want to add any further comments?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, two comments on the margin. Just the first one, it's important to look at the dollar contribution of the growth in the mobile EBITDA as well. Mobiles EBITDA increased AUD371 million year-on-year which was and so it was the biggest contributor to Telstra Corporation's overall EBITDA growth. Also the EBITDA in percentage terms was up 9.6%, so just putting that to one side. In terms of the percentage margin, the origin of that comment about high 30s was a couple of years ago, and we were asked that in the context that our EBIT to margin had risen from the low 30s to the high 30s. The question was asked in the context, would that still keep going into the mid-40s. Ours was, no, it's more like the high 30s. It wasn't meant to distinguish between high-30s and 40.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>But we do believe that's the right margin over the longer term.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Sachin Gupta from Nomura. Go ahead, please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sachin Gupta</span></strong></p>
<p>Just on the guidance again, I was just wondering is it possible to talk about your expectations for the mobile business, given some of the competition issues and also, NAS, NAS domestic and NAS offshore for 2016. And Andy, just on the Asian aspirations, there's been a bit of discussion up here that Telstra may be looking to partner with SMC in the Philippines on their 4G rollout. Is that the market of a partner you think is compelling enough for Telstra, and what would the thought process there, please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>Well look, on the last point about Asian aspirations, Asia is an important region of focus for us. We've demonstrated that through our investment in Pacnet this year, through the launch of the Telkomtelstra joint venture in Indonesia. I can't unfortunately comment any -- on any particular sort of specific speculation on particular markets so I can't add any more to your question there in relation to the Philippines, other than to say Asia is an important area of investment for us.</p>
<p>On the mobiles business and on NAS and so we've discussed a little bit this morning our guidance for 2016, which takes into account the current dynamics as we know them in the market. But as I said before, we're very committed to continuing to grow our mobiles business. We think there's a great opportunity to do so. We saw very, very strong growth in revenue, almost 10% or I think around 10% growth in mobile revenue, this year including 7% plus in the services revenue. So I'm not sure I can say much beyond that, and NAS also continues to be a very important source of growth for us. In fact, in the context of NAS, our services revenues now almost equal our carriage revenues for our enterprise, government and business customers. So that business is now a AUD2.4 billion business, so we're going to talk a little bit more about the strategy for the business and the economic model for the business at our investor day in October.</p>
<p>But as Warwick mentioned a moment ago -- he might want to comment again -- we're also focusing on the profitability of that business and looking to improve margins as we continue to scale up and grow. So Warwick, anything else to add?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'll add on that mobile business is, Sachin, good morning. You mentioned about competition which is very important. We do think of the mobile business both in terms of competition and growing the market, and so we are very focused on both. So on growing the market, what you'll see is a lot of work that we'll be doing in encouraging usage in the mass market and also value added services. Also on the business side of things, we grow the market with connected tablets. We grow the market with enterprise applications and enterprise managed services.</p>
<p>In terms of competition, and the -- what we're doing there is we have got the big new investment, or continued investment in the network, continued improvement in customer service and we're putting a lot of value into our mobile prices as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Kopanidis</span></strong></p>
<p>We'll take our last question from Justin Diddams from Citi.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Diddams</span></strong></p>
<p>So just a couple of questions from me, the first one, just on the mobile business so I think applying that margin to the revenue number sees a cost base of AUD6.4 billion. I was wondering if you can give us an indication of what percentage of that is actually mobile handsets to give us an idea of how much you're already subsidizing consumers in terms of handset payments?</p>
<p>The second question would just be on Foxtel. With the new set top box that you're going to be running, is that going to take primary space in terms of marketing and bundling from Telstra, and will Foxtel be taking a backward seat in terms of that bundling position? Then finally, just a follow up on that NAS question. I seem to recall you've said before, the key for NAS is building those initial platforms and structures, and then you're able to leverage those going forward. So should we expect some fairly significant earnings contribution from NAS, given you've done all the -- well you've certainly done a lot of investment upfront? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>Why don't I get Warwick to comment on mobiles and NAS, and then I'll make a comment on Telstra TV, which I'm very excited about.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, on the mobile hardware, here are some of the effects that have been going on. The first is you can see what's going on with the hardware revenue in the mobile slide we put up there. Now, our hardware costs are higher than our hardware revenues, like all operators. In terms of what went on in FY '15, there were three effects. The first is that we had price rises from our major suppliers and we pretty much passed those through to our customers. So hardware revenues and hardware costs went up exactly matched on that first effect.</p>
<p>The second thing is there were more recontracting events in FY '15 than in the previous year. The third was that the subsidy per event went up a bit as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, on Foxtel Justin, the answer is simply no. Basically, what Telstra TV enables us to do is actually help expand the market and grow the market for content because, as you know penetration, pay TV penetration in Australia is only around 30% at the moment, in Australia. We think there's a great opportunity to grow that. Foxtel's a very important partner to us and we work very closely with them in supporting them in terms of growing their business as well.</p>
<p>But Telstra TV enables us to bring a really simple to use set top -- it's not so much a set top box, it's a device that you can bring into the home. Basically, you get immediate access to all of the [indiscernible] services in Australia, Presto, Stan and Netflix in conjunction with a lot of other catch-up TV and other services. Easy to install, easy to use, only available to Telstra broadband customers. We think it's another initiative that will actually help add value to overall broadband services and actually in fact grow the market overall and will complement what we're also doing with Foxtel as well, which is working very closely. So we're very excited about that initiative, so thanks Justin -- as we are about the Apple Music launch a couple of weeks ago too.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Diddams</span></strong></p>
<p>There was a question on NAS as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry, did we miss the question on NAS in all that, in my excitement about Foxtel?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Diddams</span></strong></p>
<p>You did.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Pennsylvania</span></strong></p>
<p>Do you want to -- the question on NAS was when we will start to see some significant growth in earnings, so you might just want to comment on what we're doing on the economics.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Warwick Bray</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so we'll be talking you through the economics in our October Investor Day. We continue to see a strong line of sight to the NAS business on a stand-alone basis, earning a return on invested capital above the cost of capital, as well -- and that's on a stand-alone basis. As well as that, it does complement our carriage business as well but we'll go into the details of that in October.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Kopanidis</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Justin. Thank you everybody for your attendance, thanks for your questions. That closes today's session. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Pennsylvania</strong></p>
