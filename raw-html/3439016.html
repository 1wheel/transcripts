  <p><strong>Tammy Jackson</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, and welcome to Sonic Foundry’s 2015 Third Quarter Earnings Presentation. I am Tammy Jackson and I will be moderating today’s webcast. At any time during the presentation you can click the Ask button to pose a question. If you don’t see it please hit refresh and you’ll see it at the bottom of your screen. We’ll begin with the Safe Harbor statements and then take Q&amp;A after the prepared remarks.</p>

<p><strong>Ken Minor</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you, Tammy. And thank you for joining us today, this afternoon. I'll begin by going through a few of the financial highlights and trends. Our consolidated billings decreased approximately $600,000 from the prior year which is about 5%. Our product and other billings decreased 10% the support maintenance showing 11% increase over the prior year. And our events business showing 10% decrease.</p>
<p>Our billings comparisons reflect significant billings to both Leeds University, as well as NYU during the third quarter last year, which totaled $1.9 million. We do have another near term international opportunities approximately equal to that of both the Leeds and NYU opportunity. But the timing of the Ramadan holiday made that impossible to complete during the third quarter. We do expect to complete that during the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Some of the additional comparisons, so first of all revenue line items tracked very similarly to that of billings. Within the quarter revenue during the third quarter of this year for the Kuwait shipment that we shipped in Q2 of this year. Similarly, we recorded revenue in Q3 of last year partnership been made to Leeds in the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Gross margin rates vary from quarter-to-quarter based on mix and the large transactions in both the June quarters, end of this year and last year we’re impacted by high volume transactions reported due impart that reporting like Kuwait transaction this year and as well as the second quarter, Leeds shipment last year.</p>
<p>This year was also impacted by a significant increase in refresh units that were shipped during the quarter. As well as other incentive price transactions neither of these are events that we expect to happen in Q4. Quarterly I do expect to see Q4 gross margins increased from end of Q3 and then full year gross margins will approximately last year’s gross margin rates. Our operating expenses were consistent with last year, so with the reduction and margin dollars we ended up in a loss of this quarter of 9,000 or 21,000 or $0.21 per basic and diluted share.</p>
<p>Our cash was down from last year but consistent with the prior second quarter. Cash reflected reduction in our line of credit in total of about $1 million this quarter and also reflected $1.5 million increase in a new note payable to Partners for Growth that we announced in May, as well as of course normal debt payments and investments in capital equipment. Our adjusted EBITDA per share is a good approximation, the cash impact of our operations, this adjust for non-cash depreciation as well as stock compensation. In addition our unearned revenue decreased by nearly $600,000 during the quarter, which is build and collect in the near term.</p>
<p>So that further improves our near term liquidity. Our ASP does reflect a significant decrease this period over the same period last year, which is an impact of the high demand that we saw for our lower price product that we came out with the quarter go. The Kuwait transaction was the largest component of that lower cost of product that we shipped during recorded revenue during this quarter. The lower ASP was also impacted by that significant increase in refresh units I mentioned, refresh units increased to 54% year-over-year. Our total units shipped increased 16% over the prior period last year, and our operating expenses were pretty flat this last year with sales and marketing showing a 2% increase due primary to slightly higher compensation rates.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses decreased about $140,000 or 8% due to a decrease of more than $450,000 in professional fees which was partially offset by an increase in compensation rates as well as some higher facility costs.</p>
<p>Our product development increased to $196,000 which is a 14% increased over the prior year, this due to some higher wage rates as well as more outsourced labor projects for near term engineering projects such as Join I will be talking about more today.</p>
<p>In terms of our balance sheet our current assets deceased $463,000 over since the fiscal year end September 30 of last year, is due to a decrease in cash primarily which was partially offset by an increased rather in accounts receivable.</p>
<p>Our capital acquisitions have been trending well below the rate of depreciation this year, so our fixed assets decreased $345,000, our intangibles reflect, amortization as well as a change in currency, since much of our intangibles now are reflected in both yen as well as the euro.</p>
<p>Our current liabilities were impacted by a reduction in the debt due to the sellers in Mediasite KK as well as MediaMission that was paid as well in December as well as January of last year. We had nearly an offsetting increase in our line of credit of $1.25 million this period as well as the current portion of the note payable I’ve mentioned a moment ago with Partners for Growth.</p>
<p>The long-term debt likewise increased because of the refinancing of our bank debt as well as the long-term portion of the note payable for Partners for Growth.</p>
<p>So at this point, I’d like to turn the presentation over to Gary, who will walk us through a few of the business trends.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Weis</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ken and good afternoon, everyone. Let me jump in to this and talk about large opportunities billings, large deals for billings, if you look at Q2 and Q3, you see the very large deals that consist of Leeds spread over the two quarters and NYU in the third quarter, Ken already mentioned that in terms of having a significant impact on our billings and revenue last year. This quarter we have a several large deals over about $300,000 went over $500,000. The biggest one was for the community, for the state colleges of Chicago, in fact one campus and offer next campus, we view that relationship is potentially becoming strategic in the future as more campuses adopted Mediasite technology. The second largest deal was the first shipment of product to Neusoft in China, they are distribution agreement, as we described on the call last quarter there would be a continuing source of billings and revenue for us. The other three that show on the chart were other principally large North American unit opportunities have closed.</p>
<p>Chart exactly the same as the one that we showed you last quarter, next quarter as we add the completion of the second half of the year for 2015, we’ll obviously add that data to the chart.</p>
<p>This is a new chart and I wanted to take the opportunity to talk a little bit about what our growth rate looks like over the last several years. This includes all sources of billing. So these are billings number. It includes both organic and inorganic growth. The 31% in 2014 was largely due to the acquisitions plus growth in the business and the 9% this year is largely due to the business itself.</p>
<p>In reality, we not have the currency adjustment and had we performed better in Japan, the 9% would have been closer to 14%. So we feel pretty good about the overall growth trend in the business and we’ll look forward to a plan that Harvard’s future growth in 2016 as we develop our plan for 2016.</p>
<p>In terms of customer billing new versus existing, no surprises on this chart, the same performance that you seen overtime. We are and we’ll talk a little bit later about ways in which we think we can, more aggressively grow new customers, not just in higher education but also in the corporate space.</p>
<p>Breakdown by sector, again you see education being a very large contributor, we’ll talk more about what we’re doing to ensure that education continues to grow as well. But we also have some pretty interesting things we’re going to talk about for adding to corporate growth.</p>
<p>Domestic versus International, because of the community colleges, because of the state colleges of Chicago, you see that the domestic side picked up a bit in terms of overall percentages. So let me now talk about some of the other things that are going on in the business.</p>
<p>First off, last quarter we talked a little bit about a very strategic new distribution agreement that we had signed with Neusoft in China. Under that agreement there is takings of product from Sonic Foundry into Neusoft every quarter on a schedule basis. The first shipment of that happened in the third quarter and there will be obviously another shipment in the fourth quarter both around $300,000. It’s important that we work with our partner to ensure that they actually deliver those products to the end customer in China and we’re working very closely with them to ensure that the plans they develop to sell support the product will achieve their objectives. We’re very pleased with the team in China, the customer team in China and we look forward to be able to tell you some more exciting things as real customers begin to materialize in China.</p>
<p>Last year, when we prepare to support our higher education customers in terms of releases of software that they would be installing or refreshing for the all semesters we learned that introducing change at the wrong time can be unsettling to our customers. This year we have worked very hard to ensure that our most current release of Mediasite 7 is very compatible with what customers have been doing in past semesters and over 50% of our customer base will have successfully migrated to release 7 by the time they begin the school here.</p>
<p>We’ve done some very important things to provide, enhance, support the customers as I go through that migration. For example Leeds University is already fully installed with the latest releases both on the recorder software and the server software and they are very pleased with the results of those upgrades.</p>
<p>Now I want to spend a little bit of time talking about our positioning in higher education. We talked a lot in the past about how we address the high scale opportunities in higher education Leeds being our best example of that and if you haven’t had an opportunity to see Neil Morris’s webinar that describes how they went through the process, its really quite interesting to listen to what they did to ensure success in our very high volume, highly automated large scale implementation of Mediasite technology with our 250 rooms.</p>
<p>We’ve always been very strong in the mid range in professional schools. Business schools, medical schools, engineering schools where you typically will have 20, 30, 40, 50 rooms, but local to a single school as supposed to university wide. Our products really begin in that position six, seven years ago and we’ve always been very strong in that position. One other things we have seen happening though recently is that many customers who see what Leeds is accomplished in the North Carolina state of accomplished, why don’t get started in lecture capture. But they are finding that they are unable to make the same sizable investment at some of those schools have made and they want more entry level opportunity to checkout the technology and see how it works in their environment.</p>
<p>That’s why we have developed a thing we called Mediasite Catch. And basically this is a software offering that will run on a podium PC in our technology enabled class room and it has our same recording appliances, but scale back to deal with a more rudimentary form of a technology assisted class room or technology class room in a more economical version of that. And we come up with some very exciting licensee programs for our customers to now cover the full range of what customers want to do with lecture capture technology.</p>
<p>All the way from somebody who wants to start out on a small scale at a low cost to the highest largest scale opportunities where a lot of automation is used and huge numbers of class room hours are captured on a semester basis. So we feel very strongly positioned in higher education. Now some investors remarked and said is that really what you are going to rely on for future growth just higher education. And the answer is no. We’re very comfortable that we could make very acceptable returns in that segment. We’re very comfortable with that segment is going to continue to grow in fact probably a little bit faster than it has in the past.</p>
<p>So we’re going to continue to be a leader and we are going to continue to be very strong in that segment. But many people have also pointed out that from a corporate perspective there are a lot of corporate users of video technology and how the Sonic Foundry relate to those corporate users. And what we have done is look at a couple of cases focused on corporate customers over the past year or so. And try to understand how we can achieve a couple of objectives, number one enter corporate in a way that a high value opportunity for the corporate customer and number two, enter in a way that doesn’t take such a long selling cycle as we’ve experienced in higher education.</p>
<p>The first one of these segment opportunities we identified was with capturing rich media video conferencing output and making it available for the customer in a very convenient and flexible way so they can integrate that video into other video systems they have in house or put it wherever they want to put it to reach their end consumer of that video.</p>
<p>Now we could have taken two different approaches, we could have taken an approach that says sell them global Mediasite to do that and therefore go through unfortunately or probably a longer selling cycle or we could provide a simplified user interface that still leverages Mediasite technology on the back end, but exposes the recorded content of the customer in a much simpler and more flexible way. That’s what we chosen to do and that’s what Mediasite Join is all about.</p>
<p>We have talked last time about Clip Karma as well. Clip Karma is our interface to Mediasite content that has the simplified user interface packaging to permit customers to more easily and quickly adapt to it. So what we’re doing here is we’re leveraging our existing audio visual partner base, who is very that base of over 100 people in the United States and 100 companies in the United States is very familiar with video conferencing technology. They will be selling this service and it run as a service in our cloud as suppose to an on premise implementation. We can implement it much more quickly that way.</p>
<p>And as they implement it we will as they sell it to customers we will implement it in the cloud for each of those customers. The capabilities consist of gray analytics, much richer analytics than people are used to by using other recording options and also full rich media to take observer media and the actual video of the participants in the conference room and put them together into a very high quality presentation. We think the selling cycle on this is going to be short. We think that we can begin generating revenue very quickly and it will be a contributor to our overall billings and revenue in 2016.</p>
<p>Now just to add credibility one of our largest customers that’s using Join today and this is Join when it was tightly coupled with Mediasite. So what I’ve been talking about for the last couple of slides is a new offering that’s package and sold almost independently of Mediasite, but fully utilizing Mediasite technology. We begin earlier this year in February to sell Join as part of a Mediasite customer implementation. So if you are an existing customer Mediasite like LeBow College of Businesses and Drexel you can add-on Join very easily and very quickly. You can see the comments here that Matt Stocum made relative to their value of Join and it is again for an add-on it was a very simple thing to do for the customer. So this is a proven technology something we are doing today in the Mediasite world, what we’re going to be doing as we enter into the first quarter of next, fiscal year is being offering – is offering this more pervasively to corporate customers.</p>
<p>Now, the next thing I want to do is, talk a little bit about other things that we’ve learned in terms of how to get more value out of video for all customers, but in particular corporate customers. So the quote that you see up here from Wainhouse is really a reflection of the fact that people are not longer just recording video. That was interesting five or six or seven years ago. What they are doing now is they are building video into the workflow of other applications that they are running inside their enterprises or inside their universities.</p>
<p>We first became similar with this, with the degree of integration into learning management systems such as blackboard. And clearly for university, the fact that Mediasite fully integrates with their chosen learning management system makes it part of a much more broad solution. Now in Leeds they carry this on to go through a process of exposing Leeds concept, content outside of the university. Its one thing to record lectures and classes and make them available to registered students of those classes.</p>
<p>If however you’re going to expose that content outside the university, there are many different legal compliance practices issues that the university has to address. So Mediasite has implemented in the Leeds environment for example. A full capability that says that when a educator publishes a lecture and want to expose it outside the university, then there is a workflow that’s say, that’s approved for copyright and other possible concerns by someone in a totally different business section of Leeds, before it is actually published and exposed outside the university.</p>
<p>We generically call that compliance workflow. We implemented this over the last 18 months, specifically for Leeds but are now finding that impact it is extremely valuable in other contacts. I’m going to talk about two of those. One is the brokerage industry, the other is pharmaceuticals. In brokerage, we had conversations with a couple of customers that would like to capture presentations on financial subjects by members of the financial organization.</p>
<p>However their compliance departments are very concerned that before those presentations are exposed to investors that they let them for all the concerns that the compliance department would have. Mediasite does that and we are getting a lot of interest in the use of Mediasite as an integral portion of the workflow management to be able to accomplish that in a very reliable and safe way for the brokerage company.</p>
<p>Similarly with pharmaceuticals, there are many rules about how our pharmaceutical company provides drug information to prescribers, to doctors. And again the same kind of workflow or compliance issues coming to play. We’re working with a company outside of the United States, that basically will look to use Mediasite technology to manage that process between pharmaceutical companies and physicians.</p>
<p>So the point that I guess I’m trying to make here is that we think we have an opportunity to sell higher value in terms of the solutions that we offer into the corporate space and provide a growth and revenue that is larger potentially than the kinds of growth of revenue we’ve had in the past.</p>
<p>And I will take – it will take some time to develop these as businesses. But we’re in early conversations toward implementing a couple of those programs with customers and we’re actually extremely pleased with the potential of this to broaden the kind of revenue base we have outside higher education.</p>
<p>We are reaffirming our guidance for the full year, for 2015 and there is no secret given our year-to-date results that means we’re going to have a very strong fourth quarter. We are very confident of that. This is not an aspect which is going in our part, we have several large opportunities, that we have now are clear line of sight to ship by the end of September and so that’s what enables us to reaffirm the guidance with billings between $41 million and $42 million. EBITDA between – adjusted EBITDA between $1.5 and $2.5 and net loss of somewhere between $1 million and $2 million.</p>
<p>So with that I think we’ve taking you through some of the strategic things we’re working on. We’ll now ask Tammy to open it up for questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>A - Tammy Jackson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. First question do you see increasing competition in the following areas. Video content management, desktop capture versus appliance and finally video conferencing and content management from suppliers like Polycom and Cisco.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me take the video conferencing one first, some of you may recall that Polycom purchased one of our competitors accordant about five years ago and the purpose for doing that was to provide integrated video content management as part of the Polycom solutions. The customer quote you saw earlier from Drexel acknowledged that what we have done with Join is more capable than what Polycom has which has been the outcome of a work they’ve done with the according assets that they purchase.</p>
<p>So I’m not particularly concerned that there will be any increase in competition from the video conferencing folks. Clearly, the greater success we have the more will be noticed, but that’s for somewhere further down the road it is certainly not the case today. In desktop capture I think it’s safe to say that what we have done with both our Mediasite desktop offering by Mediasite and with capture our reflections of the current technology meaning their fresh designs they have an excellent UI they have been tested with real education folks in terms of producing content. I’m quite comfortable that the level of capability we have there will expand any future competition. So I’m not I see no big competition there.</p>
<p>BCMS is a different story. There is a lot of people playing in the video content management space. I think it’s safe to say that in the generic definition of the video content management we’re relative to new comers to that game I think our key will be and what I’ve just been talking about is providing other features and capabilities around video content management such as the things I talked about workflow management and so forth. So I don’t think it would be safe to say that Sonic Foundry is betting any great outcome on pure video content management rather we’re looking at leveraging the added value that we can bring around the edges of video content management.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Next question what is the current outlook for the U.S. education market for lecture capture?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>I think the outlook in the United States is not as strong as what we have seen outside the United States. I think what we have seen is that the outlook is strong for higher education where they are building out new buildings in particular schools. We’re well position for that and that’s going to continue a pace I think with what we’ve seen in the past. I detect though in the United States you see a lot of smaller projects experimenting with lecture capture and looking at the tradeoff between composed content which we do with My Mediasite and content that actually captured in the class room.</p>
<p>The new offerings that I was describing with Catch I think strongly position us for customers who want to do that. Our named account sales organization is very close to the top 400 higher education customers in the United States for that matter worldwide. And we look to make sure that we’re the preferred provider for both the experiment and the full scale implement.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Has Sonic Foundry thought about creating a new business model by contracting educators, so they can create a learning environment for people seeking either higher education or vocational training to improve skill sets maybe a revenue sharing model with universities or business institutions?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. That model I think is starting to happen through one particular company used to be tutor I think…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>2U.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>2U is the current name. And interestingly enough we’ve kind of been doing something similar with LDI in the event space. See if I can give you perspective on what we do with them. They have a number of associations that they capture content for and they do the full range of how to manage events. So that’s not something we do, but we use, they use our technology as part of that capturing to basically have their own revenue sharing kind of model with those associations. So we’re kind of familiar with that model, but I think the one thing that comes with that is a fairly large investment in the things you have to do around the technology we are good at and can build and operate effectively.</p>
<p>And so if you are going to work with the university to build the program like that, you need to have a lot of skills that Sonic Foundry would not have. Now if we can find a way to partner with somebody who is doing that and has those skills we certainly would consider it. But I don’t want to misleading, but we don’t have any active plans or considerations to go down like that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>How large is the My Mediasite revenue stream today and how quickly is it growing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>I’ll turn to Ken and ask him to comment on how large it is today.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Minor</span></strong></p>
<p>We’ve been billing about 5% of our revenues now are coming from My Mediasite. So we’ve been running right around a couple of million dollars a year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>And it is growing nicely for the following reason. It’s a one year license program. So the nice thing about the revenue stream coming from this is customers renew. They have to renew on an annual basis. The way we price it is also metric somewhat I’m using, so that if the My Mediasite program in the university takes off and more and more educators use it, then at some point the university will have to upgrade the license to a higher level. We also see new education. So we’re very pleased with the growth that we’re seeing on the renewal rates, we also I think it’s a, very fortunately that if you look at the amount of money that we invest and developing the product, we have already fully paid that back and then so.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Minor</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, it has been very successful and has been growing pretty significantly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Are you concerned that My Mediasite and Mediasite catch will cannibalize your core business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Not at all. And the reason for that is that – all of the products that we produce are scaled for a particular part of the customers environment. So to give you an example of how we accomplish this. We have some very high end recorders that are capable of doing live streaming that are capable of collecting three live videos very high capacity units. Those are as you would guess priced at a very – in a much higher every solid price. Our newest model the – RL120 has been scaled back both in terms of cost and in terms of capability. So a customer who buys an ML120 may buy it at an entry level price that doesn’t include live streaming and only has one video stream captured and so forth. That’s in fact what we have done with some of our new large offerings and the release right as we said hey if all you want to do is pay for the minimum entry price per recorder then we’ll do that. But we will restrict the software license that goes with it to do a lot less then what you’d get with the full scale recorder. Catch is another example where it depends on what the customer wants to do with Catch. We do not support Catch in an environment that will equal that of what we can do with a full scale recorder. So its all about restricting the capabilities of your different products to match the price and to keep away from cannibalizing the higher functions in more expensive part throughout.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>When and how will Sonic Foundry become profitable on a consistent basis? And do you expect overall ASPs and margins to keep trending lower or higher overtime?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me try the last one first, this quarter I look to going to make sure I’ve got this right. This quarter we were at 67% margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Minor</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Last year’s quarter we were at 69%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Minor</span></strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Both of those had significantly numbers of large deals in the case this year it was Kuwait, the first installment of Kuwait wanted many to come of what. And last year was NYU and Leeds.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Minor</span></strong></p>
<p>And Leeds.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>So whenever you have a very large deal and that occurs in a single quarter you will see a reduction in the overall average selling price against the margin. That’s promotional. We see no trend in terms of lower margins. Our entry price recorders are cheaper to make less expensive to make. So the margin percentages trend in the right direction. Our software offerings obviously don’t have any cost of goods sold to go with them. So I’m comfortable that we’re able to maintain the same kind of range of margins that we’re managing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Minor</span></strong></p>
<p>I totally agree I mean we expect our full year gross margins this year to be very comparable to what we had last year. Despite the fact we are coming out or we have come out with the lower price recorders that we talked about I also expect margins to be pretty consist in next year with the full year of the lower price recorders. As Gary said that recorder is cheaper to make. We’ve also come out with new revisions to the full scale recorders that are also cheaper which will help us with gross margin rates next year. The ASP you mentioned your question was certainly an impact this quarter. I think the ASP will go back up unless we have significant transactions in that lower price. Recorder again, next quarter the larger transaction that we’re talking about in particular that we had an opportunity and closing either in Q3 or Q4 is not in one of those lower price recorders. So that will bring an ASP backup I think.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>The first part of the question was when we will be consistently profitable. So we talk a little bit about that. The fourth quarter based on again, simple arithmetic is going to be significantly profitable, otherwise we can’t sit here and reaffirm our guidance. So that’s undoubtedly true. All cases it is a question of balancing three things. The margin which is what purchase money down to cover operating expense and Ken and I just answer that question that’s going to hopper around the same number that we’ve had historically. So about the same percentage of revenue will be available for margin contribution.</p>
<p>The operating expense I think this year we’ve demonstrated that we’re performing on the expense plan we set out at the beginning of the year, we do not see significant rises in those expenses next year. Of course we see salary increases we see that, things that you would expect to have happened as you, as you run the business, but nothing in terms of investment. So it’s all about the top line and this year we had two disappointments other than timing of when large deals at. The first disappointment was the currency situation both in Europe and in Japan.</p>
<p>Except to describe it and plan for it we’ve discussed whether or not we can hedge we’re too small of a company to hedge. So no, we’re not going to do currency hedging. Japan next year as an outlook that says its not going to be as its not going to go back the other way. So that is what it is I’m not going to say, I’m going to how to figure out how to change that. The other disappointment of this year was the results in Japan, between currency and the performance of the business in Japan I think we gave up four or five points of growth and that second part performance in Japan we’ve taken steps last quarter and this quarter to bring a new management and to put a term in place with some plans that we think we’re very nicely turn the base performance of the business around.</p>
<p>About 70% of our cost in Japan is denominated in yen, the revenue was all in yen. So the only portion that’s really denominated in dollars is a transfer pricing of the product we move into Japan. So we feel very good about the recovery in terms of the performance of Japan. Currency will be what it is, now, that was a long way to answer of saying yes, we’re going to develop a plan for 2016 to be profitable. The word consistently profitable is always a concern to me because as we’ve said the first two quarters of the year tend to be weaker in terms of revenue and obviously, I can sit here right now and say that we will be profitable each and every quarter of next year. But I can say that we will absolutely be strongly profitable next year. We’ll give you guidance when we come up with our plans with the full year.</p>

<p>How do you expect the Chinese economy to impact your partnership and growth prospects with Neusoft?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, in the short-term I don’t expect it to have a very direct effect for the simple reason that are distribution agreement is denominated in dollars and our distribution agreement has minimal revenue commitments for six quarters and total including Q3, that the Q3 that we’re talking about today. Now having said that no distributors going to keep buying product if they can’t sell it in their local geography. We’re pretty close to Neusoft management in terms of looking at the plans that they have and the pricing that they have and from the start those have been very aggressive. So I have asked that question of the people who know in China and I have detected no adding concern because of what is going on today in China with the devaluation and so forth.</p>
<p>But it is fair to say that we have to work very closely with them to make sure they are selling the product or longer term we’re not going to get the kinds of revenue growth we want to that relationship.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Have you considered any consolidations or mergers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>No. And we have not been – we’ve not had the opportunity to talk to anybody about that and we’re not aggressively or even possibly pursuing anything at this time.</p>

<p>Is there an update with Clip Karma as far as when it will be rolled out?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Well. It will be rolled out as part of the corporate joint video conferencing recording service that we’re launching it will be branded as part of that service, but Clip Karma plays a very fundamental role in bringing that service to market. There is another effort underway to use it is part of our events business, which I’m not prepared to talk about today. But again, it will ride with the events brands, not necessarily standalone. We’re continuing to decide where Clip Karma is best positioned in its own right as a service on its own and obviously we will keep you updated in future quarters, what will happen with that and when it will happen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>This next question involves trends in larger schools and higher education, are some of the large schools such as University of Pennsylvania, Harvard and NYU are they moving away from Mediasite toward free or cheap technologies like YouTube or are they continuing to expand Mediasite footprint even alongside those cheap or free offering?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gary Weis</span></strong></p>
<p>Every indication that we have in any of our larger schools is that they continue to relay on Mediasite technology, now I will say that in any large school, where you have multiple different schools or any large university, where you have multiple different schools in those universities. You’ll always see the opportunity for an individual school to do something different. For example humanities programs cannot to value rich media content as much as engineering or business or medical. And there is no doubt that in some of our large schools or some of our large university customers, there maybe an individual school that decides to use YouTube or some other technology, because it’s appropriate for their particular curriculum.</p>
<p>One of the reasons why we are doing, Catch the way we are doing it, is to offer schools like that and some of our larger university customers, the opportunties stay under the Mediasite umbrella, especially for back-end content management and analytics and so forth. Right, without having to sacrifice that to do something and to achieve. So we feel pretty good about how we structured the Catch offering and we think it will enable us to exercise a higher level of account control where any university, where we are the selected technology and were schools may have a lower cost profile requirement.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tammy Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>There are no further questions.</p>
<p><strong>Gary Weis</strong></p>
<p>Okay, Well. Thanks for joining us this afternoon and the next one that we have will be a little bit longer time in between because it’s our closing of the fiscal year and it takes us little longer to do that. But we look forward to talking you then and hopefully talking about a very successful fourth quarter. Thanks for joining us.</p>
