This quarter's MD&amp;A, news release and unaudited financial statements can be found on our website at www.blackdiamondgroup.com as well as at SEDAR website.</p>
<p>Dollar amounts discussed in today's call are expressed in Canadian dollars and are generally rounded. I will now turn the call over to Trevor Haynes to review the quarter. Trevor?</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Haynes</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Tom. Before getting started with the review of the second quarter, I’d like to address some of the concerns that we’re seeing in the marketplace this morning. While the environment in Western Canada is clearly difficult for all industry participants, our platform of remote workforce and specialty rental businesses is performing relatively well. Later in the call, I will talk about how our platform has been designed to weather these conditions.</p>
<p>We continue to have a strong balance sheet. We’re generating free cash flow and selectively investing growth capital where it is supported by long-term contracts. Our clients and assets are diversified across a number of industries and geographies and we’re continuing to see activity on a number of fronts. We are actively picking up market share and our rental fleet, which is relatively new provides us with tremendous operating leverage for when the economy and our economic environment improves.</p>
<p>As for comments on the quarter, weak pricing across almost all commodity classes is negatively impacting asset utilization in Western Canada and Australia. As a result, revenue is down 20% year-over-year. Last week, we announced a renewal of a contract in Alberta's oil sands expected to generate CAD26 million in revenue over two years. We also signed a contract in June in our BOXX Modular division for space rental assets worth CAD5.9 million in revenue over two years. This is in addition to the 1,244 bed camp in Dawson Creek, the second phase of which went on rent in April. These are certainly challenging times for our industry, yet, we continue to see a base level of activity for Black Diamond.</p>
<p>EBITDA declined 33% to CAD23.3 million, reflecting the lower utilization rates across our business platform. We reported a net loss for the quarter of CAD800,000. The loss for the quarter was triggered by the 20% increase in the statutory corporate tax rate in Alberta and its impact on the Company’s annual effective tax rate at a time when the economic environment is driving down revenues. Without this increase in Alberta income tax, the Company would have reported a net profit of CAD2.6 million for the quarter.</p>
<p>Our capital plan for the full-year of 2015 remains at CAD50 million, of which CAD36 million was spent at the end of the quarter and CAD3.9 million committed. We expect that operating levels will continue to be weak compared to historic norms until a catalyst event occurs. Catalyst for higher utilization could include a Canadian liquefied natural gas project, achieving a positive final investment decision, a recovery in oil and gas or mine mineral pricing or any other event that might trigger increased utilization or additional capital expenditures by customers in our end markets.</p>
<p>I’ll ask Mike Lambert to go into more detail about the financial results across our divisions for the quarter. Mike?</p>
<p><strong>Mike Lambert</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Trevor. On a consolidated basis, EBITDA for the quarter was down 33% or CAD11.6 million from a year ago. As you can see from the chart on slide four, much of this was related to our Structures business unit, which continues to be impacted by lower utilization as a result of a significant decline in oil prices. Our Logistics division was down 11% or about CAD600,000 due to lower occupancy levels, partially offset by higher adjusted EBITDA margin, driven by revenue mix.</p>
<p>Energy Services EBITDA was down year-over-year as low oil prices continue to result in lower rates and lower utilization. International results were also lower year-over-year due to ongoing headwinds in commodity prices that Australia’s reserve sector is currently facing. Administrative costs were down slightly year-over-year due to lower bonus and commission costs offset by severance.</p>
<p>I’ll now review the key financial metrics on the next slide. As Trevor pointed out, we reported a net loss of CAD800,000 for the quarter. The loss for the quarter was triggered by 20% increase in the statutory corporate tax rate in Alberta, increasing the Company’s annual effective tax rate, which when applied to the Company’s deferred tax accounts led to a CAD3.4 million impact to our bottom line this quarter. Unfortunately, this came at a time when the economic environment is driving down revenue. Without this increased Alberta income tax rate, the Company would have recorded a net profit of CAD2.6 million for the quarter.</p>
<p>Funds available for dividends decreased by 39% due primarily to decreased activity levels. This combined with the dividend increase we made in August 2014 meant that our payout ratio was 44% for the quarter compared with 26% a year ago. Based upon the current run rate of Black Diamond business, current contract coverage and diverse range of marketable assets, we expect to be able to meet all of our financial obligations while continuing to pay a dividend.</p>
<p>While the net debt to EBITDA ratio crept up to 1.59 times, primarily as a result of the second tranche of CapEx for the Dawson Creek’s 1,244 bed camp, our balance sheet remains strong.</p>
<p>I’ll now turn the call back over to Trevor.</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Haynes</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Mike. Last quarter, we talked about a few of our oil and gas workforce accommodation customers whose contract had expired and that at that time, they were opting for short-term extensions instead of long-term contracts, given the uncertainty in oil prices. Last week’s announcement with the contract renewal in the SAGD area of Alberta’s oil sands is an example of where we’re able to move a key customer from short-term renewals back into a longer-term contract.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that the contracted future revenue on slide six does not include the SAGD renewal, which we expect will generate CAD26 million in revenue over two years. Given some of the talk of pricing concessions and rate degradation in our industry, I think it’s important to remind our listeners today about how our platform is different from many of our competitors. Many of our analysts expressed concern about rate degradation in the contract renewal we just announced. Part of the advantage and also performing catering and other services that we know where and how we can work with our service providers’ rate concessions to achieve savings on behalf of our customers without having to significantly compromise Black Diamond’s margins.</p>
<p>Slide seven shows where Black Diamond fits in a value chain we own in specialty rental assets. We outsourced all the services around these assets and can therefore achieve downstream concessions that we can pass along as part of our value proposition to our customers. This is a way in which we are different from our competitors and again speaks to how we have positioned Black Diamond to weather the cyclical nature of the industries we operate in. We also recently saw a report suggesting that should LNG go ahead all the assets for the upstream, midstream and downstream would have to be new builds. This is simply wrong. More than two-thirds of the worker accommodation associated with these LNG projects is serviceable with existing industry assets.</p>
<p>Given the current business environment, we are aggressively addressing operating costs and overhead, outsourcing functions like construction services and certain areas of our logistics business is aligned with our core business model and expected to have a positive impact on our direct costs. In addition, by amending the covenants of our revolving credit facility, we have further enhanced Black Diamond’s financial flexibility in the event of prolonged downturn in commodity pricing.</p>
<p>In short, we are being very proactive about enhancing Black Diamond’s operating and financial flexibility. As a result, we’re well positioned to weather this environment with a diverse asset base, exposure to regions that continue to experience ongoing activity and stable loading in our large managed cash. A good example of our diverse asset base is Black Diamond’s BOXX Modular workspace rental platform, which is currently generating approximately CAD7 million per quarter in EBITDA across United States and Canada. This platform is not only geographically diverse but also services a wide range of industries in addition to oil and gas, including everything from construction, education, government and even banking.</p>
<p>The Company is sound, and within our current run rate, we expect to be able to meet all of our financial obligations while continuing to pay a dividend.</p>
<p>Thank you for listening. Tom?</p>
<p><strong>Tom McMillan</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Trevor. We ask who participate from the question-and-answer portion of today's call to limit themselves to two questions before re-queuing. Operator, we are now ready for the Q&amp;A session. Operator?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-And-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the first question is from Greg McLeish from GMP Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, guys, I was just trying to get a feeling of how the structures business and our logistics business will look now that Dawson Creek came online fully in April?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>The Dawson Creek camp is a rental-only operation, so it doesn't impact our logistics business in that we don't manage the catering and other services. So the impact will be through utilization in our camps business for the structures business unit. And the utilization of all of the assets have gone on rent and the last tranche would have gone on rent on April 1. So it would be fully reflective in the utilizations that we reported in the quarter. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so that is – so we shouldn't maybe necessarily think of an increase in rental revenue in structures going into Q3?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>What you see in the current quarter is about the current run rate you would expect. I'm not giving you any forward information, but essentially because it started renting at the beginning of the quarter, it’s currently reflected in the quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And how should we be thinking of the structures non-rental revenue morning forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>Again, we won't comment on moving forward, I would tell you that what is reflected in the current quarter reflects our normal activity in terms of either [indiscernible] the sale of assets which were very low in the quarter. I wouldn’t expect that to increase or decrease significantly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. I'll get back in the queue. Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And the next question is from Dana Benner from AltaCorp. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dana Benner</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks and good morning. I wanted to start with pricing. Of course it’s been decimated in so many of the subsectors for all of your services and yet you look at your numbers and I think they have held in marvelously well and maybe you could give us some color as to why that is because I think it’s probably something that a lot of investors don’t even appreciate.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>It is a good question. We certainly have received many questions and commentary around pricing and trying to determine directionally where pricing goes in our industry segment. Quick to point out that there are so many sub segments that we participate in, in terms of all of the different types of assets in all the different geographies that we are working in to suggest that there isn’t pricing pressure in some of our core areas such as workforce accommodation would be incorrect.</p>
<p>Contacted nature of our business is such that some of the pricing changes take time to work our way through the system. Certainly on existing assets addressing the market especially in the – our ubiquitous asset classes where currently there is more supply than demand. We are experiencing pricing pressure on rental rate and even into the ancillary revenue streams. </p>
<p>We've been able to maintain margin around our logistics businesses which is where we are managing various services and to suggest that the pricing to the customer isn’t improving is incorrect. We need to be able to come up with solutions and work with our vendors, we are providing services under our umbrella to improve efficiency and to reduce cost and even to reduce margin. And so we’ve got some resilience around the way we are structured. It’s helping us to both provide and improve value proposition to the customer who is certainly much more cost conscious whereas continuing to mute the effect of that on our operating margins. On a forward run rate, I think Troy on rental, runt rate on existing assets perhaps rental rates for cash for example would be maybe 20%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Troy Cleland</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, to Trevor's point is, any new projects that we would be encountering I think it's consistently been in that 15% to 20% range of the pricing pressure that we are seeing or we're bidding at those levels.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Quick to point out where we have new capital going into our system that our expectation on returns of course we’ve always looked at a risk adjusted, risk being utilization. So longer the contract the better the pricing we are willing to provide. Our view on a new dollar capital going out hasn't changed at all. Our expectation on return will be the same. So this is more isolated to the existing assets already in our fleet where we're seeing some of that pricing compression, but again across our US platform, for example, we are seeing increased activity in our space rentals business in Canada increased activity, so no price degradation and those elements. And again our logistics business has held very well in terms of margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dana Benner</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Second question would be around the usage of bed. So in an environment like this if you think about client mix and the way it evolves, how would you describe the average occupant of a bed in market like this? Does it move more toward and does the mix shift in a way that that maybe is not – it doesn't necessarily show in the numbers. So it becomes predominantly repaid and maintenance oriented in an area or maybe just address usage of beds by clients and how we should think about that and is that a meaningful inquiry by others?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Stein</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s Steve, it is a good question. Our customers are very cost conscious right now and we are seeing a shift to our existing fleet or refurbishing our existing fleet. There has been some speculation that customers on new products are asking for all new fleet and it’s not the case. There is a shift now to stock in the market where we can refurbish or obviously the demand for labor has lowered, so the expectations on new equipment or bigger bed space is lower than the past few months.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Just to expand on that, the other part of your question is, what type of workers customers needing to house and has that changed from what might have been predominantly construction craze, is it now more operations oriented or turnaround oriented.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Stein</span></strong></p>
<p>I mean, larger pipeline activity is obviously still active or it’s above the active hopefully. And so a lot of that -- there is not a lot of drilling or lot of fracking going on, so completions used to be large component of our workforce. It is more into the straight construction of pipeline trades now. And again demand for labor is lower, so it was all a race on who can supply these newest to the camp and that would really come down to a cost feature and so our existing fleets would be utilized first.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dana Benner</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that’s my two. Thank you very much</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Jon Morrison from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning all. If you would release an updated version of the contracted revenue profile inclusive of the 450 bed contract renewal, is it fair to assume that it would be something in the mid-90 million range and extend your duration to something around a year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>This is for the structures, Jon, or are you talking about --</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry, just for the structures.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>So we would add the guaranteed revenue on that contract which would be 16 million. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And would it extend the duration out meaningfully from what was disclosed in the release? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>On a weighted basis, I don't have that readily available. It would extend for sure, how large an impact --</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>It would be meaningful, right. Just four months right now are hovering around nine months of weighted averages contracts outstanding. We are adding 16 million on a denominator of 76.5 million, so I think it would have a fairly significant upward pressure on our weighted average contracts outstanding, Jon.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>So thinking about it adding 25% isn't a bad way to think about it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Within the release you talked about putting the competitive landscape into three buckets, so the first bucket referencing pricing and economic returns for new projects with new assets, and you referenced that being in line with historical norms and relatively changed. What gives you confidence to make that statement when there is few – I believe few projects being bid with new capital assets right now or few projects being awarded at least?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we do have – we continue to have demand on capital albeit mostly through our space around those business and the return expectations on that new dollar capital, I think it’s important to point that out in terms of our capital allocation strategy. You’re correct that our overall Capex has come down significantly. There are a few projects out there that are of our size that are active in our market for pricing and our view on a new dollar capital going out in terms of how we are approaching those projects does differentiate to existing or a repurposed existing asset, our fleet is quite new. </p>
<p>So putting money into reconfiguring the internal demising of our buildings is much more efficient for our customer who is very cost conscious these days than going to new manufacture and by virtue of us not being a manufacturer, it may have a bias towards putting existing capital assets at work and our customer does like the value that that represents versus building new. </p>
<p>Other point to make is pricing on new assets has come down as well, so our return expectation has a payback against that asset and as far as rental contract can remain the same, but our customers still getting a lower cost than historic when they look at that rental rate and that’s by nature of the large amount of excess capacity in the manufacturing side of our industry and the fact that pricing has changed to where there is demand for new product. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>So is it fair to assume that the incremental award that you announced this morning on the BOXX side is an astronomically different award you’ve seen over the last few years when you take into account the lower input costs for the specifically the new assets being deployed with that contract?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, the customer is seeing a lower rate, because we are efficient on the cost of new manufacturers, but our return expectation within the context of that contract, with that customer is consistent with the past many years. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>A lot of the dialog we had with the customer was, they are responsible of that they wanted all new equipment and it took some time, but we have been walked through some of our existing equipment and helped them understand that these assets are only two or three years old, there is not much of a difference between our existing fleet and the new build assets, and because they are cost conscious and we can provide, show some flexibility in our pricing on the existing fleet, we are able to change that mix, so that we weren’t spending much new capital. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Appreciate the color. I’ll turn it back. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And the next question is from Jeff Fetterly from Peters &amp; Co. Please go ahead. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning guys. A few random questions. First off, the strategic cost initiatives that you mentioned through the release, how has that progressed so far and why do you expect to take until 2016 to realize benefit?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, Jeff. It’s Mike. We have been saying, right – actually I think from the beginning of it, the strategic cost measurement has to take a look at the way we do business and how much we contract and our buying power, and we are going to – and it will take until next year to actually achieve those savings. We have to add some quick wins, not meaningful to actually even talk about for this year, but we still are targeting anywhere from 4 million to 6 million in terms of the savings that we anticipate for 2016. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Part of the process, Jeff is that you budget in your expected savings for the next year and then essentially hold that discipline for the following year, so that’s why it takes that one year cycle.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Troy Cleland</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. On the G&amp;A side, I think on the direct cost side, our team has responded quite well, part of that is streamlining our models. Actually original intent to achieve seeing us moving construction services out of the platform, but also on a less material basis, some other of our self-performed services has been sourced, in our logistics business, for example. So our first line of advantage is to recalibrate our operating cost, direct cost below the line and then what takes a bit longer is to recalibrate the platform infrastructure is what Mike just touched on.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>But you’re interpreting your disclosure from an administrative standpoint, the year-over-year reduction in costs is more to do with the run rate of the business in terms of your bonuses and commissions and share-based compensation rather than any material reductions to-date on the structural costs? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, as a matter of fact, you can use the current quarter as a typical run rate for us. We had some one-time cost reductions offset by one-time cost increases severance. And so our current run rate this year is doing a model on our financial model where you could use the current run rate. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>In terms of renewals, how many beds or what magnitude do you expect to be on the renewal side or subject to renewal in the second half or by year-end 2015?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s hard to come up with an accurate number, the announcement we made last week was one of those renewals, but there are some ones that declined [ph] month-to-month, there has been times where you may have thought that they were going to keep the asset and more accounts came home, so it is hard to predict. The clients, they wanted to take advantage of the flexibility as much as they can and are a little bit hesitant right now than anything of long-term nature, unless there is certainty or exactly what their Capex or their budget is going forward. There are some other accounts that they are going to start up again, so you call that a renewal and also there are main camps or big camps, we expect that still being played are very cost efficient for [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Property accounts for renewal in the second half there. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>I guess, specifically your commentary in the MD&amp;A around negotiation with customers for additional long-term renewals on current camps, can you give us a sense from a magnitude standpoint what that would cover or address? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the largest of those, which is in the second half of the year takes us into 2016 is great [ph] and depending on renewal discussions around that facility with the existing years under operators in the area is where there will be some focus around our platform late this year and into the beginning of next year and the impact of some degree on our platform as you know Jeff is fairly meaningful. It was mostly over to that particular operations. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry, gentlemen, I would have to violate your two-question rule again for…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>I will comment on Sunday Creek as it – we have actually never had better loading than we do now at that camp. So just to give you the liability seeding, we are quite hopeful given that’s one of the busiest camps in Western Canada. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>Just to clarify the comments earlier, so like you said from a non-rental standpoint in structures, do you expect what we saw in Q2 to be a decent proxy for the second half of the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>So, Jeff, are you violating the two-question rule? </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>I have already apologized for violating the two-question rule.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Is more the current run rate is a fair assumption to make, we try not to give guidance but at least the current run rate doesn’t include anything unusual.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>So can you just help us reconcile that, so you’re -- you’ve talked about sort of CAD4 million of asset commitments for the next six months and if you’d look at your CAD50 million capital program, you have less than 20% of it remaining or about 20% of it remaining, how does that number stay flat given how much the Capex profile is going to decline in the second half of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure I understand the question, you’re saying that, so we are still essentially committing to our capital plan of CAD50 million, we have essentially either spent or committed CAD40 million with the remaining CAD10 million to be spent. We expect to be essentially not materially higher or lower than the CAD50 million and if I had to give you a sense of how that will be spent, I think more in the third quarter than the fourth but we do expect to be on our plan for the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Jeff, are you asking with the reduction in capital there would be sort of a ancillary reduction in mobilization, demobilization that all filter into the non-record that what you’re getting at?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s what I’m getting at.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Flat year-over-year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s what I’m getting at, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe the answer to that is that there would be some existing capital, it would be going out to working with would generate from the non-rental revenue and capital.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>And keep in mind non-rental revenue, when you talk about the box modular platform, it does include sales, not that significant in Canada but it is more of a component of our box platform.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, and sorry last question from me. In the U.S., the well sites performance, the year-over-over growth that you see there, can you just provide some context around how that’s achieved and what you see for that business in the next couple of quarters?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>You’re asking on a trailing basis how it’s been achieved?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>In Q2, you talked about being active on 32 rigs compared to 21 rigs last year, and given the macro conditions and the market moving the other way, is that something you’ve done on asset quality or have you done it through price or relationships?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re able to develop differentiating asset that represents considerable operational savings, and relocation savings for the customer such that they’re willing to pay what is a higher rental cost for the asset overall, their safety dollars and it’s been quite disruptive in that marketplace such that we’re finding a good deal of stickiness in terms of our assets working even though the rig count is dropping and so we’ve seen an increase in market share and we invested in more assets not in this particular quarter but through the end of last year, and into the beginning of this year, had invested a fair amount and like we see a bit more investment yet as we continue to deploy our strategy there and the operating day rates are -- we’d seen some compression through late spring, but we’re seeing a recovery now, so Troy if you want to anything.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Troy Cleland</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, just in terms of the number of rig locations that we’re on keeping in mind that Q2 of last year was kind of the early stages of this new segment for us as well. To Trevor’s point throughout the good portion of last year we started to grow that the number of sites that we did go to and because of the type of assets that we’re providing in the operational savings we are able to kind of keep them on site when a lot of other rig sites were coming home.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>Would the 32 active rigs be close to capacity for that business today?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>No, we’ve got -- we have capacity to service more although with the in and out nature of that business, it’s more like our Canadian energy services platform or we don’t anticipate to run at a 100% or that close to it given the way that the drilling business works but we could take on more of the current capacity -- translating that over into Capex, we could generate or we could take on more market share and generate more revenue without having to make additional investment in the near term on new assets for that category.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Fetterly</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks guys that covers my two questions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>I like how you count.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. There are no further questions registered at this time, I’d like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Haynes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom McMillan</span></strong></p>
<p>We do have Greg McLeish just queued for another question, so operator I’d like you to put that question through.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Certainly, one moment please. Mr. McLeish you may go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry guys just a quick question on LNG. Hypothetically, if the project did go forward, what would be the timing on getting some of the camps for the pipeline up and also for the other pieces of the operation up, so that they don’t lose potentially a year of construction?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>On the pipeline side, all of those logistics have been carefully mapped out by the project owner such that you would see fairly rapid deployment of pioneer camp requirements to get the early work started and then a build up from there where the main construction load and peak. So, for us, if we’re fortunate enough to participate, as we believe we will, you would see a fairly quick translation into field level activity in terms of moving assets and fairly short order of our strength following.</p>
<p>On the plant construction at the coast, some of the details are still being finalized on how that would work probably end up with a pioneer camp type of concept to have the workers required for the initial phases and more of a longer wrap up for the main facility coming on stream.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>So hypothetically do you think that these camps would have to sort of be deployed. I mean, as I said, if they want to remain on schedule, if they go to FID and they want to get let’s say 2020, 2021, when do they have to be deployed?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>I guess you need some type of investment decision or final investment decision somewhere near the end of this year. Our understanding and keep in mind, I mean, we just look at through one wins at these projects. So, in our view an investment decision by the end of this year in terms of what we need to do to perform again if we were a significant provider on the project I think that would keep them within the timeline you suggested.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Troy Cleland</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s a four to five year project, so you go backwards from there and that the pipeline can’t, we can deploy instantly is because the pioneer camps are fleet, existing fleet equipment so we can move quite quickly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Are doing seasonal restrictions on that though?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>They expect to be working around, so I’m not sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Troy Cleland</span></strong></p>
<p>There are some migration, wildlife migration patterns and stuff that it impacts certain areas, there is nothing simple about the entire program. But we’re staying with hypothetical, right Greg?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. And then, maybe on another hypothetical question related to LNG. The other proponent out there seems to be fairly active, quieter in the press but fairly active sort of casting out different pieces of their development. Having you even talking to them at all or what you’re hearing on the Canada LNG side?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>You’re correct, they’re continuing to work on that project and in terms of the housing for the pipeline that customer is actively engaged in our market right now working through proposals et cetera and we understand they’re active in and around Kitimat area in terms of some of the pre-works et cetera and there is significant workforce housing requirement at the plant site as well as the midstream pipeline and then upstream. So we do engage, as you can imagine, with our customer as well. The pipeline is TCPL. Upstream involves within one of our strongest first nations partnership territories and then the downstream [indiscernible] as well. So I agree with your comments that we’re seeing activity around that project, little less press on it though.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. In terms of pricing and an RFP going out, specifically on the pipeline, that RFP is going out, we’ve already submitted and there’s been follow-up dialog since then. So there have been a fair amount of dialog and activity going on the LNG Canada front.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>And so just on that pipeline, is it similar to the print throughput, I mean I’m just trying to, print throughput I think needs nine pioneer camps, how many would this one be?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Stein</span></strong></p>
<p>The original bid had a little bit more than that, but I -- through some conversations, I think it’s -- they probably will reduce the number of locations somewhat. So it’s somewhat comparable to the Petronas or the Pacific Northwest LNG project.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg McLeish</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. The next question is from Jon Morrison from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m just wondering if you can comment on what the secondary sales market looks like for used equipment year-to-date, should you decide to divest any underutilized assets as the year progresses and I just wanted to ensure that I interpreted Mike’s comment correctly and that, in his preamble that revenue from used fleet sales was fairly insignificant in the quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>It is. And what we typically find is that when the primary market is active, the secondary market is active and the inverse is true as well. So less opportunities to sell, because the buyers of those assets tend to be remote resource developments as well, where it makes sense for them to own the asset versus engage for a specific period of time. </p>
<p>One of our end markets had been mining, I’ve been to the territories or in to Canadian Shield for example and of course the mining as an end market is certainly no stronger than it will at this period of time. However, there are one or two opportunities out there with some sites to them, where the customer sees the opportunity to acquire used fleet and larger quantities and so we’re seeing some changes in the market that way that may improve the opportunity for used in the near term.</p>
<p>There isn’t a very active used sale market for camps in Western Canada or even for our camp product in Australia. We do maintain a fairly active turnover through our space rentals business and that’s what has shown up through the first part of the -- first six months of this year and we think that continues on as just part of the normal trade around that type of asset.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Excluding any major changes in the macro market, is there any reason to believe that Australia’s business looks astronomically different over the next couple of quarters as it has over the past few?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Lambert</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t think that the expectations doesn’t look much different. The overall economy is down by the resource sector, which has really been the driver. What is happening in Australia though is there has been a huge commitment with respect to infrastructure, but that won’t offset the downward pressures on the mining and the oil and gas side of it. </p>
<p>Though we are seeing activity related to road construction, related to pipeline work, smaller scale projects, we’re well suited for in terms of being able to compete and we just recently installed a 100% camp in northern part of Western Australia for a road project and that included our utilities and services. So there are segments there that are showing some signs of wipe, and I would expect those projects would come to fruition in 2016 more so than in the remainder of this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>And that recent award basically as the non rental that we saw show-up in Q2 in terms of the increase?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>The front end works for that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Last one, a bit of a high level question for me, but what’s been the largest positive and negative surprises for you guys over the last three to six months as we move through this downturn? How has the pullback been different than previous downturns throughout your career, specific to the workforce accommodation and space rental, obviously you can draw on different companies and different experiences?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. The current one always feels worse than all the other ones. I don’t know that this pullback is significantly different than many that we’ve seen and certainly when we’ve built the model for Black Diamond and we’ve executed that model and our cautiousness around leverage and building in too much of the integrated infrastructure to outperform absolutely everything has been driven by our concern for this period of time. It is concerting to our revenues in our business off significantly from prior year, but as we take stock of what we’re working with here, we’re not displeased in terms of our flexibility and our model works how the cash flows are being generated.</p>
<p>So this is a bit more of the old fashioned commodity price cycle whereas the last one ‘08 ’09, the whole world was trying to solve that problem. I am sure the whole world necessarily wants commodity prices to rise. So what we focus on in this period of time is all the other industry segments that we can work for, the diversifying piece of our platform which we’ve been building since the beginning which is our space rentals.</p>
<p>We entered the Florida market, absolutely no resources associated with that and we’ve been expanding capital there. And having success in the Gulf Coast on the US side, the Eastern Canada as we mentioned earlier. So we’ve got plenty of things to work on and opportunities to pursue. </p>
<p>I don’t want to mischaracterize that in the short term, that can offset the downdraft that we’ve experienced, particularly around oil and our exposure to oil sands. But there are projects like Pacific Northwest that could offer the catalyst to rebalance supply and demand in our industry segment. So that was a high level answer.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s fair to say that consumer reaction and behavior isn’t astronomically different than past downturns in that it’s always brought at the beginning, it hasn’t felt much more negative than the past?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Trevor Haynes</span></strong></p>
<p>We’ve trended towards working for the largest operators by design and those systems, when they’re surprised by such a sudden change in their commodity market, after we react fairly quickly and the other way to put it, but it’s very painful exercise to go through. </p>
<p>We see that moderating now, not to suggest any rapid upturn, but I think our customers are re-planning around current commodity prices and as budgets are set this fall, we’ll have a better view of baseline activity and in what regions that’s going to be in and that will help us recalibrate such that for our customers and ourselves, surprise is more likely to be on the upside than the downside, and as everybody sets their plans for ‘16 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Morrison</span></strong></p>
<p>Appreciate the color. I’ll turn it back.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the meeting back over to Mr. Haynes.</p>
<p><strong>Trevor Haynes</strong></p>
<p>Thank you and thank you, everybody for participating in our second quarter conference call and webcast today. We continue to believe that Black Diamond has certain strengths that set us apart from other competitors. We continue to have a strong balance sheet and we’re generating free cash flow and selectively investing growth capital where it is supportive of the long term contracts. We are actively picking up market share and our modern rental fleet provides us with tremendous operating leverage when the economic environment improves. We look forward to speaking with you on our next quarterly call. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. The conference has now ended. Please disconnect your lines at this time and thank you for your participation.</p>
