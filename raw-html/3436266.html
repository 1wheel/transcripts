<p>Thanks, Chris, and good morning, ladies and gentlemen. We appreciate your time with Mood Media management to discuss our financial results. Presenting on this call is Steve Richards, Mood Media's President and CEO; Tom Garrett, Mood Media's Chief Financial Officer; and Ken Eissing, President of Mood Media, In Store Media.</p>
<p>The purpose of today’s conference call is to discuss Mood Media’s second quarter financial results, which were released yesterday following the close of financial markets. We refer participants to our Q2 documents as they contain disclosures, reconciliations to non-IFRS measures and forward-looking Safe Harbor language that is important to understand our results.</p>
<p>The information in our release and remarks made today contains statements about future events and financial results that are forward-looking and subject to risks and uncertainties. These forward-looking statements represent our expectations as of today and accordingly are subject to change and actual results may differ materially. The documents we file with the Canadian Securities Commission contain those risks and assumptions that could cause our results to differ from today’s discussion.</p>
<p>So with that, I will turn the call over to Steve.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Richards</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Randal, and welcome everyone. Today, I'll cover Mood's second quarter 2015 results and update you on the progress we've made to enhance our financial performance, drive incremental efficiencies across the business, and create growth and long-term value for stakeholders. When I've concluded, Tom Garrett will provide a more detailed quarterly review.</p>
<p>As we shared in our financial release, we are pleased with much of our performance in Q2. Let me cover several highlights. The results in the quarter were in line with our expectations with EBITDA growing on both an annual and sequential basis to $24.5 million. In fact, excluding the impact of foreign exchange and previous asset disposals, Mood increased underlying EBITDA by 10% on a year-over-year basis in Q2 as compared to a decline of 11% year-over-year in Q2, ‘14 on the same basis. Furthermore, all divisions reported improvements in EBITDA relative to their performance in the prior year.</p>
<p>Mood revenues of $117.7 million, while down 1.8% versus prior year on a reported basis, were up 6.4% on an underlying basis, excluding FX and previous asset disposals. In the second quarter, three of four Mood divisions reported revenue increases.</p>
<p>We delivered a substantial reduction in Q2 other expenses just as we committed to. In the second quarter, other expense was $1.7 million comparing favorably with the $10 million recorded in Q2, 2014 and as compared to the $28 million we incurred in all 2014. We remain committed to a substantial reduction in other expenses for the full year 2015 and ongoing.</p>
<p>Next, we've continued to build upon our operational synergy and consolidation programs, enhancing our expected savings measures to a new higher range of $7 million to $8 million annually via Wave 4 plus initiatives in 2015 and more broadly in 2016. The effect of our efficiency and synergy programs on our results is gaining traction. In the second quarter, operating expenses declined to $36.7 million, which is a reduction of 5% on a year-over-year basis, after reflecting the exclusions from the effects of prior asset disposals and foreign exchange impacts.</p>
<p>For free cash flow, we continued to expect a significant improvement in Moods free cash flow trend in 2015 relative to 2014. Our progress has been significant with more than $20 million improvement in 2015 and it will continue to be significant. At this time, we expect Mood free cash flow for full-year 2015 will not quite achieve positive trajectory as earlier expected but nonetheless the significant positive free cash flow improvements and momentum will continue to yield further benefits in 2016. Tom will provide more detail shortly.</p>
<p>Turning to Moods’ recurring business units, let me summarize with upgrades on sales, site trends, products and partnership developments. In Mood North America, our local sales rebuild continues and is gaining demonstrated traction. The Mood local sales team is now at 118 account executives and importantly, local gross gained from those AEs and the revenue performance in Q2 rose by 37% relative to the prior year. Additionally, local visual monthly revenues increased by 17% year-over-year, driven by our AE sales growth and successful installation of Mood TV solutions with several marquee QSR clients.</p>
<p>Q2 highlights from North America include the following. Overall gross subscriber revenue gain was ahead of plan in the second quarter and 6% ahead of last year’s performance. Re-contract continued to improve in the quarter. We re-contracted 16 premier clients for 5,000 sites and the vast majority of these re-contracts were achieved at stable ARPU rates. That is a significant turnaround from where the business was in early 2014.</p>
<p>In mobile, we had eight active premier client pitches underway and are continuing to increase the exposure and awareness of Mood Presence and Mood Shazam mobile solutions. We signed new business deals, upsell wins or equipment and labor contracts with major brands, including Chick-fil-A, CaRMS, [ph] Safeguard Storage, Wendy’s, Dickey's Barbecue, Restoration Hardware and others. We continue to make solid progress in advancing new partnerships that expand Mood local sales and sales distribution capabilities via both direct and indirect channels.</p>
<p>We remain on target to achieve our commitment to expand Mood local sales AEs or account reps to 140 by year-end. In Mood International, we grew underlying revenues by 11% and grew EBITDA by 7% year-over-year on a same currency basis. Highlights from Mood International quarterly performance include the following: Visual momentum continues to show strength in the second quarter. We achieved a new win for 500 sites over three years with a major fashion brand. 300 sites in 2015 with a new Top 5 Japanese auto manufacturer and that’s on top of the Japanese auto manufacturer that we signed previously in the last 12 months. And that should be for 600 more sites incrementally give or take a few in 2016 and then 600 sites over four years with a major multi-brand consumer goods retailer.</p>
<p>The deployment and implementation of Mood International’s largest ever audio-visual contract to-date with a separate Top 5 Japanese auto manufacturer is continuing to progress nicely. This is the one I was mentioning previously that was in addition to the new one that was just signed up. This solution is a multi-screen per site deployment for 275 locations in 2015 and further potential for 500 plus additional sites in 2016.</p>
<p>We began rolling out a large-scale visual installation across Europe for a total of 15 mall projects, each of which entail multiple screens. We see a growing price line of additional opportunities with this client in 2015 and beyond. In Mood International audio, we signed a top brands QSR client for 300 new sites in 2015 and that deal has further potential for an additional 1,000 sites in the QSR chains franchisee network. Our Mood International audio churn trends continues to improve and we are now re-contracting the majority of our client renewals at stable ARPU rates. Outside of our four large European markets, Mood is making solid progress within our Australian operation which achieved its highest ever monthly revenues in Q2.</p>
<p>In Eastern Europe, we achieved significant win with the major European bank where we signed a new 200 site contracts for our largest recurring deal in this country to-date. The Mood North American and Mood International overall site trends in the second quarter showed a solid improvement versus Q1. We are focusing new efforts to improve sales and churn results with local and premiere sales initiatives and though, there is more to be done, we are relatively pleased with our improvements.</p>
<p>A few highlights in this category include; we grew our visual subscriber base in both North America and in International. We grew our audio base in our International business unit. Our monthly churn of 1.0% in the second quarter compared favorably to 1.3% we delivered in Q1 of ‘15 and was slightly higher than 0.9% in the same quarter for 2014.</p>
<p>Mood total gross site additions of 10,834 in the second quarter improved versus Q1 ‘15 at 9,631. In the first half of 2015, Mood has improved its gross additions by 10% relative to last year. We continue to gain ground in Mood North America and Mood International, rebuilding our sales organizations, sharpening our focus on plan activities and leveraging cross-selling and up-selling initiatives. These initiatives are expected to further enhance Mood's site performance in future quarters</p>
<p>In terms of Mood ARPU performance, the improved trend towards stability in audio ARPU and continued improvements in visual ARPU were evident in our second quarter sales. While Mood reported ARPU of $42.96 was down 7.4% relative to prior year, though, roughly 75% of the ARPU decline was related to foreign exchange while underlying ARPU declined by $0.77 relative to prior year or only 1.8% reduction. On a currency neutral basis we recorded increases in ARPU in our international division in both visual and audio solutions and in North America for visual solutions. Our ARPU trend has improved materially over the four to six quarters and ongoing initiatives are designed to enhance Mood ARPU performance in future quarters as well.</p>
<p>Turning to TechnoMedia and BIS, or our new non-recurring units, we recorded substantially improved revenue and EBITDA results in the second quarter relative to last year consistent with our stated objectives on our last conference call. Both businesses are showing significantly improved performance on the strength of their clients and program sales pipelines. With that, we expect a strong year from both of our non-recurring revenue units.</p>
<p>For BIS specifically, second quarter revenues and EBITDA were in line with our expectations for the quarter. BIS revenues were driven up by 13% year-over-year on a currency neutral basis. BIS EBITDA was four times the level we delivered in Q2 ’14, a quarter where our performance was weak and where we quickly addressed our cost and revenue plans to correct this. BIS grew its sales backlog for committed jobs by 12% in the second quarter. Those are sales completed with implementations to follow as compared to 2014 levels. This improvement should yield ongoing in-year revenue gains and put BIS on track to deliver full year expectations.</p>
<p>Other BIS notable achievements include, BIS was appointed by Microsoft as one of its few partners for a new Microsoft Surface Hub meeting room collaboration solution for AV. This hub by Microsoft is a new tool in the formidable set of BIS AV capabilities. BIS won the Netherlands National Business Success Award for AV companies in May and can now use our press, sales and advertising mediums to bolster ongoing business development efforts with this accolade. </p>
<p>BIS won an outdoor LED installation solution for one of the largest outdoor advertising applications in the Netherlands with product revenues of several hundred thousand euros to come. BIS continues to make gains with wins or projects with Dutch Tax Office via an ongoing agenda for multiple applications and programs over several years. BIS singed new deals in the second quarter with Dräger, UWV, Ministry BZK, Penta College, and several others, these wins represent aggregate value of nearly EUR4 million which is now in the implementation backlog for future quarters.</p>
<p>Turning to Technomedia, our financial performance has also materially improved given diligent and focused efforts to expand revenue and program pipelines and accelerate cross selling efforts among Mood units. In Q2, TechnoMedia achieved revenues that were 56% higher than prior year in quarter revenues. Techno’s EBITDA was four times the level delivered a year ago and represents on the [Technical Difficulty] solid pipeline and initiatives that implemented client deferred progress from Q1. For the first half of 2015, Techno’s revenues have been increased by 26% relative to prior-year comparisons. In Q2, Techno had several new contract implementations and wins including MediaMath, which is an AV designed and build project in New York City comprising offices, conference rooms, auditoriums and other client spaces. Time Inc., a Manhattan AV office rebuild project comprising video walls and other employee and public spaces.</p>
<p>Other Techno wins included Gensler Resorts, Brookfield Office Properties, the Texas Petroleum Basin Museum and Ferrari World in the UAE. Techno’s successfully completed and advanced it’s Q2 backlog for client such Smuckers, Mangos, NBC Grill at Universal Studios and PRIMARK flagship locations in Boston and Madrid. The PRIMARK installations are a great example of how we are increasing our focus on cross selling efforts which enhances both Techno and Mood revenue streams. PRIMARK has been a client on our international or Mood international division for several years and they have now contracted with us to deliver large scale AV experiences in their flagship locations in Europe and in new locations as they launch those in the U.S.</p>
<p>In the GOCO or GoConvergence Creative Agency portion of TechnoMedia, GOCO continues to post strong performance driven by improved sales successes and a growing pipeline including the following. In the second quarter, GOCO was active with many more key brands including Atlantis Resorts, Smuckers, Texas Petroleum Basin Museum and Alarm.com. The Smuckers contract is a joint project between with Techno and GOCO and includes a series of programs for a multi-million dollar value. All GOCO implementation phases have gone exceeding well. GOCO landed new business wins in the quarter with Positec, Atlantis Groups [indiscernible] among many others. With their achievements to-date, GOCO is on track for a record year in 2015 delivering advanced media and content solutions for Mood’s clients.</p>
<p>Turning back to Mood global efforts, we’re pleased to announce the closing of the arrangement for our issuance of $50 million of foreign sub debt given the support of our backstop partners and the broader inventor base. The net proceeds of the deal will be used to repay our convertible debentures as they mature on October 31. By concluding this transaction, we can now begin to look forward to accelerated execution of our strategic plan, driving growth, generating increased free cash flow, relentlessly integrating our platforms and delivering compelling solutions for clients that drive enhanced shareholder value.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll turn the call over to Tom for his remarks on the quarter as well as detailed financial results. Tom?</p>
<p><strong>Tom Garrett</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Steve. The second quarter results show continuing growth in underlying revenues and EBITDA when excluding the impact of foreign exchange translation and asset disposals. We believe this trend speaks more clearly to the operating performance of the business than the headline accounting results in our review. We’re very encouraged that the team continues to execute against the key plans of the strategic transformation platform set forth just over year and half ago and we’ve been able to stabilize the business and are beginning to see areas of organic growth. We expect future quarters to show a continuity of progress.</p>
<p>Now let’s turn to the Q2 performance in more detail. Consolidated adjusted EBITDA was $24.5 million, which on a reported basis was up $476,000 or 2% growth [Technical Difficulty] prior year. On an underlying apples-to-apples basis, Q2 EBITDA was up by $2.4 million or 10.2%. The reported performance includes the impact of foreign exchange movement of a negative $1.5 million and reflects our prior year sale of Mood Canadian DMX accounts to Stingray surpassing them [ph]. The underlying operational improvement was driven primarily by $2.3 million lower underlying operating expenses with reductions driven by previously reported consolidation and synergy waves and initiatives. </p>
<p>On a reported basis, our key initiatives and actions enabled Mood’s EBITDA margin to grow to 20.8% in Q2 2015, up from 20% in the prior year’s period, with all of this improvement attributable to the underlying performance of the business. Our reported financial performance was significantly influenced by the ongoing devaluation of the euro currency relative to the US dollar. The value of the euro declined by 18% in Q2 relative to the prior year from an average rate of 1.37 to the US dollar in Q2 of 2014 and to average of 1.106 in Q2 2015. This movement reduced our revenues by $8.8 million and our expenses, both cost to sales and operating expenses by $7.3 million, so that the Forex impacted related to operations lowered our EBITDA by $1.5 million.</p>
<p>So let’s continue to look at some apples-to-apples year-over-year comparisons of the company’s business unit performance on a currency-neutral basis, while also adjusting for the sale of Mood’s DMX Canadian accounts to Stingray. This view reflects more accurate and complete picture of our underlying business performance. </p>
<p>First in terms of EBITDA, we generated underlying year-over-year growth in every one of our business units, including our core operations in Mood North America, Mood International, BIS and TechnoMedia. Our corporate expenses were higher only because of the mark-to-market charge for the foreign currency hedges. As we mentioned on our Q1 call, we expect Techno and BIS to grow revenues and EBITDA in 2015 on a full year basis with that growth weighted to later quarters in 2015. And we have begun to see that in the Q2 year-over-year comparisons. Both segments generated substantial improvements in their client and project pipelines, which supports our confidence they will deliver their full year EBITDA targets. </p>
<p>EBITDA in Techno and BIS are expected to grow 21% for TechnoMedia and 27% for BIS versus 2014 performance on an underlying basis. On a reported basis, BIS is expected to generate a 7% increase in EBITDA year-over-year. </p>
<p>As stated previously, for the consolidated group, our underlying Q2 EBITDA rose by $2.4 million or 10.2%. By segment, North America underlying Q2 EBITDA was up $400,000 versus prior year or 1.8% year-over-year and revenues were down by $1.3 million or 2.1% relative to prior year. Mood North America’s reduction in operating expenses shows continuing progress given our ongoing integration and efficiency initiatives. </p>
<p>Mood International Q2 EBITDA was up $300,000 or 6.8% on an underlying basis versus prior year. International revenues rose by 10.8% year-over-year driven primarily by 30% increase in Visual revenues year-over-year. Direct costs rose by 30% year-over-year, while operating expenses declined by 1%. On a reported basis, Mood International EBITDA of $4.1 million was down $700,000 driven by over $900,000 of foreign currency impact.</p>
<p>TechnoMedia posted Q2 EBITDA of $1.6 million, an increase of $1.2 million or up 300%. Techno posted revenues of $4.8 million or 56% increase in revenues versus prior year. Previously reported delays experienced by Techno in Q1 provided for job and program implementation moving forward in Q2 and the robust Techno revenue pipeline and backlog for jobs yet to be installed provide the rationale for why we expect TechnoMedia to deliver on its target to grow EBITDA by 21% on a full year basis in 2015. </p>
<p>BIS Q2 underlying EBITDA of $900,000 increased by $700,000 on a $1.6 million improvement in revenues. BIS operating expenses declined by $600,000 or 12% given their restructuring activities we implemented in Q3 of 2014 to right-size BIS cost structure. BIS substantially improved its revenue outlook and we expect it will deliver 7% reported growth in EBITDA for the full year in 2015. Corporate showed a negative variance of approximately 465,000 in the prior-year year with this variance primarily related to $500,000 charge for the quarter required to mark-to-market company’s foreign currency hedges.</p>
<p>Now, let's take a look at Mood revenue performance in the quarter. On a reported basis, overall revenues of $117.7 million were $2.2 million or 1.8% lower compared with Q2, 14. Foreign exchange translation and asset disposals together represented a negative impact of $9.9 million in the quarter, meaning that Mood underlying revenues rose by $7.7 million or 6.4% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Mood's rendering of services revenues of $82 million declined by $1.9 million in Q2, relative to the prior year with negative impacts of $4.5 million related to foreign currency and $1.1 million related to asset sales. Underlying rendering of services revenues rose by $3.7 million or 4.5% year-over-year. Underlying rendering of services revenues rose in our international and Technomedia businesses and declined moderately in North America.</p>
<p>Sales of goods revenue declined by $100,000 in Q2 relative to the prior year with $4.1 million negative related to foreign currency. Underlining sale of goods revenues increased by $4 million relative to prior year with international, BIS and Technomedia rising year-over-year and North America showing a modest decline.</p>
<p>Turning now to revenues by business unit. North America revenues were down $2.4 million in Q2, relative to prior year with recurring revenues down $3.1 million with $1.1 million related to the sale of the Canadian DMX accounts and $2 million related to net churn. Installation and service revenues were up $1 million, while equipment sales were down $300,000.</p>
<p>International revenues were down $3.3 million, owing to the decline in the foreign exchange rate. In local currency, international revenues rose the equivalent of $2.6 million or by 11% year-over-year driven by higher equipment and installation revenues related to large visual and audio equipment deals, which will continue to generate recurring revenues in future quarters.</p>
<p>Technomedia Q2 revenues of $13.3 million rose by $4.8 million or 56% year-over-year, given the previously mentioned pipeline and client project increases. BIS revenues decreased by $1.3 million year-over-year or 8.6% to $13.4 million. However on a currency neutral basis, BIS revenues increased $1.6 million or 13.7%.</p>
<p>Mood reported a reduction of overall operating expenses in Q2, 2015 of $5.9 million or 14% to $36.6 million versus the prior year quarter of $42.5 million. Foreign exchange represented $3.7 million of the decrease and underlying operating expenses were reduced by $2.2 million or 5.2% on the strength of our efficiency and synergy achievements and initiatives.</p>
<p>At this point, let's turn our focus to a discussion of Mood KPIs. First, site count, churn, gross adds. Company total sites at June 30 were 414,000, which is a decrease from the prior quarter by 1084 sites or a modest 0.26% net reduction in site count over the quarter. The decline in our site count in the second quarter was primarily related to audio churn where they were 1,262 site reductions and this was offset by a net increase of 178 visual sites. Combined churn was 1% per month in Q2 versus 1.3% per month in Q1. In Q2, we saw a moderation of churn compared to the first quarter, reflecting both the typically higher Q1 seasonal churn as well as the impact of the large low margin visual client to churn in Q1 that we discussed on our Q1 call.</p>
<p>Second, turning to ARPU. Blended ARPU was up in Q2 of $42.96 as compared to the prior quarter blended ARPU of $42.90. Audio ARPU was down $0.01 from $41.71 to $41.70 and visual ARPU was up to $81.93 versus $78.76. When we look at Q2 2015 versus Q2 2014, blended ARPU for Q2 was $42.96 versus $46.40 a year earlier, reflecting a $3.44 or 7.4% reduction. Foreign currency accounted for $2.66 or 77% of the decline in blended ARPU. On an underlying basis, blended ARPU was down $0.77 or 1.8%. </p>
<p>Audio ARPU for Q2 was $41.70 versus last year at $45.17 for a $3.47 or 7.7% decline. Foreign currency represented $2.35 or 68% of the decline in Audio ARPU. The underlying Audio ARPU decline of $1.12 was down 2.6% year-over-year, of which 0.6% was attributable to product mix.</p>
<p>Visual ARPU for Q2 was $81.93 versus last year at $85.08, for a $3.15 or 3.7% decrease. Foreign currency represented $12.68 of negative impact of Visual ARPU meaning that the underlying Visual ARPU increased $9.53 or 13.2% with underlying increases in both North America and Mood International as we replaced lower dollar or euro ARPU accounts with higher dollar or euro ARPU accounts and delivered net site growth of higher ARPU. Without the Q1 churn impact of a large low ARPU client, Mood International Visual ARPU would be up 2.5% and consolidated would be up 5% on a pro forma basis. </p>
<p>Converts and capital structure. We are very pleased to have announced a $450 million closing and funding of the new Mood Media Group S.A. notes with the proceeds fully dedicated to the repayment of the converts that are scheduled to mature on October 31. We believe this now definitely addresses any question regarding Mood’s payment of its debt as it matures. This transaction not only takes the maturity risk off the table, it also eliminates the significant equity dilution risk associated with the maturity being fully equitized, while the replacement financing provides a leverage-neutral and cash flow-neutral solution to our capital structure. </p>
<p>The new MMG notes enable us to extend our maturity schedule so that our earliest maturity is now not until 2019. This provide significant runway for the Mood team to further implement ongoing operational and strategic priorities and to drive further efficiencies growth and profitability gains. </p>
<p>Mood will continue to place high priority on improving cash and balance sheet positions with the objective to develop opportunities to further improve our capital structure. </p>
<p>2015 financial guidance. As we stated in our press release, we expect to deliver moderate EBITDA growth and a significant improvement in underlying free cash generation in 2015 relative to 2014. In fact, we expect to show significant improvement of over $20 million in free cash flow in 2015, excluding asset sale proceeds when compared to the prior year. We will achieve these improvements despite the headwinds of foreign exchange translation and the impact of previous asset sales on EBITDA generation. </p>
<p>We define our consolidated total free cash flow, which would include asset sales has the year-over-year change in net debt where a positive free cash flow would cause a reduction in net debt and a negative free cash flow would be evidenced by an increase in net debt. </p>
<p>For 2015, we had previously offered guidance that the company would generate slightly positive free cash flow. At this point, although 2015 will show the marked improvements from the underlying business just mentioned, we expect the total free cash flow number to post a slightly negative versus the slightly positive view it shared earlier this year. But we also expect the normalized run rate going into 2016 will be free cash flow positive and are working to make further free cash flow gains in 2016 as we continue to drive and enhance the operations and cash generation capabilities of the business. </p>
<p>As to our modified free cash flow guidance for 2015, and the context of the overall size of a $500 million global revenue business moving from slightly positive to a low-single digit negative free cash flows at relatively small shift. But we are very focused on even small shifts in free cash flow and will remain committed to delivering significant reductions in one-timers and improving underlying free cash flow from the business just as we have in 2015. In the spirit of open communication, let me explain the key variables here.</p>
<p>First, there has been some client-driven shifting of large international visual projects or the implementations moved to Q4 or into 2016 and the related collections to Q1 for a net reduction in 2015 collections. Secondly, we are addressing one-time true-ups in reconciliation settlements related to the 2013 to 2014 North American ERP conversion and related franchise affiliate processes and we continue to finalize these reconciliations related to the conversion. These have had the impact of lower than projected net collections from the affiliates in 2015, but we expect to recover in 2016.</p>
<p>Third, although we have increased and expanded our Wave savings initiatives into 2016, the realization of savings is also shifted to later in 2015 and into 2016 as well. Finally, we incurred higher professional fees than we anticipated early in the year on the MMG Note transaction. The completion of this many month process was [indiscernible] more complex from the multinational perspective and the increase in fees versus early year projections reflect this complexity. The key takeaway on Moods free cash flow is that although our guidance has shifted modestly, we are still delivering significant improvements year-over-year in the underlying business.</p>
<p>Delivering further free cash flow improvements will remain a key focus and objective of our team. Specific current initiatives identified that are expected to further improve free cash flow in future years include significant tax planning and relating cash tax reduction, additional Wave savings from labor arbitrage and standard work times, and enhanced revenues and cash flows from growing the business.</p>
<p>In closing, we are excited about our opportunities for long-term growth and remain steadfastly committed to fully executing our transformation strategy. We’ve continued to achieve meaningful progress and especially in light of having identified the solution for our converts maturity, our energies during the balance of 2015 will focus on our highly prioritized and aligned action plans for driving enhancements via the efficiency and consistency at Moods business and creating a foundation for enhanced longer-term gains and growth. We look forward to keeping you informed of our progress and diligently managing this business based on revitalized culture of intense accountability.</p>
<p>So, with that, we will now open the lines for your questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, we will now being the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Kevin Cohen, Imperial Capital. Kevin, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, and thanks for taking the question. I guess, first as it relates to the re-contract showing generally a stable ARPU I guess, what you guys attribute that to? Is it due to the Company having at this point largely shared the sort of lower margin legacy business or less competitive or is it Company providing more services or maybe somewhere all of those?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Ken, do you want to start with that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Eissing</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Hi, Kevin. I think as you said, it is pretty much all of those. I mean, I think if you look at the marketplace, it clearly, from a pricing standpoint, is a more stable market than it was a year or two ago. And we are focused as we get into re-contract conversations of providing additional value or additional products or services to our clients. And also, as we’ve stabilized the business operationally, that allows us to hold rate much better than we have in the past. So, it’s really a combination of number of things. And we expect that will continue going forward as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Cohen</span></strong></p>
<p>And then for the quick follow-up question, I guess, when you think about the biggest lever if the Company’s disposal to continue to improve the topline and EBITDA and free cash flow, what would you say that one item is at this point kind of over the next 12 months?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I would say that it’s -- it’s a combination of things in both addressing the local and wide space markets for both sales increases in headcount, but also distribution opportunities that certainly won. That’s in kind of the local side of the business, Kevin. In the premiere side, it’s going after new visual opportunities and basically bolstering those as opportunities into our client base and that visual opportunity is not meant to be excluded just to premiere. That applies obviously for our local guys and gals selling visual solutions to either their client base or their prospect base going forward as well. So, like Ken said, on ARPU, I think it’s a variety of things, but that is certainly a key area of focus for us. And, Ken, if you have other thoughts please add.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Eissing</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I think you captured it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Cohen </span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thanks very much and good luck.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Rob Goff, Euro Pacific. Rob, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rob Goff</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much and good morning. My question would be on the visual marketplace. Could you perhaps provide a bit more color on the visual market demands, the adoption rates and how they might differ by local versus premiere, international versus North America?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>So opportunities in the local space, Rob, include things like our QSR TV program and solution. That's an example that certainly has applicability for other verticals and other market areas of focus as well, but I think it’s a demonstration of basically what we can provide into the local and regional marketplace.</p>
<p>From a premiere solutions perspective, I think visual is a combination of the clients’ content where our content placed together in a solution that’s basically about the recurrent solution and service that we can offer to our premiere base. And then that's as it can complement the audio solution that’s already in place for that premiere base. So I think you had a couple parts to your question, but that's the first in terms of where the opportunity for approach is.</p>
<p>We are seeing more demand for visual in North America as we’ve referenced on previous calls than we’ve seen in past years. So US is as a market looking to kind of catch up, if you will, of where the European trends where a couple of years ago. That being said, we are, as evidenced by some of the highlights on this call, we are still seeing a fair amount of opportunity in space for us in the European market. And that’s as evidenced by our penetration into the audio segment, penetration into that and further into deployment to mall solutions and that sort of thing for retail et cetera.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rob Goff</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. And as a follow-up, you previously discussed the churn in visual on Q1 [indiscernible] rationalization, was there any similar impact in Q2 and do you see that visual churn continuing to decline?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I don't see any significant counter client like that from a Q2 perspective. And all I can tell you is, on an account by account basis, we are rationalized what we are offering, what we're providing it for and where we think that’s value and good value for us going forward and where it is not, we'll make adjustments as well, but we did not see any in Q2.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rob Goff</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Trent Porter, Guggenheim Securities. Trent, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Trent Porter</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, how are you. I was hoping to follow on a few questions. The first one I wanted to follow on, the last question that you just touched on. As I recall talking to you guys a few quarters ago, something that was going on in the background in your visual spaces that you were gradually developing or building your visual product to specifically enable you to penetrate more verticals. I think you started in the auto space and but you had built out into more. So now that you have got some of these legacy issues behind you and you are stabilizing ARPU, you’ve got the -- it looks like your site stabilization, thinking about growth drivers, could you give us an update on to where you are with that, what verticals you are now able to – you’ve got products for that you didn’t’ maybe a year ago and how the opportunity in the addressable market has expanded? And then also, specifically in the QSR space, what you are providing them today, what you are able to provide them today and that maybe you weren’t able to provide yesterday?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>So, I will talk to it sort of generically at the market level and then Ken can talk specifically in terms of the QSR specific depth and what we’ve done there and where that provides opportunity for expansion not only in QSR but North America and from an international perspective but where we think that can go with others. So to address your first part of the question, we have specifically built solutions for QSR, for healthcare, for auto, for what I’d call in the local space light retail et cetera and not just QSR but other restaurant categories as well. So those are examples where we have basically as [indiscernible] sort of taken the template, modified it and created an approach of off that template for other market verticals in that specifically.</p>
<p>There may be others that I’ve not mentioned here that Ken will address as well but I think generically or broadly those are some examples of where we’ve taken that in the last 12 or 12 plus months. Secondly on QSR specifically, your question on that of what do we provide and where do we see that as opportunity, I think we can speak to that in terms of a couple of the deployments that we’ve done in the U.S. recently and what capabilities that offers for what I’ll call infotainment in the dining rooms if you will, Ken can describe that and also describe kind of how that applies to other verticals. So Ken?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Eissing</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, thanks Steve. As Steve mentioned the bulk of our QSR work is in what we call either infotainment or think of it as TV replacement services for the dining room lobby. And what it is, is it’s essentially a channel, if you will, of curated content that we sell -- current and topical but without any objectionable content, plays local news, has a local flavor to it but allows the QSR to place random messaging and other localized content around the screen as well.</p>
<p>We’ve referred to it in the past, where we had our largest deployment; we’re live in Southern California with the McDonald's channel in Southern California approximately 560 to 570 sites right now. That great flagship anchor opportunity for us if you will, it’s provided an entree into other conversations within the McDonald's ecosystem but also within the broader QSR marketplace. And in terms of site count and revenues derived, QSR is our largest single vertical in North America. So we’re very optimistic about being able to further penetration across that footprint over the coming months and years.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Trent Porter</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. And if I can ask one more and then get back in the queue. In the similar vein, you talked in the past about your partnership strategy and I don’t know, maybe I’m over thinking of it but it seems compelling to me, a way to sort of not exponentially is probably the wrong word to put but magnify your opportunity set. So, I was wondering if you could give an update on how for example, is Shazam partnership living up to the expectations or is it still in an early stage or is it contributing an expected run rate, did you nail down the wireless speaker partnership and how is that going and then maybe more importantly, are these partnerships helping to expand the pipeline of other partnerships or accelerate entree into them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>So, let me again talk about that broadly and then if you have specifics, we can follow-up on that. So I think of our partnership strategy as content partnerships, technology partnerships or sales distribution partnerships if you will. And I think we have conversations going on across all of those fronts in terms of what we think. We can not only advance but advance quickly and bring value to our customers from a solution set perspective or obviously from a returns perspective.</p>
<p>On content specifically, I’m sorry, on content and technology specifically, I think that’s a great opportunity of basically looking at the platform that we serve and how can we enrich the product and solutions that we have basically to our customer base. Shazam has been a wonderful partner; we have been in multiple conversations either with Shazam together or Shazam and Moods separately, in conversations with premier brands about how we can extend that solution and basically test and trial what our retailers are looking to do basically to advance their mobile marketing solutions.</p>
<p>So that’s encouraging, there is obviously more work that we need to do there and part of that work is for the retail marketplace to continue to figure out how they want to use technology whether our solutions, beacon technology generally, et cetera to deploy mobile marketing solutions. In terms of wireless speakers, referencing that you made mention to, we have advanced that partnership, we’re in trial in beta stages with the partner and we look to continue to deploy that more broadly not only with them, but their dealer and distributor networks. So just stay tuned for that. Everything goes through testing, then trailing and then implementation and we’re kind of in the trialing, pre-implementation phase for a broader lunch. Again, if there are specifics that Ken you want to talk or touch on, please do.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Eissing</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I'll just add a few things on Shazam. As Steve mentioned, very happy with the partnership, great relationship there. Our efforts to date are primarily focused in the premier marketplace than as we’ve referenced or engaged in a number of conversations and a number of brands.</p>
<p>We've also recently -- in very recent calls, the last 30 to 60 days, begun to productize that for the local marketplace as well. Very early stages, but we think there is an interesting opportunity there to bring the Shazam in store to a local retailer as well.</p>
<p>And as Steve mentioned, the wireless retailer or the wireless speaker partner, we’re selling it right now. I mean, it’s Sonos, we’re live in the Sonos ecosystem right now. So if you have Sonos at home you can see Mood mix in there right now. We’ve been selling it via our direct sales force for the past 60 days or so and as Steve mentioned, over the next call it 60 to 90 days, we expect to launch that into the Sonos dealer network as well.</p>
<p>So we think that will be a nice incremental distribution channel and I think one of your other points is, do partnerships build other partnerships? The short answer is yes and we’re engaged with a number of companies across the content, the entertainment, the technology space and in various stages of partnership.</p>
<p>Beta is in launch, we’re in discussion with a variety of partners. So we think that strategy and that approach is a good incremental way to reach the market and we expect the coming months and years, that returns from the partnerships in general will become more significant and have more than impact on our results going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>And we look at all that as, in terms of product solution sets for our customers et cetera as how can we advance either internally or with others products and solutions that basically attack a second, third or fourth ring of service on that we can sell through. Our inside sales team which we are developing has a force, our locally sales team, our account management and customer care teams, but also through partners basically to advance the second, third and fourth ring of services attack on the audio at various ARPUs for various services, which give us sort of following the wireless telecom model, a broaden relationship for the customer for wallet share and deeper penetration. We think that will bode well for both increase in sales opportunity and revenue, but also promoting better retention rates for lower churn rates going forward. So watch for more of that, we’re in a variety of tests and trials for all these solutions, bundles and how we can promote them and we’ll report more on that as we’ve gone from, as I say sort of testing to trialing to implementation.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Trent Porter</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Alright. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>And by the way, that doesn't require a bunch of development work for the things that I'm talking about. It's really just tweaking some of the things that we have and promoting them. So I think we should probably go on to the next question.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Josh Nahas, Foxhill Capital. Josh, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh Nahas</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, guys. Thanks for taking my call. Just two quick questions. One, can you break out for us what in 2015 you spent on professional fees for the convert rebuy?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>We can get back to you off-line on that, I would be happy to do so.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh Nahas</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. Detail for kind of be able to add that back, but sort of a one-time expense and then I think that's all I was really interested, [indiscernible] are there any other one-time costs that you can probably, I know $7 million to $8 million for Wave 4, do you know how much of that is -- you said some of this will be pushed in to ‘16, do you have sort of a proportion that you could break out for us between what can we realize in ’15 and what?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Garrett</span></strong></p>
<p>The figure is probably $3 million to $4 million out of what I’ll call traditional Wave 4 and then Wave 4 Plus or Wave 4.5, if you will that extends into 2016 is an incremental $2 million to $3 million somewhere in that range. It’s just – other things that we can do to take a longer period of time and so we want to both identify those as we see those opportunities, but we will begin the implementation of those in 2015. You won’t see and we won’t see the impact of those until obviously the execution is done in the first half, call it generally the first half of 2016.</p>
<p>So I think that gives you a general sense of the breakout. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh Nahas</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. So the $2.5 million that you referenced in OpEx savings this quarter year-on-year, so that – if you look at that and say the previous Wave 3, I think was $9 million to $10 million, so we could view that as they got to go forward quarterly basis we should be seeing sort of continual $2.5 million savings until we get that 10, so we realized or that’s a reflection of the 10 going per quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Garrett</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, when you look at it year-over-year, what you have is, the Wave is going over the year and they build in terms of quarterly impact. So even Waves 2 and 3 had some impact as you moved through the year. So when you look at $2 million comparison year-over-year, there is already some of that in the prior year, so sometimes that number may look a little low, but when you take the [indiscernible] four quarters, it roughly equates to what we said we would be delivering in those.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh Nahas</span></strong></p>
<p>Attractiveness. No, I am just saying that’s such a good way to see that it was actually effective and realized. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>Good, absolutely. And I am – we will commit to you to continue to relentlessly pursue opportunities to integrate and consolidate and we have not run out of opportunities to do so, so just stay tuned and we’ll categorize those into the same buckets that we have before as we promote a One Mood overall that basically takes advantage of our scale and the synergies that are in front of us. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh Nahas</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. So I’ll connect with you on the progression of Wave.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Garrett</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from Todd Morgan, Jefferies. Todd, please go ahead. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Todd Morgan</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, good morning. I just wanted to follow-up on the site counts, you’re approaching sort of neutral total site count sequentially, and I know one of the parts of that was the sort of the local sales force productivity and size. I mean, is that really tracking the way you expected in that vein [ph] and I guess as we look forward, should we not expect to ultimately see absolute site growth sequentially? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, so Ken can address both of those, both in terms of the efforts that we’ve put forth in terms of local and expanding both through direct sales efforts as well as indirect and where we think that leads us, but we are sort of generally tracking to what we’ve seen in the past when we have concentrated and purposed our efforts on the build out of local and where we think we have depth in markets and particular opportunities. So Ken, go ahead. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ken Eissing</span></strong></p>
<p>Just to build – just a little on what Steve said, it is a – local rebuild is tracking along the lines that we expected it to. Like we said from the beginning when we started this off of about 18 months ago that it would take a two to three-year period to gradually rebuild it and do the productivity levels that made sense for the business and all that. We are beginning to see the pay-off of that, as we mentioned in our commentary, the year-over-year results were up nicely and we expect that will continue. </p>
<p>So that combined with the incremental, what I’d call, indirect distribution through partnerships and other channels, we think we’ll over time get to net site positive, we are not going to call it or exactly when that will occur, but that is clearly the goal and that’s what we set up to do 18 months ago, can get to a point where we were net site positive and stabilized ARPU and getting to see the stabilization of ARPU. And then the next step is obviously to get to net site positive, which we’re hopeful to do over the coming quarters. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Todd Morgan</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our last question comes from Jon Abodeely, XLCR. Jon, please go ahead. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Abodeely</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my questions. Steve, this was a question for you, as you think of Mood from a fifty-thousand foot view, some of the assets that you have that you could monetize, whether it be assets or the present technology that you guys put out at press release, are there things in the portfolio that still need shuffling that could create value? Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Richards</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, there are, and we continue to sort through where those are opportunities and we’ll continue to read out on those as we have progress points along the way, but I guess the short answer is yes and just stay tuned for more as we identify those opportunities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Abodeely</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks and good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Richards</strong></p>
<p>You’re welcome. So, Chris, back to you. So, I think thanks for everyone’s time today. We appreciate your interest in Mood. As you can see, our transformation of Mood is progressing steadily, leading to enhanced revenue and EBITDA performance, improved service delivery, and advanced solutions for our clients and prospects.</p>
<p>Our achievements are creating a more solid foundation upon which we can grow Mood value over the long-term. In the second quarter, Mood generated its third consecutive quarter of underlying revenue and EBITDA growth as adjusted for foreign exchange and asset disposals. Mood delivered a strong improvement in free cash flow relative to prior year. Mood substantially reduced non-productive one-timers and legacy issues that impacted Mood free cash flow previously and Mood completed the issuance of foreign sub-debt that enables us to repay the converts at maturity.</p>
<p>We see a bright future for Mood as we retool processes, reduce costs, transform our operations, develop new solutions, drive revenues and enhance free cash flow. Our efforts are considerable and wide ranging and our actions are showing through in underlying performance trends for the benefit of new shareholders and stakeholders.</p>
<p>We have significantly improved the operating cadence in the last four to six quarters with heightened performance in virtually every aspect of our business. We will be relentless in our pursuit of future opportunities to enrich returns from new shareholders and stakeholders. So, thanks very much for everyone’s time today. We look forward to our next call and we will be in touch. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes your conference call for today. We thank you for participating and ask that you please disconnect your lines. </p>
