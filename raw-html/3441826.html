<p>Thank you very much, Simon. And good morning, everyone. We have a lot of materials to cover today in the conference and therefore I'll precede it swiftly. Reminding everyone that this presentation contains forward-looking statements about ProMetic's objectives and strategies and the business we're involved with that involves risks and uncertainties.</p>
<p>On slide 3, I summarized the agenda we intend to cover today and following a brief introduction, Bruce will describe the financial of the quarter and then we'll provide an update on the plasma operation, give you an update on the clinical program between plasminogen and PBI-4050, and after recapping on the milestones for the second half of 2015, we'll open the conference for question and answer.</p>
<p>But on the following slide, guys, we are very excited about the progress made today. The first of this year, the second quarter has been rich in events that contributes the consolidated basis of ProMetic’s future.</p>
<p>I mean, financing leads the company in a very, very good financial position, along with secured orders which combines and with anticipated milestones will result on recognition of $20 million of revenue in the second half of 2015.</p>
<p>And this exclude obviously cash in flow from business development activity is currently under discussion. And we secured two agreements with Emergent, one for the production capacity contributing to long-term production capacity, but also contributing also immediately to the development capacity of ProMetic. And I will have four, five slides describing how transformational that relationship has become, added to our existing level of facility.</p>
<p>And as we announced yesterday morning, we completed the transaction to acquiring the first election center also in Winnipeg. So very exciting times, our dropped candidates plasminogen patient came up clean with no drug related side effect.</p>
<p>I mean this is fantastic and first PK indication, quite along the line we expected moving along to increase the dose now in PBI-4050 of course first 12 patients enrolled. I'll let John expand on that later in the presentation.</p>
<p>But why don’t we pass that on to Bruce now to cover the financials for the quarter. Bruce?</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Pritchard</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Pierre. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen. If we can move on now to slide number 6 in the slide deck and reminding everyone that this part of this morning’s webcast is based on the financial information for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014, as well as on the audited financial statements for year ended 31 December 2014.</p>
<p>All of these statements were prepared under IFRS. Annual information for the group information for the group and the quarterly reports can be found online at sedar.com. And all sums in today’s presentation are in thousands of Canadian dollars except for per share amounts or if otherwise indicated.</p>
<p>So if we move to slide 7, I'd like to start my part of this morning's presentation with the review of the revenues for the quarter which were $2.9 million compared to $4.4 million in the same quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>The analysis of the revenue reviews in the second quarter of 2015, $2.7 million of the revenue was generated from product sales, only slightly behind the $3.1 million from product sales in the same quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>The forecast number for half two, which I'll refer to shortly confirm our usual price that revenue do not accrue evenly from quarter-to-quarter and that annual comparison are more reliable indicator of our performance.</p>
<p>Service revenues were only $200,000 in the second quarter of 2015 compared to $1.3 million in the second quarter of '14, underlying the fact that this is no longer a core part of the business strategy as we focus on developing products to commercialize ourselves. There were no milestones or licensing revenues in the second quarter of either year.</p>
<p>If I turn now to the forecast, we're providing guidance as Pierre mentioned of revenues in the second half of 2015 are expected to exceed the $20 million, when combined with revenues for the first half, this confirms that we maintain guidance for the full year product sales of $20 million and revenue from service licensing and milestones to be around $5 million.</p>
<p>Its important to note however that this time we've excluded the impact of any revenues from business development transactions from this guidance and although these are currently under discussions the timing of revenue recognition for many of the dues remain uncertain at this time, so we've excluded it from the guidance.</p>
<p>As I now transition on to slide number 8 and some of the key figures from the profit and loss account for the second quarter. As discussed on the last slide, revenues were $2.9 million compared to $4.4 million for the second quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, product sales are growing $400,000 or 2.9% quarter-over-quarter and service revenues were $1.1 million lower during the same quarter of 2014. The reduction in product sales impacts on cost of goods sold which amounted to $1.3 million for the quarter compared to $2 million in the previous year.</p>
<p>Total research and development costs have increased over the same period in 2014, mainly due to the increase in clinical trial activity on both the small molecule and plasma pipelines. Total research and development cost was therefore $10.7 million in the quarter compared to $9.7 million in the same quarter in the previous year.</p>
<p>Administration costs rose in the second quarter, primarily as a result of increased headcount and business support functions, together with increased stock based compensation cost resulting from the higher stock price.</p>
<p>These effect combined to make admin cost in the second quarter of 2015 $3.8 million compared to $2.7 million in the same quarter of 2014. Finance costs were slightly lower year-on-year consistent with the level of financing activity undertaken.</p>
<p>The fair value adjustment on warrants was $2 million in the quarter and we described this is many quarters in the past. But this is the last time that these figures will impact the P&amp;L account on a quarterly basis as the warrants themselves became an equity instrument during the quarter following our annual meeting.</p>
<p>The loss on extinguishment of liabilities occurred as a result of the restructuring of the Thomvest loan and warrants details of which are fully explained in the notice to the financial statements, which you can find online at SEDAR.</p>
<p>And finally in 2014 as a result of our step up acquisition of NantPro, we recorded a gain on that transaction. And that gain was recorded in two lanes in the 2014 P&amp;L account and these will not recur in 2015 and that gain skews the comparison of the net loss period-to-period and they turned the Q2, 2014 loss of $8.9 million into profit of $23.4 million.</p>
<p>In this year the Q2 loss is $13.5 million reflecting the lower revenues, higher R&amp;D cost and one off debt reorganization charges. That loss competes to a net loss per share of $0.02 for the quarter on both the basic and diluted basis. Year-to-date adjusted EBITDA shows a loss of $11.5 million in Q2, 2015 versus a loss of $8.5 million for Q2 of 2014.</p>
<p>If I move now to slide number 9, and the key feature of the balance sheet at the end of the quarter. Cash stood at - strong at $56.7 million compared to $27.1 million at the end of previous year. Accounts receivable stood at $6.7 million compared to $11.8 million in December 2014 and the main reason for the fall in accounts receivable was the receipt of the Generium upfront payment which was invoiced at the end of 2014, and collected in Q1 of 2015.</p>
<p>Capital assets have risen by around $3 million since December, representing mainly the ongoing investment in our manufacturing capability and Laval and on the Isle of Man. Intangible assets have remained unchanged $146 million and the main thing everyone that these include $141 million recognized in relation to the acquisition of NantPro during 2014.</p>
<p>Trade and other payables are down by $2 million to $7.1 million due to the payments of the first half of the year. The warrant liability which was $24.7 million at the year end has now been commuted to equity as a result of the change in the Thomvest warrant, resulting in a significant improvement in the level of current liabilities on our balance sheet.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the long-term debt provided by Thomvest, shown here at $20.9 million has reduced slightly as a result of both the debt modification and the repayment of debt and exchange for equity subscribed in the quarter.</p>
<p>And lastly, we've got the deferred tax liability on the balance sheet of $34.5 million relating to the recognition of the NantPro intangible and the payment differencess between the book value of our asset as a value for tax purposes.</p>
<p>So altogether, these results significantly improved the balance sheet bringing total equity to $166.6 million, up from $104.4 million at December and the total asset figure to $235.9 million from $203.4 million at December 2014. So overall and solid base from which to continue building.</p>
<p>And on that note, I'll hand back to Pierre who will provide some detail of the business update.</p>
<p><strong>Pierre Laurin</strong></p>
<p>All right. Bruce, thank you very much for that and again as we say strengthening the balance sheet and combined with your – with our guidance for the base business to see $20 million in an excellent position to execute on our plan and on that note I'll take you to slide 11.</p>
<p>As we made announcements back in May and just as recent that’s yesterday, on our relationship with Emergent by solution and this transaction is transformational and I don’t think that we've given it enough time for our shareholders to appreciate what it means.</p>
<p>So on slide 11 I summarize the two transactions. The first one that was announced in May is providing us access to Emergent's FDA license plasma facility, plasma production facility in Winnipeg.</p>
<p>It provides immediate additional development capacity, it enables us to scale up and prepare GMP batches for additional IND filings without disrupting our current Prometic Laval facility operating under GMP condition or for plasminogen and IVIG and it enables also to do a further five times scale up of that size compared to our Laval facility.</p>
<p>So as we progress we're not only adding more INDs in the pipeline, but also further scaling up our process under GMP condition. And obviously as we explained before, over time and for the next 15 years it provides an additional 250,000 liter plasma processing capacity annually.</p>
<p>So this combines with our Laval to bring us to about 400,000 liters of plasma processing capacity as a base, part of which is already in North America built, operational and FDA licensed. So extremely strong contribution to our business plan.</p>
<p>The second acquisition, the second transaction ladder is the acquisition of Emergent plasma collection center in Winnipeg. That is now owned by ProMetic and it has FDA and Health Canada licensed to operate and collect plasma.</p>
<p>It contributes to our management of plasma supply chain and further vertical integration. The plasma collection center can be used as blueprint for future centers and the plasma collection center provide access to specialty plasma.</p>
<p>So all in all, two important transactions, but importantly I will say on slide 12, I like to – exemplify how significant this is. On slide 12 you can see that its over to build a new Greenfield facility. It would be at cost of $150 million. It will take 3 years to build and be validated and throughout that time it doesn’t provide any capacity to our development of the pipeline, it doesn’t contributes anything to being able to advance more INDs and more product in the clinics and the capacity only becomes available in 2018.</p>
<p>Now this deal had a cost of approximately about $5 million per year for the first 2, 3 years. The capacity is readily available for scale up. It provides additional GMP manufacturing for our clinical trial in addition to Laval and its enabling us to ramp up multiple commercial launches and has on the 2018 plan to go which is start Greenfield .</p>
<p>Now remember that and we'll talk about that later. But should come online as well by 2018 available and part of Generium capacity to add to our 400,000 liter. But I mean, this a major, major transaction for both companies.</p>
<p>I mean, for us certainly in the sense that facility license is underutilized by Emergent and we can retrofit our platform technology, add that facility and actually work with people who are extremely experienced as track record of the improved product and can understand and be trained very well to end our platform technology.</p>
<p>So that being said, when you look on slide 13 what it means is that processes, products are being developed in Rockville, Maryland. They are now being tech transferred also to Laval and in addition depending on the portion, the size decide and where it is for Q4 sequential development to Winnipeg. And therefore those two facility will actually - they will be working in sync and progressing more INDs.</p>
<p>This is again, further exemplified on slide 14, our three product Fibrinogen, Alpha1-antitrypsin and C1 Esterase Inhibitor will be accelerated, scaled off and prepared for filing of INDs early next year and that deal with Emergent contributes that additional development capacity.</p>
<p>Overall, I want to summarize what this whole means. Our business strategy on page 15 is focused on a sequential development and commercialization of high value biopharmaceutical.</p>
<p>So as we add products to our pipeline and products become subsequently approved for sale, our net sales output per liter plasma increases significantly and now you can see their revenue line curve is quite easy to understand at that point.</p>
<p>Its each product contributing a value or sales per liter plasma time, the 400,000 liter capacity that’s already exist between Winnipeg and Laval and you have that kind of straight line that indicates the growth of that business as those products come online. And this excludes, as I mentioned before the capacity from Winnipeg and Generium is expected to kick in as well by 2018.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Pritchard</strong></p>
<p>Yes, and Pierre its probably worth just reiterating of course that capacity is obviously driven by the volume and requirements for a high value proteins and should we - as we go forward require additional capacity, we can bring that online if we have the flexibility of using that capacity from Winnipeg and Generium to help us with that.</p>
<p><strong>Pierre Laurin</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. And I think those we have also in slide 17 for sure there is a series of picture that were sent - taken actually on the site in Russia where the construction as demands as far as the partner in Russia, they are planning to complete the construction of the building by the end of the year. So that they can continue during the [indiscernible] they have just like us with the completion of that facility during the winter in house, in side.</p>
<p>So you can see the size of the plant. That plant we will be able to accommodate capacity of 600,000 liter of plasma and well underway to be ready in operational and contribute by late '17, '18. So quite exciting time on many fronts with the plasma business.</p>
<p>But I'd like to invite John perhaps to comment on our flagship product Plasminogen John? On slide 18.</p>
<p><strong>John Maron</strong></p>
<p>Yes. And it’s my pleasure to take you to slide 18 to talk about Plasminogen. [Indiscernible] we have them all ready. We are making really good progress there, as you probably know we see often drag designation from the European community and we've finished the first series of patients with the lowest dose - single dose without any significant adverse event.</p>
<p>In fact no drug related adverse events at all and we're starting up the second cohort and we expect to complete that fairly quickly because we have patients who are being hanging back to make sure that the drug is safe for their end of the trial</p>
<p>So in second half of 2015 to talk about, slide 18 further, we expect to complete the high dose. We expect to find nothing unusual in the pharmacokinetics and we expect to be starting Phase II/III and we also expect during this half of the year to get permission to extend our studies in Europe. And the very important last pull up point relating to develop another indication for Plasminogen in separate, unlike in general Plasminogen deficiency. </p>
<p>Slide 19 to talk about our current sequence of clinical trials with our laid compound PBI-4050. As you know we've completed successfully the Phase I in normal volunteers up to 2400 milligrams with no significant adverse events.</p>
<p>We completed a similar trial in patients with advanced kidney disease which showed no change in the pharmacokinetics, very helpful finding and no significant adverse events again.</p>
<p>We are now in the middle of a trial with type III diabetes and metabolic syndrome, rather important indication given that one third of Americans have the metabolic syndrome as of today. We have 12 patients enrolled. We are going to have a meeting shortly to decide whether its safe to add more patients. We expect that meeting to occur before the end of this month and I think we will be moving forward.</p>
<p>We will be getting some preliminary data on the biomarkers showing us with a actually affecting the metabolic syndrome and the diabetes before the end of this year.</p>
<p>And slide 20, the rest of the things that are keeping us very busy and initiating a clinical trial Phase II open label in United Kingdom and orphan indication of patients with significant metabolic syndrome, we will be providing preliminary results in the first half of 2016. That study may be extended based on what results we see. Its very much an orphan indication and we expect that we will have accelerated pathway for improvement.</p>
<p>Starting in United States, sorry in Canada we have a trial ongoing, open label, Phase II study of Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis, again we have been granted orphan designation in the United States for this drug, for this indication and we are planning to extend that study as time goes on.</p>
<p>We are moving to the United States. We have set up a pre-IND meeting with the FDA to discuss the Idiopathic Pulmonary Fibrosis indication and what would be require d for pivotal trails in United States.</p>
<p>And the last trial we are developing right now is patients with diabetic nephropathy as they share it with type II diabetes and that will be a multi center study in both Canada and United Sates. We've talked to many investigators already and hopefully we will first randomized placebo control trial to get started. We might have a meeting with the Food and Drug Administration to make sure they are happy with trial protocol and then we look at them.</p>
<p>So Pierre, you cold summarize please slide…</p>
<p><strong>Pierre Laurin</strong></p>
<p>Well, yes. I mean John thank you for that. I have to say that the last three slides really summarize what to expect for the second half of this year. As John just said on the Plasminogen front on slide 21, total [ph] confirmation of safety profile at higher dose which then enable us to provide an optimal dosage regimen and cross over to our Phase II/III program and that should all happen during the second.</p>
<p>And as John mentioned initiating a clinical trial in Europe that’ where all countries to accelerating the program over all. I am very excited look forward to share with you where we are going with Plasminogen next. This is an additional medical indications and we're on the Qs away from the - on dealing the master plan on this one, exciting prospect for our flagship product Plasminogen.</p>
<p>IVIG, we're back and forth with the FDAs, I think enrollments at the primary decision, patients on IVIG in US and in Russia very shortly. This should have started earlier in the year, but again we have put buffers in our own critical path assessment and it doesn’t change anything in terms of our expected BLA filing and commercial launch for 2018.</p>
<p>Something to watch very closely, obviously the success will get transferred to Emergent, Winnipeg facility. A lot riding on this, as three key drugs are being scaled up and being prepared for IND filing in 2016 and that will then bring the total of late stage clinical trial program to five from the plasma derived products and then [indiscernible] by our PBI-4050 programs, which is again summarized on the side 22 and the Metabolic Syndrome.</p>
<p>What to expect therefore, we expect the drug safety medical board to confirm that they are okay with the safety profile and enabling the expansion of the trial. And look forward to be in a position to preliminary review the clinical data by the end of the year as John indicated.</p>
<p>The pre-IND meeting with the FDA for IPF is in the coming weeks, is very, very important. We have some great ideas and we're - I want to share with the FDA if they are on par with us and if so then our Canadian program will expand in US and we will get ready for the pivotal IPF study.</p>
<p>Same for chronic kidney disease. We've already at a meeting with the FDA for chronic kidney disease. There is some fine tuning on the protocol that John went through. We reassured again with the FDA, but would be in positions to file our IND for both IPF and chronic kidney disease this coming quarter.</p>
<p>And excited about the prospect of this orphan indication in Europe, and again orphan indication, smaller number of patients maybe required to show evidence of efficacy because the risk benefit is very, very different when you have a ultra rare disease. Excited to potentially contribute to the quality and life those patients, and look forward to more on that.</p>
<p>And we submitted seven abstract to the American Society of Nephrology, and they all been accepted. So we will quite busy with several presentations of new data at the American Society of Nephrology meeting in November, as well as presentation at the American Heart Association a week after.</p>
<p>So busy Q4 in terms of product development with luxury milestone. And to sum it up on the operation side, just again reminding everyone combination of product sales, service revenue and reorganization of some milestone bringing it to 20 million by end of second half and that excludes business development.</p>
<p>And our shareholders should expect us to continue and close them, some of the current discussions on business development that contribute a combination of financial, current contribution to our development to help us access complimentary nuance and intellectual properties and improve the value of our pipeline asset and to provide us access to market.</p>
<p>So that’s it’s from us for now and perhaps we can switch over to the question and answer period. Operator?</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Alan Ridgeway from Scotiabank. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alan Ridgeway</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good morning, guys. Thanks a lot for taking the question. Could you guys just confirm as a bookkeeping kind of thing, just confirm the guidance for me. So the second half of the year you're expecting total revenue of greater than $20 million which includes the $5 million of milestones and service or is it you're expecting $20 million of resin sales in the back-half plus the $5 million?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>So Alan, just a -- its $20 million in total for the second half, total revenues for the year to be at least $25 million. Of this two year revenues $20 million of the $25 million will be the product sales and that matches the guidance that we’ve given earlier and then the residual $5 million will be milestones and service revenue.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alan Ridgeway</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, okay. Great, thanks. I just wanted to make sure I had that right. Okay. And then, maybe just on the R&amp;D spending front, so if I look at the numbers for the quarter and annualize, looks like the 4050 program is at about $10 million run rate, the Plasma program at about $30 million run rate. You’ve got a lot of additional trials coming online particularly I think if you end up having a positive meeting on IPF with the U.S. and may be filing IND's around an expanded program there. Can you just talk to sort of where those levels could go as the programs continue to mature?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, on the Plasma front, I think that one has to take into account that we have at least two, three cost contributing to what is it look -- seem to be R&amp;D, right? We have our existing manufacturing in the allowance plus now the Winnipeg capacity that is labeled as R&amp;D and obviously driving the cost for developing the clinical trial.</p>
<p>But when we are adding additional clinical trials, they are not necessarily linear, some of those trial are as you know Alan, involve a small number of patients. The IVIG trial is spread over, the cost of it is spread over two years and most program actually are spread over two years and they are about $4 million, $5 million a piece, spread over two years. So they're not -- its not like you’re adding or tripling the cost of R&amp;D as we add a new protein.</p>
<p>The both of the cost at this point in time actually as could be pointed to all the manufacturing, the GMP, the preparation of the IND, the stability, all that cost is in part of our infrastructure that enables it, right? So as we add more product, don’t expect like double and triple of that cost line.</p>
<p>It is going to increase, but its manageable with our increase in revenue and we're looking very closely to synchronize some of our business development activities to assist on that front, right? I mean there's some partnership that we’re looking to close that will be quite helpful to contribute to offset or contribute to such cost.</p>
<p>On the PBI-4050, again, we are very, very much focused on demonstrating proof of concept once step at a time, we are reassesses, we are in extensive discussion with several parties interested in partnering PBI-4050.</p>
<p>So this is again a dynamic space that -- we're proceeding aggressively and cautiously at the same time, right? The objective number one is, to prove that we move the needle with biomarkers and demonstrate translation of activity from animal to humans.</p>
<p>Now the clinical trial expansion that will require significant funding are the two that we'll be filing IND for, late this year, IPs and CKD, and we would probably really engage full course in 2016, 2017, having already on hand proof of concept data. So probably a very different picture all over, corporately and partner wise. So, Bruce you want to add anything to this?</p>
<p><strong>A – Bruce Pritchard</strong></p>
<p>No. I mean I think you’ve covered it, I mean I think we gave guidance sometime ago by R&amp;D spend for the year, I don’t expect just to exceed that this year, I think your indication of the proof of our expenditure by now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alan Ridgeway</span></strong></p>
<p>And so just, Pierre, maybe on the last comment you made about the two files the IPF and the CKD, just to close off the loop. If you were to drive ahead with the randomized trial and CKD and potentially a larger program for IPs, I’m assuming with the 150 or so patients here at this forecasting for the CKD, it'd be at least big on the IPs, how -- are we talking $30 million to $50 million to run both studies?</p>
<p>At which point then would you actively or aggressively look to partner that at this point or how are you thinking about that as you’re looking into next year? And I’ll leave it there, thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, Alan, it is going to be interesting to see how things develop. Obviously a lot of interest around our compound, it's a safe compound, it's orally active, it's a once a day, everybody is on the edge, they are watching is this going to translate into movement on biomarkers.</p>
<p>We can’t take it all on our own, that's the obvious statement and we’re looking at optimal way of partnering this, we’re talking to a lot of interested companies and each one having their own preference on how something could be structured, but be under no illusion, this is a program that one we're not alone, deep partnered.</p>
<p>There are some indication that would probably make sense that we could hang on to and do a very good job of developing and commercializing. There's other indication that are clearly achieved by the kiosk, because if we show efficacy in the cardio renal metabolic type of patients, as John indicated, huge indication and probably more akin to a multinational infrastructure to continue developing and commercializing.</p>
<p>So, it’s a complex set of circumstances that will drive forward the decision, but those decisions we made about incurring cost on clinical trials, they're not to be made now, what we have to do is just set the scene, design the protocol according to the best inputs from the world experts and take advise from the FDA and EMA, and set the stage such that we could execute on our own and or in partnership. Right? So, stay tuned, it's exciting time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alan Ridgeway</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that makes sense. Thanks a lot guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Neil Maruoka with Canaccord Genuity. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Maruoka</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just first on plasminogen, how many patients are interested in starting in the Phase 2, 3, and if you’re up at the 18 patient level they need to have the cross over to Europe, and then the second part of that is can you outline your filing strategy for plasminogen and are you consider rolling BLA?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>I can answer part of those questions only, and Neil thank you for the questions. As John, indicated when we invite patients much waited to be on the trial, we had probably a ratio of 80% of them preferring to be in the Phase 2, 3 trial and the Phase 1 trial.</p>
<p>So the factor been recruiting a lot of motivated patients to be part of the program, but the majority of them that elected to wait for the first results, no not those first results are very, very convincing in terms of safety and therefore will help bring the other one online in the program.</p>
<p>So this program of Phase 1, 2, 3 like that for not so rare condition, rare diseases, is almost seamless like you go from one to another step, it's not as formal as having to regroup all the data, the FDA has already agreed to the protocol of Phase 2, 3 and the question here is more to do with reconnecting with the FDA and making sure that the dose that we chose is agreeable to them before we formally seek with the dose regimen optimization part of the trial.</p>
<p>So we're looking again, the BLA to be filed. It's going to be very expensive in terms of CMC section which has been reviewed already for the IND, and it’s a pharmacokinetic study, right, monitoring adverse events but a pharmacokinetic study and the uncertain point very well established, incremental of 10% above baseline as it's very good endpoint to fix the objective for licensure. So, fairly straight forward program.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Maruoka</span></strong></p>
<p>And just on the rolling BLA, have you had discussions with the FDA since your CMC section is probably largely complete?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, what happened here is that the FDA invites company like us in condition such as plasminogen deficiency to have constant contact, so we’ll updating the FDA with the course one, the first dose and already engaged in discussing what else could we be doing. FDA is really eager to see company advancing safely, therapies -- especially in conditions that there is no solution .So the precise profit – exact profit will be refined as we meet the FDA again this summer.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Maruoka</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right. And your PPPS processes is optimized for, I think its about 12 products, but you only disclosed a handful including plasminogen IVIG, what considerations you've taken to account as you move the next products forward from here, is that partnerships or whether it's an orphan drug or not? And do you have any concerns as you look to optimizing more products within that processes, how difficult is it to move product number 13, 14, and 15 and take into your optimized process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, yes, there is a limit to how many products you want to make out of a single leader plasma, but we were very, very keen to make sure that before we locked in the backbone we would make sure that we were okay on, as you mentioned between 12 to 14 products. So -- and how do you chose, which one to move forward is the combination of a lot of factors, and I will name some, they're not necessarily more important than the other. They are all important, but obviously manufacturing technology regimes -- some products sometime are more already quicker for scale up and entering the clinical trial.</p>
<p>There is also the logic of some products being launched commercially as much as possible simultaneously so they become good companion products and generate a decent cash flow that contributes to the overall growth of the company. And two products that meet that criteria was the IVIG and also Alpha1-Antitrypsin for now. They won’t be necessarily our flagship core products for us, but they will contribute significantly to the cash flow and will support plasminogen overall combined P&amp;L.</p>
<p>We always look at freedom to operate the patent minefield and make sure that we can create some of our own and sometime we're going to be working a little bit more on creating a unique aspect of the product before we actually formally launch. So combination of all of those, but in reality we have a core group that has a certain capacity and now that core group has launched its first wave of product and it's been developing the second wave of product when Winnipeg is receiving the tech transfer, they will then get on to the third wave of product and this is where we can announce other often drug candidates. So it’s a sequential process that is driven by all those factors put together.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Maruoka</span></strong></p>
<p>And are you still on track to announce a couple of more products in the near term?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. That's what we want ProMetic to be positioned in. I mean even though we drive protein from plasma, we're not per say a plasma fractionator. We are not out there to compete with Baxter CSL in the business that they're doing very well at.</p>
<p>We will see some products, some core hospital commodity products, but not in a matter that is a head-to-head competition where we are seeking to take huge market share, these are more decent revenue contributing to our overall platform and growth. but ProMetic will be much more known for its orphan products and its positioning taking boots on the ground, marketing and link those product at least domestic markets for us to deal is in North American. Right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Maruoka</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great, and last question on fibrinogen, you can manufacture that product and have plans to launch that in for non-pharmaceutical purposes, can you give us an update on where you are there and with any customer discussions that you have had?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I mean fibrinogen, I’ll explain it well, there is two kind of life to it, there is an existing status fibrinogen preventing as commercially available for use as an ingredient to be part of another company’s product and be a device, biologic group, amateurs, and therefore we can supply those products to those company readily.</p>
<p>We're in discussions with two group of companies, two group of clients or licensees. One typically has products already on the market and they are looking at us supplying them a new generation of fibrinogen or becoming a second supply when they want to de-risk their own current supply. So that’s a group of companies, and the other group of companies are developing new products needing fibrinogen as part as their offering and those two are being pushed forward.</p>
<p>So we expect impact of this gradually and it doesn’t require regulatory approval for us. But we also intent to have fibrinogen approved per se as an IV drug for the treatment of bleeding and there is cleaner pathway that has been established for this. This will become disclosed fairy shortly as well in late Q3-Q4.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Maruoka</span></strong></p>
<p>So do you think, you'll see some sales in the non-pharmaceutical use in the second half of the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>A little bit marginal, but more and more significant in 2016. So in 2016, as our overall business grows we expect to see fibrinogen contribute more meaningfully. We may get there as well with plasminogen if we're lucky if the review is fast enough, and then to hit part of 2016 pretty much consensus with sales starting more meaningfully at plasminogen in 2017. But all of those are like lumping ahead as we advance our deals and/or invent the product in development.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Maruoka</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great, thank you.</p>

<p><strong>Q – Doug Cooper</strong></p>

<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Doug, I missed the question.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Sanjay Jha with Panmure Gordan. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sanjay Jha</span></strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon gents. Most of my questions have been answered, but can I just ask couple of things on the plasmocyte. Now it's been a few months now since you've had Laval facility up and running. What been your experience, you had been giving out some yield projections on what you might achieve. Are you still happy with those, have you seen anything that have been positive for ProMetic, anything that's been negative that you might have seen from your experience in Lava?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It’s an interesting question. Obviously there has been problem, it didn’t come to my attention. I'm sure we have very experience in vaccinated Senior Management there, they've seen it before, launch products before, dealt with the FDA and regulators before. And that probably speaks to two things that ProMetic do have a very robust platform.</p>
<p>Let's not forget that we have been involved in the CMC section and the manufacturing process of some of the most sophisticated biopharmaceutical products where companies came to ask to help them manufacture those products albeit in those years in the past we are mostly involved in the bio-separation of it, but that’s key for biologic since the bio-separation is key and that’s all we're doing here with plasma products.</p>
<p>Plasma and the proteins in the plasma are made by humans. So what do you have there is a bio-separation blade, and that’s our strength. So on that front we are very, very well positioned and then people that are working at ProMetic have long term experience of developing those type of products, several products currently in the market developed by our existing players.</p>
<p>It has been no surprise, it's been working well because it's been a long, long planning. We've been added for so many years, not to say we won’t come across some challenges and so on but, I mean again, it’s a good question, and actually work reminding ourselves that no. I mean things have been running rather smoothly considering.</p>
<p>Let people look at this as a new process, fair enough. But for us this is a 25 year old new process. We've been working with this process for various proteins for 25 years. Right so, its not such a challenge as some may think from the outside</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sanjay Jha</span></strong></p>
<p>And can I – my second question is as it relates to imagine the plasma production facility in Winnipeg is this probably one of a good. How do I model this because obviously you have Laval.</p>
<p>And you have got production and you have cost, but how do we do something like Emergent where you have a strategic relationship with them. We have been using their facility.</p>
<p>So how do we look at think of kind of cost in terms of modeling it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Good question Sanjay, we’re graphing with same locating for that ourself right now, but we’re looking right now the IFRS goods permitting is that we’re going to be looking at the cost in two component parts.</p>
<p>So if you recall the announcement regarding the deal we have a kind of minimum annual commitment that we’re paying to Emergent for our access to the facility that’s made up of two essentially to components.</p>
<p>There’s an element of that provides us with the minimum number of employees and there’s an element of that provides the access to facilities the overhead essentially the easy thing to do I think is to take that minimum annual commitment and straight line it over 12 again and through the P&amp;L again because it will be there it will be a P&amp;L charge.</p>
<p>As we begin to ramp up production at the facility we will exceed that minimum payment on the cost for how we go forward from there will not be incurred through the P&amp;L again and on the straight line basis.</p>
<p>There will be kind of booked as incurred. So as we’re running large scale production runs and we have cost they will be booked there. And again if you recall that we’ve we have access to the facility.</p>
<p>But it’s not access to the facility a 100% of the time we have certain amount of time in the facility. So you will see chunks of additional revenue. As far as other stage we’re not in a position to give more details on that on who those cost are going to accrue.</p>
<p>But because we haven’t yet ourselves booked all the production more so and more time the production program. But base line fixed cost straight line number of our 12 months could be far row. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sanjay Jha</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, all right. Thanks Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Doug Miehm with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Miehm</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning yeah one has been asked and answered, but I do have a few questions. Number one, with respect to the potential deals that you’re looking at 40, 50 side peer what type what’s the hurdle like what have been or what type of data are potential partners looking to get in hand before a final deal could consummated?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>What Bruce it’s Doug I’m sorry we could have done deals before and it was a question of as we have been in the weak position and needing badly a deal to fund the company we could have done that.</p>
<p>But as we progress overall corporately we want to bring the company to the soft spot and the soft spot is really as you know between Phase 1 Phase 2 as some evidence of the translation is present due that the partner increase a value everybody is happy.</p>
<p>And still ability for the partner to have some valuable input in the 11 program. So it’s interesting that we seen that the soft spot for an optimal deal for both partners is in somewhere during the Phase 2 that necessary post pivotal Phase 2 but during the Phase 2 right so we’ve been entertaining a lot of discussion that everyone due diligence and so on.</p>
<p>And then you get to know the other partners as well what their weakness what did they like none everybody want the same indication some are interested in lungs, some are interested in kidney, some interested in the diabetes aspect.</p>
<p>So and we’re blessed and cursed by a product like PPPS 40,50, because it deals with fibrosis. And fibrosis is involved in virtually every bloody disease. It’s the end game of how a tissue or an organ doesn’t itself does not regenerate and start to kind of slowly down performing an dying.</p>
<p>So it is a metrics and we’re looking very favorably for geographical type of deal we have a territory such as Japan for example with the more easily carved out a certain amount of territories like that.</p>
<p>And so looking by indication by territory and using that period for what I would call the mutual due diligence. So make sure that signing the deal is only the beginning of a long journey.</p>
<p>You want to make sure that that asset is not only partnered by is well partnered and that the partnership that just bring money but brings where at all to increase the other success. So it’s a process we’re well engaged in.</p>
<p>And with the book with that I said for sure and we want to make sure we do it right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Miehm</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay on IPF like already you are going to have your day meeting in September we’ve at the results of that. What are the next steps depending on what the outcome is in moving towards that pivotal program.</p>
<p>And what I mean by that is what do you need to see from them and when is the likely estate to commence that pivotal trial?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Well two minimum two objectives there with the DA first is to make sure that if we elect to we could file a 19 US and add US sites to our existing Canadian trial. And are some interested site are our radar would like to jump that.</p>
<p>And but the question that we have if DA pertains the fact that there’s now two drug that have been approved first weakness pulmonary fibrosis nintedanib and pirfenidone. And everybody have seen there’s also how in a animal model we outperformed those two drugs, which drugs have reduction of fibrosis.</p>
<p>And in particular the combination with pirfenidone showed extreme reduction of fibrosis like synergy between those two drug. So you can see where I’m going with this is that we’re going to have some interesting questions asked at NDA whether do it allow the combination trial to start earlier for the benefit of the patients.</p>
<p>And that maybe a signaling that we could be heading a path that require less patients to get an answer that is meaningful to patients and to who makes your orders. So what you can expect from the NDA meeting is for us to have any adds up any green any issues that they may have is before we file the IND to expand the trial game trial and we could actually if you now listen Q4 already to kick in coming back from the NDA.</p>
<p>Because again this is not going to be the first time that the agency have seen the CNC section of the product and when we met with the FDA with [indiscernible] this time we’re meeting the FDA would be pulmonary lung division.</p>
<p>And orphan drug designation profile. So and except where we’ll update everyone mid September and to be rolling into those programs as early as October and November.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Miehm</span></strong></p>
<p>So this I’m clear do you think you could start a pivotal program by November?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>No. The rolling the Canadian study - and when you open the - </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Miehm</span></strong></p>
<p>Into the U.S. and then getting data and then not turning a pivotal to probably early 2017?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>No, the pivotal could start much earlier than that the pivotal could start in the first half of 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Miehm</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, perfect. Now my final question just has to be with. You are generating a significant amount of what looks like important data. But I don't think it’s been published yet in significant journal what can you tell me about how you’re thinking about publishing some of these data that you’re generating?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s been a planned wall in my office. We’re planning to call it open the [indiscernible] and start publishing along with some reputable institution that has cross validated our own data repeating our model and/or doing reinstruction their own model such as - the Montreal Heart Institute Board of which has generated astounding data supporting our claims.</p>
<p>So there’s manuscript that have been prepared to be submitted. So it’s difficult to say when those will be published Doug as each publications have their own review time period due time that the first, but we expect just as of November when we’ll be reveling new data and making new presentation seven presentation at the American Society of Nephrology.</p>
<p>Two presentation at American Heart Association in November and probably on that time maybe just a bit after some initial publications where more is reveled about mechanism of action and prereview the article - and prereview his journals yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Miehm</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks very much. That was great.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Doug.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Jim Belin with Aldebaran Asset Management. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim Belin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking my question. I’d like to know how is Plasminogen administered and how long does the dose of Plasminogen last in a human before another dose is needed?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for the question. It’s an IVIG infusion at this point in time and where we’ll be disclosing the PK profile later this fall. We want to make sure that we answer very critical question, which is does the PK change is it dose dependent.</p>
<p>And you need critical math let's say 12 individuals to create a fair sophisticated representatives profile. So where we have pretty good idea where this is going, we can model it but now we're going to be populating it with additional data in the coming weeks, coming months. And we’ll be revealing the data this fall. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim Belin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And also I had a question last fall there was a resins contract which was due to aspire and I had asked the question on one of the calls about what's the status of this and I was told that discussions are continuing. I’m curious was that contract in fact extended or it was a new contract entered into.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pierre Laurin</span></strong></p>
<p>Bruce.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes but actually I wonder, the answer is discussions are ongoing nearing conclusion. We expect that to be extended and we expect to and makes that fairly soon. And what I would say is that, we just want to make sure as we’re negotiating extension to these contracts, that the terms are favorable for us and we as a company are on a different position from where we used to be and we want to make sure that we get the best commercial terms.</p>
<p>So I think it's taking a bit of a long time, but we’re getting closed in.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim Belin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Pritchard</span></strong></p>

As you saw in the recap, several milestones and we’ll be into their conference call when we update with significant news. We'll take the time to set with cash afterwards make sure that all those questions that you may have surrounding news and updates are addressed.</p>
<p>And we will look out forward to squeezing in Analyst Day wrestling a bit on the best time to do this later this fall. But again a lot of exciting development for coming and look forward to other exchanges in the time. Thank you again everyone.</p>
