<p>So as in usual way we've got our presentation, we'll run through with you today and at the end we'll be very happy to take your questions.</p>
<p>So if we turn to Page 4 of the presentation, I'll provide you with a brief summary. Cairn's strategy is straightforward. We seek to deliver sustainable value growth for shareholders from a balanced E&amp;P portfolio.</p>
<p>So on the one hand we have a combination of cash and future cash flow from our mature basin position in the U.K. and Norway and on the other we've exposure to material positions in frontier and emerging basin with Senegal obviously currently the full area focus for us.</p>
<p>The current oil price environment presents challenges to the industry, but it also presents opportunities. Against the backdrop of the Indian tax issues and falling oil prices, we took early action last year to reduce costs in the Group.</p>
<p>As a result, we remain fully funded to deliver all of our strategic objectives to allocate capital to value enhancing projects and to benefit from an environment to reduce operational cost. Importantly in assessing the balance of political, technical and commercial risks across our asset portfolio, we targeted assets and remain robust in a low oil price environment with attractive breakevens.</p>
<p>Let me give you a brief update on the Indian tax issue where the tax authorities continue to enforce restriction upon our shareholding in Cairn India. Its 20 months since the investigation began and Cairn is doing everything possible to press the resolution and to move the process forward.</p>
<p>We would like the Indian Government to move to arbitration so that we have clarity in the process. We remain very clear on the strength of our legal position on this issue, which we have confirmed as fence to India, but we cannot today provide you with a clear time table for resolution.</p>
<p>We do however believe that early resolution is in the best interest of all parties and the clarity would allow the international investment community to see that India is looking to resolve these retrospective tax cases as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>In that context we understand that there is to be a meeting of an Inter Ministerial Group comprising of law, external affairs and finance to provide a response to our arbitration notice. So we look forward to receiving an update from them and we will of course provide you with updates as and when matters progress.</p>
<p>Turning to Senegal, we received Government agreement for an extensive evaluation plan that will seek to access currently estimated full block potential of gross mean risked resource in excess of a billion barrels. Our drilling campaign is scheduled to commence in October of this year with the Ocean Athena and will comprise of up to six wells.</p>
<p>Three of those wells firm and Richard will provide more detail on them later in the presentation and three are contingent.</p>
<p>Our coring within the program will be to prove up the commerciality of the SNE-1 discovery. In addition, we surely commence an extensive 3D seismic survey acquisition that will help us to further define the full potential of this acreage.</p>
<p>We remain very excited about the significant value proposition in Senegal and we look forward to providing updates as the program progresses.</p>
<p>With that introduction I'll now hand over to James to provide an overview on funding.</p>
<p><strong>James Smith</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Simon and good morning, everyone.</p>
<p>So if we turn to Slide 6 first of all for an update on the Group's funding position and our projected uses of capital. At midyear cash on the balance sheet was $725 million and $575 million reserve base lending bank facility was undrawn and remains undrawn.</p>
<p>As we guided through previously we had expected to up to around $300 million of that facility to fund the U.K. development projects with the bulk of the balance available in the form of letters of credit and performance guarantees and other operational bonuses.</p>
<p>Our projected capital expenditure for the full committed exploration and appraisal program is $170 million with a clear focus on Senegal and our projected capital expenditure on development projects from midyear this year through the end of 2017 that's on Catcher and Kraken is $615 million taking those projects through to free cash flow given that they come on stream in 2017.</p>
<p>So as you can see, the Group is fully funded to deliver the upcoming appraisal and exploration program focused on Senegal and to take the business through our development projects ramping up from 2017 to peak net production to Cairn of 22,000 barrels a day and thereafter obviously delivering cash flows to support the future strategy.</p>
<p>Simon has already spoken about India. Clearly our engagement there continues to be a key priority given the value of our investment. We're pushing ahead with arbitration of the U.K. Investment Treaty and we'll update the market in due course, but the important point to note here is that the business plan is fully funded from existing financial resources regardless of the timing of resolution of that dispute in India.</p>
<p>So turning to the next slide to give a bit more of a breakdown on the expected capital costs, you can see there on the left hand chart, the focus on Senegal, that $130 million represents the 3D seismic acquisition program that was commenced shortly as well as the three well drilling program that will span from Q4 this year and into 2016.</p>
<p>That guidance is a slight increase from the $95 million previously guided at the prelim stage and that reflects and expanded scope of what we aim to achieve in particular an extensive data acquisition program from the wells including flow testing and coring that will maximize the certainty regarding reservoir resource base and in particular focus on establishing commerciality of the SNE discovery.</p>
<p>Richie will come and obviously he will talk about that in more detail.</p>
<p>The bulk of the balance of the NA program is in Northwest Europe and that represents seismic acquisition, pre-drill CapEx on some commitment wells as well as the predevelopment cost. All of that activity is focused around the core areas we have around the existing discovered resource base in the North Sea.</p>
<p>One point to make about these forecasts which is we always give the Norway expenditure net of the tax rebate there and there is obviously an ongoing working capital point around that. You'll see from the accounts that we have in respective 2014 expenditure and 2015 first half expenditure and Norwegian tax receivable of $77 million.</p>
<p>The right hand chart there, splits out the capital spend on the two key development projects. These numbers are both quoted net of the carries we expect to receive from our partners in both cases from Dyas in the case of Catcher and EnQuest in the case of Kraken.</p>
<p>One point to note on the guidance here reconciling again to the prelims, at the prelims we guided at Catcher CapEx to kind of $145 million, that's moved to $180 million doesn’t reflect any change in the underlying CapEx estimates. It's just that part of the Dyas fund and their settle those cash rugs and carry. So the outstanding carry is slightly reduced because we have cash on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>In terms of the specific phasing of these CapEx forecasts, we anticipate $125 million in the second half of 2015 in respect of the Kraken development and on Catcher, we'll be fully carried for the balance of this year and into 2016.</p>
<p>On the Exploration Appraisal Program it was a little bit more difficult to give firm guidance on the phasing of that, but broadly speaking for the three wells in Senegal that represent the bulk of that it will be one in Q4 and two in 2016 is our expectation.</p>
<p>So on to Slide 8 to sum up from a financing strategy and a funding position point of view, we're fully funded to deliver our planned Exploration Appraisal and Development programs. These will take us through key evaluation events in the portfolio. Appraisal of the Senegal resource base, cash flow from the U.K. development projects as well as selective ongoing early stage exploration portfolio building.</p>
<p>We have purposefully and carefully preserved balance sheet strength and took early action last year to reduce our cost base and as a result we're well positioned for the current lower oil price environment even if it continues for some time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we've actively managed our portfolio to ensure we're only investing capital in projects with no oil price breakeven economics and that is true for our North Sea assets which delivered healthy returns to Cairn even at the current quarter.</p>
<p>It is particularly true for Senegal where it started breakeven oil price with development sanction to be sub $40 a barrel and where we're obviously taking full advantage of the lower industry cost environment that we are currently enjoying and it will continue to be true as we shape the business going forward, both looking at new opportunities and following on from success in Senegal and elsewhere.</p>
<p>And with that, I'll hand over to Richard to talk about the forthcoming operational program in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Richard Heaton</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, James. Thank you, Simon. And let’s move now to slide 10, the 2015 Senegal program which is going to be a pretty exciting one. And most of my talk will focus on Senegal and then towards the end some update on our UK and Norway activity.</p>
<p>So in Senegal we operate a large lot come on behalf of the joint venture partners, together with Petrosen, ConocoPhillips and FAA. It’s a large acreage position here. And last year as you know we made two basin opening, discovery is very important both FAN-1 and SNE-1.</p>
<p>Since that time we've been very busy working. We've submitted an extensive evaluation program to the government in May this year and we've have the agreement of the government subsequently to that program and that is what is going to kick-off very shortly.</p>
<p>Starting with an extensive 3D seismic acquisition program over the eastern part of our Sangomar block and in southwestern corner of Rufisque and that will add to the program of 3D opportunity we've had for - since we've been in the block with very high quality 3D over the discoveries we've made so far.</p>
<p>As our capital markets stated early, this year we submitted a significant amount of technical information about what we're doing there and everything I am going to say today is going to be consistent with that with some further details on actually what the evaluation program over SNE is going to be.</p>
<p>Essentially that’s one of the largest discoveries, and of the largest discovery we made in oil last year. This is a very good place to be. We will start the program with seismic, as I said probably in September and the rig - the Ocean Rig Athena will begin its activity slightly later than that.</p>
<p>We move now to slide 11, and talks about the full block potential. Then we've got a very good position with both distribute resources, some prospects that are identified on the existing 3D and a position with leads from 2D seismic data which will be converted to 3D with the new program.</p>
<p>And if you add those three together then that’s a potential gross mean risked resource potential for the block of something around a $1 billion barrels or more which is a great position to be.</p>
<p>The additional factories that many of these are sufficiently close together, the one discovery and one hub development and liking a series of other prospects and leads when they come to discoveries as we hope they will.</p>
<p>We have great source for Rufisque. We have great reservoirs in the shelf area. We've got ability with high quality 3D to unlock the potential right across this license. We have a very good long colorless hydrocarbons in the FAN discovery, the first discovery, but the reservoir quality there was - those less net reservoir, but in the SNE discovery than we had good reservoir quality and quite clean context. And I'll go through that on the next slide.</p>
<p>So slide 12 sums up the SNE discovery. We have 32 API sweet crude with a gas cathode with that, a 100 meters of gross gas gross oil and a 100 meters of gross oil column with good quality reservoirs there with high porosity.</p>
<p>We've got very clearly defined context between the gas and the oil and the oil in the water and that is very unusual to be able to collect that all in one well. We are quite fortunate in that perspective. And the structural track here ties down where we believe many of the boundaries on the discovery are.</p>
<p>Having said that, it is an extensive discovery as I'll come on to demonstrate and the large aerial extent means it’s an extensive appraisal program we're about to embark on.</p>
<p>We move to the next slide, this is the first of the appraisal wells. This is a map showing where the SNE-1 Discovery well was. The red line represents the gas oil contact and the green line, the oil water contact one of the reservoir levels. You can see that we incepted gas over oil in the SNE-1 well on this map.</p>
<p>The first appraisal location will be very much in the center of the field where we expect the maximum height of closure of this structural trap. So this should give us the maximum gas to maximum oil column through the reservoirs.</p>
<p>The importance here is that we've allowed us to gather the most information about all the reservoirs and we’ll have an extensive coring program here of at least three cores. We will have an extensive logging program which will allow us to characterize those rocks and match them against the logs and the cores and we will then have an extensive testing program at the end of the well to test both the reservoirs at the base which are more blocky sands and also the reservoirs hire up potentially where they're more heterolithic and embedded.</p>
<p>The importance is that we've got a very high data gathering content. It’s very frontend loaded in this program we ensure that as we go on through the development that we've got the information that we need. So the second well will be SNE-3 and if you turn to the next page that shows where that’s located, it’s in the south of the field at this level in the level in the map.</p>
<p>And here we will intercept the other part of the reservoir within the oil column and we will have an extensive coring program here again probably three or more cores and subsequently if we hit the right kind of reservoir quality that we'll be testing here of the oil within the thinner reservoirs and the upper part of the field.</p>
<p>Together these two -- first two wells clearly going to cover a significant increase in data in the field and the importance of gathering all this information early on is that it will give us the confidence both in the shape of the field in terms of its overall size. You can see that line, the green line there probably over 100 square kilometers in area, it’s quite a significant field.</p>
<p>We move to the next slide, this is the third appraisal location and that is very much to the north of the field. Now this particular well I will come on to describe a little bit more later because actually this is an exploration well primarily to the Bellatrix prospect but we’ve now found that the Bellatrix prospect overlies the northern end of the SNE field on the latest 3D processing, which is very convenient.</p>
<p>So if you manage to get more banks for our buck in this particular well, this will define the northern end of the field. It allows to characterize the reservoirs there. We'll have an extensive logging program here, but at the moment there isn’t a firm coring program here or a firm testing program. Obviously results will depend a little bit on how the first two wells also goes, so we have some flexibility here.</p>
<p>The key is that this is a well that will be drilled together both exploration and development information.</p>
<p>We go back now to look the whole block situation. The program we have submitted to the Government not just looks at the SNE discovery, which is clearly the focus to make sure that we gather information there to confirm commerciality and to move us towards development, but we also have as talked earlier a very extensive list of prospects in the surrounding area particularly things like Bellatrix which I'll discuss in a moment is very closely positioned and can easily be developed within a hub.</p>
<p>But we have an extensive prospect inventory which is gross mean resource of about 380 barrels. It's already identified and a string of leads covered in yellow on this map which the 3D seismic we’re hoping some evolve will be converted to prospects too.</p>
<p>And the gross mean number there for those is probably around 330. So together with the 330 million barrels proven and probable in the SNE field that’s how we get to a block wide volume.</p>
<p>So there’s a lot’s of remapping going on at the moment. We have significantly de-risked a lot of the prospects and leads that we saw before we drilled. We always liked this acreage because it has multiple plays in it. We have tested two of the four plays in each of the two wells that we've drilled. There are additional plays that we’re starting to recognize here, perhaps as many as seven or eight in the licensed and hopefully our exploration program over the next while we’ll start to de-risk those.</p>
<p>And the first one now moving to the next slide is the Bellatrix prospect. This overlies SNE. It has shallower reservoirs, younger reservoirs. No wells have penetrated these reservoirs yet. It’s interesting and has seismic anomalies associated with it which is typical to see how those arise given the situation we're in here without them being quite likely to be oil and gas. So this is very interesting.</p>
<p>We’re overlying the oil and gas of the SNE field. So we expect to find oil and gas here. The question is what is the proportion just mentioned before this can be tied in to the SNE field when that gets developed.</p>
<p>We move on now to where we’re going to development on Slide 18. The whole point of the evaluation program is to confirm the volumes and show that those are both the level that we expect commerciality.</p>
<p>It will take us the information integrating the information between the cores, the extensive logs and the test data to give us an idea of how many wells it's going to take to produce this field and give us a good idea on the costs.</p>
<p>We have a 330 million barrel field and this depth of water by 1100 meters is a number of fields around the world including West Africa where development such as this has gone ahead. Most are FPSO production systems and so there’s a good deal of cost and technical data that can be used to benchmark the discoveries and developments in these kinds of fields.</p>
<p>We expect plateau rates to the field to be somewhere in 50,000 to 100,000 barrels a day just from SNE alone and obviously we can tie in other fields. It does take time to pull this together, so our evaluation plan takes them to a two to four year period is quite usual to enable such developments to proceed and probably a further three to five years before first oil and we’re well aligned with partners and government in trying to move that forward in that kind of time scope.</p>
<p>That completes the discussion on Senegal. Move briefly now a few slides on the U.K. and Norway. We’ve been very busy here. This is the other part of our balanced portfolio. The partners Premier in Catcher and EnQuest in Kraken fields, very busy with the developments and both those companies reporting later this week.</p>
<p>So much of the detail here will be given in over the next few days, but essentially the Catcher project remains on budget scheduled first oil in 2017. We started the drilling of the top holes in the reservoirs July this year. So the rigs are on contracts and working well.</p>
<p>The fabrication of the FPSO holding top size ongoing on the Far East and also we have started work also in the North Sea installing some of the subsea equipment as shown on the pictures here. So this is a major project for us. It’s certainly a major project for Premier and obviously heading towards targets oil and on 2017.</p>
<p>In Kraken also in the North Sea operated by EnQuest, the game remains on target, on budget and again we have began drilling this year, this summer. That's going well. The top holes have been completed in the first two drill centers and we've begun drilling the first through the reservoir there. That's all going on target as well and hopefully get more detail from EnQuest on their results presentation tomorrow.</p>
<p>In addition on the final slide of my presentation through the developments we also have of course built a considerable exploration position in the U.K. and Norway, mostly around discoveries and development projects.</p>
<p>We're also looking to expand that position. We have been awarded further licenses earlier this year in the Norwegian rounds. We will be looking to potentially put some further applications forwards in the API round and 23rd Round where we've been looking some of the barren area this year.</p>
<p>So that's an interesting building position there. It does represent the other side of our portfolio to the West African position and addition to these of course as Simon has mentioned, we do continue to look at the whole range of new venture and new business opportunities to continue our balance portfolio.</p>
<p>With that I will hand back to Simon.</p>
<p><strong>Simon Thomson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Richard.</p>
<p>Just moving on to the final slide; In closing Cairn therefore remains fully funded to deliver all of its strategic objectives through to the commencement of sustainable cash flow in 2017.</p>
<p>We continue to focus on a balanced portfolio and that's with an appropriate allocation of capital and equity exposure to assets with attractive commercial terms. We believe that provides the best platform for sustainable value growth.</p>
<p>We also as Richard mentioned, continue to actively assess new ventures within the context of that balanced offering. So that's both as regards additions to our pipeline of exploration opportunities and also cash flow generating assets in the current oil price environment potentially provides additional opportunities in this respect.</p>
<p>And as you can tell we're very excited about the upcoming program in Senegal that we believe can add significant value for shareholders by confirming the commerciality of the SNE-1 Discovery and also proving up additional resource on the acreage.</p>
<p>Thank you, that concludes the presentation and I would now like to hand back to the operator for questions.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your first question today comes from Alex Topouzoglou from Exane BNP Paribas. Please go ahead Alex.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Topouzoglou</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, guys and thanks for taking my questions. On Senegal we've seen ConocoPhillips take a set back from exploration from international and deep water exploration and they cancelled the Ensco Drillship.</p>
<p>So clearly the follow-up campaign will be dependent on the results of the three firm wells, but in the meantime have you noticed any change in attitude from your partners over a follow-up campaign in Senegal?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>No sorry as George said. The answer is no absolutely not. We had and I think close communication with Conoco throughout the team levels right out to the highest levels of the organization and there is absolute commitment to this project and to proving up the value in Senegal.</p>
<p>I think so not just for us and for far, but also for Conoco, this represents a material value opportunity. So we're all pushing forward together on this.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Topouzoglou</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks. On India if you could give us a little extra color on your views on the photos of Cairn India Vedanta Merger? Potentially were you interested in having a stake in the diversified resources company or comfortable sharing with Vedanta and their burden so on?\</p>
<p>And then also if you could provide us with an update on the timelines and so on with regard to India arbitration please, thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So maybe I will just answer the first part of your question and hand over to James. Look the answer is it's premature for us to comment. Obviously as we've said we'll look at this proposed merger with a view to voting in a way that's in the best interest of our shareholders.</p>
<p>The circular hasn’t yet been issued and voting doesn’t happen until the end of the year, but rest assured we will be looking from our perspective, is this in the best interest of our shareholders when we do come to vote. With that I'll hand over to James on the arbitration.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. On the arbitration which we launched, well under the treaty we launched a notice of dispute in March, which basically initiated the process and as we mentioned at that time there is a period under the treaty for good faith negotiations to try and reach a settlement and that’s what we've been doing with the government or to try and reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Over recent months, you will have seen recently that we have moved to appoint our arbitration panel member now. So the Wetworks is that each party to us in the Government of India appoints who an arbitration member panel, members of the panel and then those two between them appoint the Chairmen and so we've kicked off that process by appointing ours and advising India to do the same.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Topouzoglou</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question today comes from Stephane Foucaud from FirstEnergy Capital. Please go ahead Stephane.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stephane Foucaud</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, guys. I have two questions, the first is more around balance sheet response change, what are the recent movements in oil price and part the latest RBI and the bank, how much you think you can draw on the RBI given you have the time contacts and given the movement on the forward curve?</p>
<p>And second question what sort of bend price assumption do you use internally with your acquisition or approximately Kraken and Catcher understand you get a low breakeven price that parts I’m sure using a higher oil price for in the decision. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks for those. On the first one in terms of the bank facility, as I mentioned in the presentation in the same position as we went back in March which is we expect to draw up to $300 million from that facility.</p>
<p>At Inception back in 2014 the anticipation was that we would draw up to $400 million with the balance of $175 available as that is a credit and so on. That $400 million is reduced to $300 million as a result of two things.</p>
<p>One is the found down of Catcher. So obviously there is a level of resource base underlying facility now because we produce their stake and the other is obviously a reduction in the bank's forecast oil price as they use for projecting cash flows.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stephane Foucaud</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you and on brent price assumption.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I think in the current environment as you say, the focus for us is very much on breakeven prices. So we have planning cases in line with many of peers that anticipate after a period in line with the forward curve a recovery of the oil price and that remains a practice for impairment testing and longer term planning that ultimately when we're looking at every project now it's all about the breakeven price and we would look for something around $50 month there and as I said in terms of where we're exploring and appraising it's lower than that. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stephane Foucaud</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question today comes from Anish Kapadia from TPH. Please go ahead Anish.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anish Kapadia</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I have been three questions please, just firstly on Catcher, one of your partners have been some issues in terms of the FPSO and just in the first production delay from the middle of 2017 so towards the end with that and maybe somewhat already.</p>
<p>Just wondering if you get run through some of the issues that again with the FPSO over there and how confident you are on that end of 2017 so after that will have problems with the center projects and today.</p>
<p>And second question is looking forward to 2018 as there you got Catcher and Kraken on stream, just wondering if you could give some idea of free cash flow if you expect from Catcher and Kraken in 2018 and inside $50 oil price.</p>
<p>And finally wondering if you can just give some update on what's happening on Shelter. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so I’ll answer the first bit on your comment on [mo] [ph], we saw that commentary and it relates to the -- the fabrication of the FPSO and there have been some issues I am sure that the you will last at the operator and they’ll confirm, but the operator has put in very significant actions to safeguard the sell away date. So from our perspective, and obviously we've been in conversations with the operator on this and communication that the project remains on track and on budget.</p>
<p>So they've taken mitigating actions to ensure that it doesn’t result in any delay, but I think you next question was…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>On free cash flow, yes. I think we tend not to give cash flow projections, but I guess there was a relatively simple calculation. So if we're producing a peak 22,500 barrels a day, which would be roughly where we are in 2018 the all in OpEx cost if you get own lease cost and so on across the two projects weighted average to us is $34 a barrel.</p>
<p>So if you take that production level multiply it by your oil price assumption and take off that OpEx, it will give you a good idea of what cash flow. There is no tax to be paid in the first several years of production because obviously we've generated a significant amount of shelter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And the final question I think was on Scafell. There is an area development planning process going on there because Scafell is just one of a number of discoveries made in the region none of which on its own is optimally going to lead to a standalone development, but together they can.</p>
<p>That process is in its relatively early stages, but will move probably towards a concept select position sometime during 2016 is the expectation at the moment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anish Kapadia</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question today comes from Nathan Piper from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead Nathan. The next question today comes from Dan Ekstein from UBS. Please go ahead Dan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Ekstein</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And good morning, everyone. Couple of questions on the appraisal program in Senegal. In terms of the coring and the testing, what would it represent sort of a 350 result for you on the coring in terms of the sands ability velocity and hydrocarbon saturation?</p>
<p>And then on the testing, what's your base case in terms of where rates and/or the eye on that? And then a second question also on the appraisal program, are any of the three contingent wells for next year are going to have anything to do with the sand discovery?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Let me take the last question first. We have a number of scenarios as you can imagine with such an extensive area on many different prospects, leads and indeed two discoveries. So there are quite a number of options available to us for the second set of wells if you think of it that way.</p>
<p>We haven't reached a final decision yet. Clearly there is work ongoing still in terms of reprocessing of the seismic data and inversion, which is focusing on the deeper water fans place and there are multiple reservoir levels as we penetrated within the fan well.</p>
<p>There are also prospects to the side of that, that they intersect similar reservoir levels but also different ones and we need to look at the whole of that tougher and tie that in with the later seismic data look at what we think of the volumes and the rest associated in order to make sure that we can place it well in the most optimum position to test that sort of play again to appraise that.</p>
<p>So no decision is being made firmly on that. Yet of course it is one of the considerations that is within the plan, but there isn’t a fixed set of wells that we're looking at that are rather large number of them at the moment, but we'll make sure we choose the optimum ones for those.</p>
<p>Looking at the actual price of program in terms of the coring, the idea will be to gather as much information about the various different reservoir levels as we can and of course it’s critical together that coring information we will give ourselves multiple chances by focusing on the first wells first.</p>
<p>So if we get very, very good results and the first two wells then potentially so long as the result in the third well for instance is largely along with predictions that we may not need to gather any of that.</p>
<p>But it will depend if we get less than a certain amount than obviously that will mean that we would want to try and core in subsequent wells as well. Until we actually see the results and exactly what that means, it would be real hard to give a particular precise number of how much we need that really is down to.</p>
<p>But we have a view of what represents a good result here. We know that the advantage of having a lot of core to begin with really helps with making sure that you optimize that number of wells and the sort of wells in any future development.</p>
<p>Similarly for the test results, we have different sorts of reservoirs there. So we anticipate different kinds of results coming out of those different reservoirs that connectivity as well as their productivity is important, it will take more than these three wells to answer all of those questions.</p>
<p>As pointed out I think in the slides, in the third well we intend to [audio gap] in the programs one of the possible contingent wells in order to [audio gap] there is large range of possible scenarios there. The core data and the logs and [audio gap]…</p>
<p>Yeah, about how to conduct the next set of wells to actually get hard numbers at the moment on what we expect from those would probably not be helpful. I think that we’ve said that the first well had 24% frosty the main oil sands there. If it remains at that level, that’s excellent reservoir quality. The productivity will come from the testing.</p>

<p>The next question today comes from David Mirzai from Societe Generale. Please go ahead, David.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Mirzai</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good morning. Couple of quick questions for me. First on potential full consolidation in the industry, you did point towards cash flow generation of assets having potential to add to the business model especially with your tax losses in U.K. and production two Tiers away.</p>
<p>What kind of market are you seeing in U.K. assets and how has that evolved from six months to 12 months ago when the deal could have been done and just secondly, in terms again of the senate lease development, you've obviously benchmarked across a wide range of projects and also in terms of years mentioned, again how have you seen the cost profile for new project evolve over those years in the projects you’ve been benchmarking to.</p>
<p>And what types of eventuality do you see for your own project? Do you think that rig cost can go lower? Are you still waiting to see some cost come down in the Subsea or things like FPSO from the yard? What have you seen in your benchmarking compared to what you’re seeing in today’s market thanks?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>I think and James had answered the second part. I think in relation to the first part of your question, first of all just to clarify in relation to cash flow generating opportunity from our perspective, it’s not necessarily limited to the North Sea and in terms of our assessment from a new venture basis it's something that at the end of the day would be attractive to us from a value perspective wherever it's situated.</p>
<p>Obviously you point out there are some synergies for us in relation to our current position in the North Sea, tax losses and so on. In the North Sea particularly, it's interesting, it remains a pretty active market. I would say it remains actually pretty competitive in relation to those assets that industry and private equity view as attractive from the point of view of returns.</p>
<p>Quite often that's in relation to front end either production is about to come on newly commissioned production opportunities and obviously as you will know, there are some packages that which perhaps involve later like assets which maybe arguably in the same way.</p>
<p>So I think it still remains notwithstanding the current price impact of lower prices, it still remains a very competitive market and the trick is to access in one way or another or whether it's fully distressed situations or otherwise the particular asset without attached liabilities but can provide us what we need and I think we've always said that we would like to smooth out cash flow profile and bring forward some cash flow.</p>
<p>So yes, we continue to actively access that as the market remains active and the market for the right kind of asset remains pretty competitive, James, do you want to…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, in terms of well I suppose today obviously it feels like a good time to be drilling a appraisal drilling in Senegal, the cost of doing so compared to exploration wells have significantly reduced.</p>
<p>I think in terms of the broader cost environment, thinking about taking it right through the development phase, it was a difficult one with long term planning because it's partly relative to what your long term oil price planning case is and we tend to run a number of scenarios.</p>
<p>I think if we were planning it as of today, then the cost environment would be at least 30% below where it was last year and that's a combination of deep water drilling having fallen by 40% or 50% in terms of rig costs and other service costs having fallen by at least 20%, so on balance around about a third.</p>
<p>That said we run a number of scenarios. We run as we said back in the Capital Markets Day, if you assume a recovery to long term $90 oil price and the cost environment doesn’t existed in the middle of last year before prices started to fall, then we pointed to an unlevered IRR for the project of 35%.</p>
<p>But equally if you run on the other end of the prima of long term $50 oil price case and a modest cost reduction of say 20%, then we're still in the 20s in terms of IRRs and clearly cost have fallen more than 20%. They've fallen by 30% or 40% or you know what, 30% or perhaps more if the oil price stays at $50 or below and that would project IRR back up into the high 20% or 30%.</p>
<p>So actually the relative fall in cost to oil prices keep our project IRRs in the same relatively narrow bracket, but both have been very volatile. So it's a challenging one.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Mirzai</span></strong></p>
<p>No certainly and I mentioned given the cost reductions you've already outlined, if we were to have a hick up the lower or longer $50 a barrel environment, you would expect some things which or some areas which have been sheltered so far to also have to come down in cost and I am thinking specifically you haven't seen a lot of the kind of the FP so cost reduction in the market as people are currently finishing off their oil contracts, but certainly that will be something you could optimize better.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes as you say, there is longer term contracts and construction projects, obviously there is a longer lag on those, but certainly if we're thinking about project sanctions in 2018 or beyond and the oil prices remain lower for that much longer then we're definitely have been expecting to see the impact.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Mirzai</span></strong></p>

<p>The next question today is from Sanjeev Bahl from Numis Securities. Please go ahead Sanjeev.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sanjeev Bahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning and thanks for taking my questions. I've got two question potentially just wanted just if you could quantify the current U.K. tax loss position, you actually did that announcement today.</p>
<p>And secondly, on tax spending your current Q3 resource space through a converged blend, I was wondering if you could split that between the deeper block you found on the higher embedded sense that would be pretty useful.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. I'll let Richie go first on the SNE question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Heaton</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi Sanjeev, essentially we haven't given a figure out on how those are sub divided. Clearly there is a number of ways that you can calculate the resource range within the field.</p>
<p>We’ve had a number of people look about independently as well as ourselves and effectively the ranges that we have given from a once 150 or so all the way through the three figure of 670. That is kind of replicated virtually irrespective of how you kind do the figures.</p>
<p>Obviously we’ve made some more sophisticated models now and we’re looking to back up those models with the well results where you can start to run some dynamic modeling on productivity.</p>
<p>Those obviously fall within the ranges as well, but until such time as we've got more data to actually formally changes or release new figures would not be the most prudent thing at the moment. We’re comfortable really with the range that we have. We think that captures both variability in the lower reservoir proportion and the upper reservoir proportions quite reasonably.</p>
<p>Probably the biggest factor affecting us is really just the ultimate shape of the envelopes of the gross rock volume is the first thing that we’re aiming to reduce the uncertainties of with these wells and of course secondly being the actual reservoir qualities themselves across what is quite a large area.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sanjeev Bahl</span></strong></p>
<p>And tax loss returns?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, on the tax losses the accounting treatment of pretending tax losses is all that complicated because you have to allocate across the portfolio. So I sympathize with it being difficult to extract.</p>
<p>But the straightforward number is that we have North Sea losses of $470 million. So there is corporate losses if you like that they're being through acquisition and spend and in addition to that, over the life the fields we'll build up capital allowances of £490 million across Catcher and Kraken. So that relates to the small field and heavy oilfield allowances.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sanjeev Bahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question today comes from Rafal Gutaj from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rafal Gutaj</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes thanks. Good morning, everyone. So two questions for me please. First James could you give us a bit more a defined breakdown of both 170 million E&amp;A spend between the second half of this year and the first half of 2016?</p>
<p>And then moving on from that, likely could you provide a few moving parts, but some more defined savings up to $650 million, you think about in Catcher and Kraken based on your discussions with Partners.</p>
<p>And then secondly Richard just on your expectation of the exploration element to Bellatrix, can you give us a breakdown of what you think in terms of new cost and what are the primary risk there? Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes so in terms of the phasing of sand, I would say I would give you some indication, I would say it's a preliminary indications because obviously phasing -- operational phasing does tend to move around a bit after still incurring of CapEx for accounting reasons.</p>
<p>So of the 170, 130 at Senegal and the seismic will be a rest of a small portion that is seismic which will be acquired this year and then basically we expect it to be one well in Q4 and two wells in the first half of next year.</p>
<p>So just roughly speaking one third, two third split is probably reasonable for that 130 and then the balance of the other 40 is probably roughly a half, half split between the second half of this year and 2016.</p>
<p>Sorry not to be more specific. The guidance for the committed forward program because activity particularly in non-operated licenses does move around through the budgeting cycle, but that will be a fair indication.</p>
<p>And in terms of the development capital, we haven’t given year-by-year phasing, but of the -- so I've said Kraken we expect to be 125 for the second half of this year. I would say the remainder of that is roughly evenly split over '16 and '17.</p>
<p>And then on Catcher will be carried through this year and well into next year. So the Catcher numbers will be over the say second half of '16 and '17.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rafal Gutaj</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Really helpful. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Heaton</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and just moving there onto the Bellatrix prospect, I’m not sure I caught all of your questions, but I think in terms of risking on the prospect nobody has drilled through these particular reservoir levels as yet.</p>
<p>You can see a little bit from the pictures on the presentation that in fact this is an erosion remnant. It’s being called before a buried hill. Essentially there isn’t any knowledge of what these reservoirs are absolutely like and that probably is the largest risk here.</p>
<p>We do have seismic anomalies in them which are quite difficult to explain and of course they do sit directly above the SNE field. So reservoir quality and what does that mean for how that might produce there are hydrocarbons in those probably the largest risk.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rafal Gutaj</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And do you have the cost under in mind on that -- geological in terms of success for your both exterior…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we've said that the chance of success is about 80%. Previously I think if you looked at the Capital Markets Day Presentation, that’s in that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rafal Gutaj</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question today comes from Jamie Maddock from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead Jamie.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jamie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, morning everybody. How many wells do you think you’ll need to drill to get to the bigger ability to design SNE in commercial discovery and in terms and just I guess to what level are you willing to run your cash or your net cash assume you're drilling RBL down to.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Jamie. We haven’t yet come with a final figure of how many wells it’s likely to be. Obviously our interest is in making sure by front loading appraisal program to reduce that to the furious number of wells that we have.</p>
<p>However, as you will probably appreciate, the number will actually depend upon the results of the wells themselves. So that it’s quite a complex and an unknown problem. It will be more than the three penetrations that we have placed in the firm wells as you can see. We’re fortunate that the Bellatrix exploration well can also reach an SNE appraisal location all within one vertical hole. So that’s a bit of a gain for us.</p>
<p>So it is really all about efficiency of appraisal. The result is clearly, the better the results that we get both from the reservoir quality from the ties of the call to the logs if that becomes quite simple. If the productivity from the test results is positive then it will need less appraisal wells.</p>
<p>And the more complicated and variable the results that we get out than more, but it would be again probably its prudent to give a specific number at the moment only that we will be very focused as the partnership is bound to be on making sure that, that is the fewest possible to get us first of all over a commercially viable number.</p>
<p>And then to make sure that we believe the most efficient development scheme can be put in place. Obviously it is a pretty large field. So getting the number of wells right is a factor that will play heavily on what the cost of development will be.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jamie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then on the -- to the extent I guess the way you had grown your net cash position down to or so if you take into consideration that you have accessible to assuming I guess we’re looking to the point to where you have first production to the North Sea in 2017 and the liquidity you want to obtain on the balance sheet?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah well I think that there are a number of checks to that Jamie. One is obviously with the debt facility, our lenders are very keen to as you would imagine ensure that the business is sufficiently funded each delivering free cash flow and they run also to sensitivities in a lower oil price environment and assuming operational delays and so on to ensure that we continue to be so.</p>
<p>So that’s a healthy check in its own right, but obviously as a Management Team and Board we have a policy of maintaining the number of tests we applied, but percentages of expenditure outstanding in minimum buffer thresholds to keep us funded free to delivering free cash flow from the project under all reasonable scenarios and that's what we will do.</p>
<p>But as you can see from simply adding up the sources of funding available to us now and the committed capital program there is some headroom to follow on from success and that’s all we have.</p>

<p>The next question today comes from Nathan Piper from RBC Capital Markets. Please go ahead Nathan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Piper</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. I think I fumbled my first chance, so sorry again here. There are two questions, first of all on India again I know you've given an update on the near term plans, but if Indian Government doesn’t want to in good phase come to an agreement, how long could that arbitration process take to actually come to a conclusion?</p>
<p>And then secondly, have you completed the pre stock migration on the SNE discover and if you have, have you find out the structures that go are flatter and therefore larger than you had previously indicated?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>On the first one Nathan, yes, I think obviously we’ve launched a tricky claim and that has timelines attached to it in terms of timelines for appointment of an arbitrator on behalf of the Indian Government in the event that they don't move forward with an appointment themselves.</p>
<p>As to how long will an arbitration take, it’s difficult to give guidance. I think we’ve indicated previously that looking at a full arbitration process could be a minimum of round about 18 months. It could be slightly longer than that. It just depends how quickly you can move forward with your submissions and so on. Obviously from our perspective as you might imagine, we are ready to go with all of that but Rich do you want to…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Heaton</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, hi Nathan that the PSTM processing is we’ve never quite completed this, but it's certainly led us to have the much firmer idea of what the shape of the field is likely to be. It’s played a part obviously in helping us locate these wells such that we can make sure that we get the most information out of them.</p>
<p>Overall it probably has broadened and flattened the structure as we imagined it would until such time as we complete the final processing that we haven’t completely rerun numbers on that. It will have some impact probably still the middle level probably falls still within the range that the 2C level is quite similar to where we are at the moment in most models. So we haven’t completely updated things as yet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Piper</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks and just back on arbitration side, I know it's in good faith and anything else, but number of oil and gas space the Indian Government has proven to be slower rather than faster. So I guess how do you sense your chances of completing this quicker versus as long as possible which has historically been the Indian approach to other disputes in the oil and gas space?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Nathan it’s difficult to sort of second guess what the government is going to do obviously. I think as we previously indicated, there is three broad avenues that we’ve been pursuing. One is the direct engagement to try and get an early resolution. The second is obviously the arbitration proceedings, which have been launched and the third is an appeal to the tax office directly which is also ongoing.</p>
<p>I think from our perspective, we've been through the process of arbitrations before in India and achieved resolution on those. So we are prepared for that if we need to go down the arbitration route.</p>
<p>The chances of any other solution will depend on the Indian Government reverting to us. And as I mentioned we are awaiting their feedback on the arbitration in particular from the Inter Ministerial Group, which we understand is going to be meeting anytime soon.</p>
<p>So it’s difficult to give you a particular data. As I said we’re moving as fast as we can. We think clarity in the solution whichever routes it gives us solution will be the best interest of all parties not just us. We will continue to push that.</p>

<p><strong><span class="question">James Hosie</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you and good morning, guys. A couple of questions for me just firstly on your resource base landing facility, can you comment about withdrawing down up to $200 million as that being the currently under the RBL?</p>
<p>And can you just remind us when the next to determine -- will be the termination of the facility to Kraken and then just in your North Sea development you mentioned 28 team for that peak net production rate for 22,500 barrels, how long do you expect to stay at that rate? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right. That’s kind of expectation of what we will draw and that reflects the oil price having being reduced by the banks. The oil price projections have been reduced by the banks over the last re determination. The next one will be at the end of September.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Heaton</span></strong></p>
<p>And then moving on to the fields -- so a couple of years I think is probably expected range of the peak. Obviously it will depend little bit on exact phasing of how things build up and when each of the fields preciously comes on as to have the shape of the curves going to be?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Hosie</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and that sounds like a couple of years that's based on the currently booked reserves not assuming any additions to it.</p>

<p>The next question today comes from the Ritesh Gaggar from GPM. Please go ahead Ritesh.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ritesh Gaggar</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. Last year your drilling in Senegal has rig issue which resulted in basically lot of CapEx overruns. Can you please provide whether you have embedded any contingency or what level, contingency bid in your guidance for the upcoming campaign?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I'll let James just talk about numbers but just to preface that obviously a selection of a rig in relation to this campaign one for drawn a wide pool because of the amount rig availability that there is at the minute has resulted in the downtown, that's one of the advantages that we talked about.</p>
<p>But two it's very important for us to select a rig that has been very active recently. This is a rig the usual rig of seventh generation dual activity that has been drilling in Angola on behalf of the Conoco partnership.</p>
<p>So from our perspective, we’re very focused on the uptime records of that rig, which are extremely good and we’re also extremely impressed by the way it’s been operated. So that’s the preface that we've been very focused on ensuring that we get the best possible operating equipment for this campaign, James you want to give the numbers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>One other point to make is that the particular charges we had last year were on the FAN well, the first well, which is in the deeper water. The well the SNE well we drilled in the shelf was actually within budget and I think slightly as we projected drilling time and that's obviously where the activity is focused over the next six to nine months.</p>
<p>So we have more comfort and obviously these are appraisal wells, so we have more going into. So we have more comfort in terms of the timing of the wells than we did it in the expiration phase obviously, but yes that 130 number includes a reasonable contingency estimate.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ritesh Gaggar</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. Thank you. Just one question regarding the three contingent well that might be in your calendar in 2016. Where should we be expecting a update on that? In terms of you and your partners would rather wait for the first appraisal well results from SNE 2 before committing for three more wells or we could hear sooner in September when your meetings held for different parts you drill?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>I think we will start planning that process in Q4 of this year. You’re right, there will be some interlinking in terms of the well results of course in terms of continued program, but we’re going to be leasing the partners from Q4 onwards.</p>
<p>And the other important point is that this isn’t three contingent options, all three wells together. It’s a one plus one plus one in the program to give us as much flexibility as possible in that regard.</p>

<p>Your next question today comes from James Thompson from JPMorgan. Please go ahead James.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi good morning gents. Just a couple of quick questions on Senegal, three firm wells in 3D seismic so all of the commitments you have under the terms of this evaluation plan you submitted to the or should we expect further commitment to come '16, '17, '18?</p>
<p>And secondly on the SNE appraisal well that is going to be a plugged and abandoned or are you going to be able to keep those for reentry related to either is future produce or potentially or just to monitor any future testing you do.</p>
<p>And just away from Senegal I would prefer to think in calendar year, could you give us any insight into what that H2 '16 E&amp;A capital budget looks like at the moment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Well Richie, do you want to cover first on Senegal.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Heaton</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah on Senegal I think the -- that can you just repeat that the first of your question. Yes it was in relation to the evaluation program whether three -- whether the commitment. The answer to that is actually what the governments are agreeing to is a full evaluation program and that’s what the joint venture are committing to.</p>
<p>But the commitment in terms of firm is just that. So it’s the three firm wells and the 3d seismic. We’ll then take a view as a joint venture including the government as Petrosen as to what is the best program of wells going beyond that but the commitment is these first three wells and 3D seismic.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So you've submitted an evaluation program you think it will be sufficient to get the first oil and that will be adjusted based on the results of these commitment wells?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>No it's Richard, no it's essentially it’s a step by step process, because obviously we’re frontend loaded the program to make sure that we gather as much as we can with the first ones. That will then inform first of all the one plus one plus one of the contingent wells that we have already identified as likely and we contracted the rig in order to do that.</p>
<p>But the plan that we submitted foresees a wider evaluation of the whole license obviously out a number of years in front and clearly dependent from the results of the seismic depend from the results of the first few wells and then the subsequent wells that has the ability to expand considerably.</p>
<p>And there is nothing committed other than the intent to make sure that we do the best technical evaluation of the whole license. That’s what it’s focused on and it’s focused on obviously making sure that acting stage that is agreed both with partners and the very importantly the government that that is the right thing to be doing. That’s what we’ve been encouraged to do as a partnership as well and that’s what we’ll follow through.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then on the sorry was -- do you have a follow-up on that question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p>Well just in terms of the appraisal wells you're drilling you’re going to be completed it produces or you’re going to pay on them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Heaton</span></strong></p>
<p>The likelihood is that we will be leaving gauges down in some of those wells to enable us to do subsequent interference testing. We will probably -- that will probably suspend them, but it’s actually it will depend upon how the development program is actually finalized whether they have any role in the future.</p>
<p>Most fields we find not because potentially you might want to put on the majority of wells as for instance horizontal or highly angled wells. But there’s no firm plan as to introduce these as producers at the moment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Heaton</span></strong></p>
<p>And on the rest of the E&amp;A program that 170 number represents the entire currently planned E&amp;A program, which roughly will be over the balance of this year and the first half of next year.</p>
<p>So there is nothing currently planned beyond that. I guess the only significant capital item and that’s not in that forecast is a signage point in island which might take place next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Fine so I guess you’re looking at less than $50 million in second half 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Well as I said, that 170 represents everything that's currently planned over this year and next year the only I suppose committed capital item on which phasing is uncertain beyond that is signage point, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Thompson</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question today comes from Brendan Warn from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead Brendon.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brendan Warn</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, good morning, gentlemen. Thanks again for a chance to ask some questions. it looks certain labor on about the appraisal program for Senegal, but if you shave the lack of other discoveries with a focus on in the E&amp;P sector, just coming back to your capital markets live pack which was quite comprehensive on Slide 29, I appreciate you might having a copy of it there with you.</p>
<p>But you sort of talked about six attributes, couple of which you are compartmental elevation and sort of clarify the appraisal wells you are drilling or you've committed to, just sort of what cash will be rich compartmental and slow assurance whether -- you also talked about the legal changing by the end of this year on Slide 38 and whether you're seeing a show up to that or you're committing to you 10-K or what are you thinking on even at the moment.</p>
<p>Can you just talk about the risk of the old water contract? Obviously you've only got one well in this discovery that is far, just what are the risks around not being certain where the old water contract is and certainly for the southern flank test.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Well I think the -- take the last point first, in the first as I said, in the presentation we were perhaps fortunate to intercept both contracts very, very clearly within reservoirs section. There is not always that your discovery well gets all that information to you.</p>
<p>And the crusher tests that we run the MDT test were very, very clear in identifying those contacts. That tends to suggest that the connectivity certainly within geological times is very good. We're using the seismic data both the pre-drilling and now the end data, tie in those to the seismic attributes that we see.</p>
<p>The extent that the appraisal wells will reconfirm that hopefully, we certainly have the contacts as being something that at the moment we're pretty confident likely to be field wide.</p>
<p>What they don't tell you of course is just how variable the reservoir is going to be what is really pretty extensive structure, but the seismic data does give us some indications that over that are at different levels and we have broken the reservoir into a number of levels for purposes of like capturing what the variability is going to be.</p>
<p>Again both the coring and the logging and the testing will all help us to calibrate that seismic data and use that as a model approach to make sure our reservoir models follow through and we can already be pretty sophisticated in breaking it into those different layers and characterizing the internal character within it, the seismic responses can be tuned to give us information, but actually tightening that to hard data, which really only is core and logs and tests together, that that's what we'll do.</p>
<p>The rig is already set up with tests -- high quality tests that's on it. Therefore it's reasonably efficient to be able to run test programs there and we will hopefully if things go to plan at the moment, be testing in the first well and that should be within this year if things go to schedule at the moment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brendan Warn</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just to clarify your opportunity to set up the flow technique for insurance what was sort of duration of the test runs you think you will be undertaking?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Well we've allowed at the moment in the first well that there will be a number of tests, but we're planning cases of up to about a month worth of testing in the first well. So it's a significant program. Of course that isn’t the interference testing, which will be the subject of potentially be the sort of the contingent wells further on.</p>
<p>We'll putting gauges in the first wells to enable that to continue through the second phase of the appraisal. So we'll to the single point product out this time and then depend upon those results. that will dictate as to where we should conduct the interference testing because obviously what the maximum benefit from that you can't really efficiently pre-engage that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brendan Warn</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The last question today comes from Charlie Sharp from Canaccord. You can go ahead Charlie.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charlie Sharp</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much and I am sure you're glad because I am the last question today.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Simon Thomson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charlie Sharp</span></strong></p>
<p>I am not in three parts just one question. I am sorry to get actually be that hard, I think you mentioned in one answer that the next redetermination of the end of September. If you were to use all the banks which you use, oil prices that we have today of about, what sort of shrinkage would you expect in the second part of the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Well as I mentioned we -- as a result of say the starting point -- let me put the facility in place in the middle of last year was and we expect to draw around $400 million to fund development CapEx in the North Sea with 175 designed as being the need for letters of credit during campaigns.</p>
<p>And so that $400 million in March this year reduced to around about $300 million, expected drawings over the development period as a result of a reduction in long-term oil price forecasts and the fact that we farmed out a interesting catch. So the reduction in the underlying reserve base in that facility and the reduction in the long term price deck.</p>
<p>And so we're now in a price deck that's in the kind of low to mid sort of low to mid 60s or low 60s traditionally and then mid 60s long term over our production period.</p>
<p>If that reduced further in line with where the forward curve is between today, then that $300 million would reduce a little bit more, but it wouldn't significantly impact our funding ability as we project for 2017 on the base case. We probably will have drawn that facility because the ideal thing to do, but in reality we rely on it relatively little to take us the development phase on this project given the cash on the balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charlie Sharp</span></strong></p>
<p>So just to be clear a redetermination to reduce the headline number would not affect your statement that you're fully funded?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Well I think reasonable scenarios as I said, we've already have a redetermination into the lower oil price environment with the banks if that were under oil reasonably pessimistic scenarios if that were to reduce further yet it doesn’t affect our statement.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charlie Sharp</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So even thought the oil price assumption that the dollar is below the I guess you said the mid 60s or around 60s, there should be no impact on funding?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">James Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>I guess what I would say is as you can imagine we particularly in this environment we have just I kind of speak to our bankers once over six months to see what their view is. It's a pretty ongoing dialogues and so based on that ongoing dialogue we're comfortable that the statement we're making today remains true and remains true under reasonable scenarios yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charlie Sharp</span></strong></p>
<p>That's what I wanted to get to. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Simon Thomson</strong></p>
<p>Okay. I think that's all the questions we've gone through. Thanks very much everybody for listening in and we look forward to coming back to you with updates on Senegal. So thanks a lot, bye.</p>
