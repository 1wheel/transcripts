<p><strong>Sam Anderson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, operator. Good morning everyone, and thank you for joining us today for our fiscal third quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I’m joined today by Brook Taube, our CEO; and Rick Allorto, our CFO.</p>

<p>I would now like to turn the call over to Brook.</p>
<p><strong>Brook Taube</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Sam. And welcome everyone to the call today. As a quick agenda, we’re going to give you an update on the net investment income and the dividend, our share repurchase program, the amendment and extension of the term loan and the revolving credit facility, quickly on the senior loan joint venture and our recently announced financing line for that effort, we’ll talk about the portfolio and investment activity in the quarter, an update on the SBIC, and then Rick as usual is going to give a brief overview of the financial results.</p>
<p>On Monday, we announced the financial results for the quarter ending June 30, net investment income per share was $0.30 and NAV per share was $11.53. On August 5th, the board approved a dividend of $0.30, that’s for the quarter ended 6/30 [ph] and that’s going to be payable on September 11, for our shareholders of record on August 19.</p>
<p>As we announced on the first quarter earnings call, the board had approved a $30 million share repurchase program. During this quarter, we purchased 169,000 shares, bringing the total repurchase since interception to just below 1 million shares. We intend to complete the remaining approximately $20 million of authorized repurchase over the next two quarters.</p>
<p>On July 28, we announced we had amended and extended both our revolver and the term loan facility that came with the reduction in pricing on the term loan and is a further reduction in pricing when we receive an investment grade rating for the company.</p>
<p>Last quarter, we announced the formation of the joint venture with Great American Life Insurance that created MCC Senior Loan Strategy Joint Venture. As we announced on August 5, the company raised $100 million credit facility that was agented by Credit Suisse. This facility is a seven year term and will support the ongoing investments of the joint venture. And as I’ve said in the past we expect this joint venture will add to net investment income overtime.</p>
<p>Turning now to the investment activity. We continue to see attractive opportunities and we remain active at Medley in the market through our various investment vehicles, however as I’ve said in the past while we are executing the share repurchase program we’re going to remain selective with respect to any new investments and during this quarter nearly all of the new investments were made either through our SBIC or in support of existing lending relationships.</p>
<p>During the quarter, we invested $47.5 million and we received the amortization and repayments of $49, this resulted in a very small increase in the overall portfolio size.</p>
<p>The portfolio, today consists of approximately 93% senior secured loans, it’s well diversified, the 71 borrowers across 21 industries. And as of June 30, non-accruals represented approximately 1% of the fair value of the portfolio.</p>
<p>In terms of exposure to the energy sector, that’s limited to four positions today and it represents approximately 6% of the portfolio. We said this in the past, if there’s -- repeating these are senior positions, they are first lien and they benefit from credit protections and include covenants, amortization and excess cash flow sweeps. Nevertheless, we do remain actively involved and in dialogue with all of these borrowers and continue to monitor all of these positions very closely.</p>
<p>On the SBIC at June 30, we had drawn a total of $130 million of the SBIC leverage. And at the time of this call, we’ve drawn down the remaining amount available under the $150 million. So our total facility is now drawn.</p>
<p>I’d like now to turn the call over to Rick for a brief financial update.</p>
<p><strong>Rick Allorto</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Brook. For the three months ended June 30, the company’s net investment income and net income were $17.2 million and $8.4 million or $0.30 per share and $0.14 per share respectively. The net asset value per share was $11.53 at June 30 compared to $11.68 at March 31.</p>
<p>For the quarter, total investment income was $36 million and was comprised of $33.8 million of interest income, $2.1 million of fee income and $0.1 million of dividend income.</p>
<p>Total operating expenses were $18.7 million, consisting of $9.9 million in base and incentive management fees, $6.2 million in interest and financing expenses, and $2.6 million in professional fees, administrator expenses and general and administrative expenses.</p>
<p>For the quarter, the company reported net unrealized appreciation of $427,000 and a net realized loss from investments of $9 million. As of June 30, the company’s total debt outstanding equaled $586.7 million, including $181.7 million outstanding on a revolving credit facility, $171.5 million term loan payable, $103.5 million in notes payable and $130 million of SBA debentures. The company’s debt to equity ratio excluding SBIC debt was 0.69 times.</p>
<p>In addition as Brook mentioned earlier in the call, the company’s credit facility agented by ING was amended following the end of the quarter. The company was able to reduce pricing, extend final maturity to 20/20 for both facilities and amend certain covenants and borrowing base definitions that provides flexibility and reduces balance sheet risk.</p>
<p>That concludes my financial review. I will now turn the call back over to Brook.</p>
<p><strong>Brook Taube</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Rick. And thank you all for your time today. We continue to implement the share repurchase program in the quarter and we intend to complete the full 30 million repurchase over the next two quarters. Importantly, we amended the current ING Credit facility which strengthens our balance sheet that’s why we added lending capacity through the Credit Suisse agency facility that’s associated with our senior loan joint venture and both of these financings demonstrate strong support from our lending partner group.</p>
<p>The team at Medley continues to grow, we are excited about the opportunities that we’re seeing in the market and we will continue to seek ways to enhance shareholder value at MCC.</p>
<p>We can now open the call for questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question will be from the line of Mickey Schleien, Ladenburg.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mickey Schleien</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Brook and Rick. Wanted to just ask quickly the realized loss was on Family Christian, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mickey Schleien</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, Brook can you walk us through the reasoning behind that exit as opposed to working it up through the bankruptcy process?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. This was a complex bankruptcy. As the quarter unfolded, we determined along with our lending partners in this deal that it was likely going to require substantially more capital in the follow on if we were going to pursue a credit bid effectively. And it was a uncertain outcome. So the opportunity we were faced was more capital with an uncertain outcome for and available recovery in cash and I think we along with the other lenders decided that with these few outcomes the assessment was that it had -- choose the latter and it was in the best interest to take the cash.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mickey Schleien</span></strong></p>
<p>I understand. So you had net unrealized appreciation of 3.4 but that must have been net of reversals of almost sort of 9 million for Family Christian, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>It is net of the reversal but not $5 million; it would have been net of just what the prior quarter mark was.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mickey Schleien</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, Rick can you just walk me through what were the major changes in unrealized appreciation or depreciation for the quarter, just highlights?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rick Allorto</span></strong></p>
<p>Family Christian is the major change, the balance of the portfolio by and large you know performed well and slight uptick with the majority of our market yield analysis calculations.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mickey Schleien</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And my last question, Brook I looked, I couldn’t find where the terms on the new Credit Suisse facility for the senior loan fund are listed. Can you give us any color on that and how much leverage you expect to use there and what sort of ROE you expect there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. As we said in prior periods our intention and we have available $100 million of equity capital balance between ourselves and our partner. This is the first $100 million so it would be the equivalent of one times debt-to-equity. We intend to expand that as time goes on and what we said previously that we expect it to use and this would be a target of upto two times leverage overtime to drive a mid teens return to our capital to give you an idea this is approximately seven year final and we’re going to intend to increase it. The terms of the facility are not public Mickey.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mickey Schleien</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. I appreciate your time this morning. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question will be from the line of Kyle Joseph, Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kyle Joseph</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, morning guys thanks for taking my questions. I just wanted to get your outlook for sort of the funded portfolio yield, looks like it’s stabilized in the quarter, but just in terms of your near term maturities yields versus deals you are seeing in your pipeline replacing those assets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. As we are seeing across the platform today I think there has been stabilization in all-in yields, I think some have said they have begun to see a pickup in opportunities in terms of target yields, some of the commentary we’re hearing is that with BDCs trading below book in capital constraint that that’s partly driving it. I think our view is that whether it’s Greece or macro or rate rising or oil there are a number of factors contributing to a risk off mentality, feels like it’s been the case each of the last several summers anyway.</p>
<p>So certainly the overall formation of capital in our specific sector is a component but its broader than that, those are driving the stability if not widening. I think from our perspective what’s more important is that we’re seeing opportunities to keep our structure and covenants, so we’re able to source opportunities that we would call on balance at or more senior and more of secure but for the first time in many quarters I think we are seeing an opportunity to stabilize this slight new wider yield opportunity and that’s across the board.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kyle Joseph</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. And then just with the new, with a credit facility for that joint venture, do you guys expect that to be a key focus for capital deployment and then just going back to the income statement where exactly ROE and see that income flow throughs imagine it’s a controlled company.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>So taking the second question first. The – on the income statement it will be a controlled company, it’s just that the joint venture itself is an equity interest and it will flow through that line item, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rick Allorto</span></strong></p>
<p>And Kyle, as a recap I think we’ve said this before, the two sources for us on the asset side are contribution of existing assets which we are looking at as well as new assets because of the broader platform and origination capabilities we have at Medley. We do have a pipeline of high quality opportunities of new opportunities we would expect in the next two quarters to begin to put assets into the facility as well begin to ramp the financing, but that you’ll see that begin to emerge in the next several quarters and then into 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kyle Joseph</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks for answering my questions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Kyle.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question will be from the line of Christopher Nolan, MLV and Company</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. Is there any plan to get a second SBIC license?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I think we had said this before. We do intend to pursue that, we’ll complete the investing of the existing one and we’ll be in dialogue with our good partners at the SBA to pursue the second license and we’re also looking forward to possible positive regulatory upside there and we’ll keep you posted in the quarters ahead on that progress.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so you sort of expect this to be a six month or nine month process do you think?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t think we can comment on the timing that we’ll do it as quickly as we can, but it’s likely to be a 2016 event if I had to put a target on it. I just don’t know when would be realistic during 2016 to expect to complete a process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Got you. On the SLS, you guys commented in terms of a mid-teens return and given that the current yields for the portfolio roughly 12.5% this is roughly 150 basis points to 200 basis points that incremental difference, is that a correct way to sort of looking at it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that’s right. It should be a on t he margin it will be accretive to NII if you use that framework.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>And then you know given that accretion to NII wouldn’t you know putting since your commitments to 87.5 million in capital, given what the share price is, wouldn’t it make more sense to actually rather doing the SLF to do more share repurchases with our capital?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>I think we’ve as we’ve said the past we have an intention of implementing the existing share repurchase and that remaining balance is $20 million. That’s going to take us the next several quarters and during that time we do intent to ramp the SLF. We do believe it’s accretive to earnings depending on where the stock is in 2016. We have not ruled out the idea that we would revisit share repurchases in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, the share repurchases you think right now will probably be completed within the next two quarters, and we can possibly re-up on the authorization beyond then?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>I said we’ll revisit based upon the market and the various factors which will include opportunities to originate stock price market dynamics. So, I don’t think we’re going to commit to that, but it certainly not off the table as we look into 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks for taking my questions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Chris.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question will be from the line of Jonathan Bock, Wells Fargo Securities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Bock</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Brook and guys; thank you for taking my questions. Starting first with the SLF and its intended ramp, and at times we see when -- and Brook, your commentary on deal flow was helpful. But let’s say that liquidity continues to just flood the market and at times make risk-adjusted return a bit more difficult perhaps in illiquid products.</p>
<p>Is it possible that you’d consider more of a liquid credit ramp route in order to get ROE up within SLF, to generate adequate shareholder return, waiting for the potential surplus of capital to diminish and perhaps deploy more into idiosyncratic illiquid specialized opportunities that you guys have done, done well at, in the past?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I think I understand the question. Let’s separate the two. If we have existing assets that we like that have a higher yield or we have pipeline of assets that have higher yield than liquid, those will be contributed first. We do have an active team here that invest in the liquid or semi-liquid club deal market, that has representing now about 20% of what we do at Medley as a firm, not MCC but the firm, so our ability to look at that more liquid assets, is something that is being evaluated.</p>
<p>Would we contribute those type of assets? The answer is, if we believe that that was accretive to NII, that is something we will look at. If you look at one-to-one leverage on liquid assets taking capital away from the average yield of the portfolio today, I don’t know that you would find that buying liquid assets at one turn would give you that pickup. But if we can find things that we’d like we are not constrained, and it would not unreasonable to expect Jonathan that we would put assets like that in the portfolio to help the ramp. But it would be only if it was accretive, not just to do a deal in the market if it had any negative impact on the marginal NII.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Bock</span></strong></p>
<p>Totally understand and appreciate it. Then, Brook, also asking a question as it relates to the share repurchase, which I very much appreciate the comments of its utilization over the next two quarters, which is great and so trying not to split this question one way or another. Just curious, is there a reason you kind of tried to slow repurchases this quarter based on perhaps facility reviews or re-reviews?</p>
<p>And then now we’ll become, after getting the lenders on board, more aggressive in the next two quarters? I'm trying to actually my own question. But curiousness we will receive from investors is just: why the lull now with the ramp towards year end understanding that either are both very positive?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for the question. You answered your question. But I’ll recapitulate it to make sure I got it right. We purchased on a daily basis in the first quarter with purpose, the second we focused on extending and amending our credit facility. I think we did imply in the prior call that we had both balance sheet target leverage constrains. They remained liquidity in the stock as a constrains and there were certain covenant issues that we just as a risk matter didn’t want to bump up against too closely.</p>
<p>We anticipated the amend-and-extend. It has given us significant flexibility which is positive for the balance sheet. And as risk mitigant on the balance sheet and we’re now in the position to go back to the pace that we were before. So there’s was no subjective slowdown other than risk and credit details, so we’re back on a pace, and there is no ramp, we’re going to just be back and doing it at the pace we had been initially, and that’s the reason.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Bock</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes; appreciate that. And then finally, Sam, I know you mentioned kind of outside of Family Christian, relative marks generally kind of in line with your expectation. Just one mark that we saw that's a name that has generated just a few news items would be Modern Video, which I believe took an additional four plus million dollar loss unrealized drop in the quarter. So, Brook Sam to the extent that you able just a discussion on that realizing that from a fair value perspective that’s small but at times when news items hit, it’s a good opportunity to remind us kind the position to focus and where you’re moving in the next few quarters? That’s it from me. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Jonathan. Yes. This was small loss is not immaterial, any loss or markdown we take very seriously, so the size is not relevant to the level of effort and energy we put into this stuff. Over the quarter it has been announced that the assets of MVF were merge with Point 360. We believe that the combination creates a very strong number two player. This is the content management and postproduction services industry. We support the management team and we think there is opportunity both on the cost and revenue synergy side as well as growth within the industry taking share.</p>
<p>Our assessment was this was the best opportunity to maximize the value over time. Our valuations -- now getting to this question of valuation which is not insignificant, we value it on a Level 3 basis and until we see the combination and the synergies, independent valuation with the metrics and the process that we will use to value this, we have to stick with. So, we will and have the intension and expect to capture value here.</p>
<p>On a personal level I think getting back all of our capital here is ambitious. If you look back to the initial investment its not off the table, but our team is going to be focused extremely hard on supporting this business and getting back as much of our initially investment as we possibly can.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question will be from the line of Doug Harter, Credit Suisse.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Harter</span></strong></p>
<p>Looking through the portfolio, I guess how would you characterize kind of loans that are on watch list and not great, non-accrual? But how would you view the performance of the credit quality as we look forward into the coming quarters?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Doug. It’s hard to tell. We obviously value these positions independently. From a credit perspective we’ve taken ground on fixing issues, obviously some of these comes with attending to Family Christian and things like Modern Video. We had begun to see positive tractions on several of the positions that we’re optimistic on. So if took a static view today or we did, I think we would look to see, begin to see some positive signs holding everything equal. That is just the bias.</p>
<p>From a macro perspective, if we look back a quarter or two, we saw low 2%, 3% revenue and EBITDA growth on a portfolio wide basis. It’s difficult to look on a granular quarterly basis, but on balance we’ve seen slightly lower revenue on EBITDA growth if you looked at it on an apples-to-apples trailing 12 month basis. I would not describe that as indicative of return, but we are watching it closely. So, that’s a long-winded answer, but we feel somewhat constructive at this point if everything were static.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Harter</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question will be from the line of Troy Ward, KBW.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Troy Ward</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you, and good morning guys. Brook, first on the buyback, when we were getting ready for this call we just assumed there was going to be a lot of questions regarding why the buyback was quite a bit lighter this quarter. And it's great to hear your confidence about completing that buyback over the next two quarters, as well as some color on why you stepped back a little bit in the June quarter. So appreciate that. We hammer a lot of guys on buyback; it’s good to see you actually doing it.</p>
<p>As we think about the income statement, you commented on a previous answer to a question that the yields seem to have stabilized and expected the more volatile item now, probably as we see it, is fee income. So the absolute level of fee income has declined, obviously, with lower activity in the portfolio. Its kind of the run rate over the last couple quarters has been, call that $2.5 million range. Is that what we should maybe expect going forward given the available capital that you have to make movements in the portfolio?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s a good question. I don’t think I have an easy answer. I think our sense is we will have fee income that has to do with prepayments, new investments as well as any amendment or other extensions that are done in a positive way. I don’t know whether that’s a realistic number, I think if they don’t have the better one I would say, the run rate that we’re producing seems sensible to use.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Troy Ward</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks. And then, just some housekeeping on the model, make sure we have it right. The credit facility you just rated, what is the committed size of that, and what is the unused fee on that facility?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Committed is 517, and the unused, let me just track that down real quick, 50 basis points.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Troy Ward</span></strong></p>
<p>50 bps? Okay; just to make sure the model is right. Then is the -- I saw in the Q and then you mentioned it, the rating agency; I think it’s a 25 basis point benefit if you get a positive rating. Is that a new wrinkle? Is that just added this time, or was that already in there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>That is added this time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Troy Ward</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And have you started that process, and are you actively in dialogue with the agencies?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>We are at the forefront of that process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Troy Ward</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. That’s all my questions. Thanks.</p>

<p>Your next question will be from line of Casey Alexander, Gilford Securities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good morning. Most of my questions have been answered, but the addition of the $20 million to the SBA debentures, is that -- should I read that as potentially that we are going to see some portfolio growth this quarter through the SBA subsidiary? Or is that to a certain extent sort of replacing something on the non-SBA side of the business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, let me make sure I understand the question. We expect the SBIC will grow to the extent that we’re buying back stock which we intent to. That’s going to be a shrink.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>So I think apples to apples if we didn’t change the target leverage I don’t think we’re going to expect to be growing the portfolio materially. You may see some total asset growth as we begin to ramp the SLS.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>But that’s going to be – I don’t think you should look at that as portfolio. It won’t show up. It’s going to be in the subsidiary. So, we will be producing more assets, but it’s not going to show up as a balance sheet portfolio growth.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And the SLS actually, if I understand this right, you guys haven’t started funding the SLS yet?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>We have not started.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Next, it appears as though Calloway Labs has stabilized a little bit. Is there any -- I mean, can you give us some color on the pace of working that out? Are there any improvements? I mean I think its good news that it stabilized quarter to quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me put it this way. If there was significantly good news to report we will report it. I think at this point given the effort and time that we’re putting in this, its tempting to want to be positive. I think what we’re going to do is, when we actually have really specific information to give on the positive side, we’ll give it to you. And until then I think we just after all of the efforts has gone on and it will continue to go on. I don’t want to over characterize it yet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s fair. All right. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Casey.</p>

<p>Your next question will be from the line of Christopher Testa, National Securities Corporation.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Testa</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good morning guys. Most of my questions have been answered. But just with regards to the JV, Brook, how long do you think that’s going to take to ramp in use the entire $100 million of the Credit Suisse facility before you uptake more leverage in that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, let me separate the question, Chris.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Testa</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Is we’re going to continue pursue more financing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Testa</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re not going to wait to make efforts to expand that financing line. We decided with out partner Credit Suisse. We’ve very strong relationship with them on many fronts that we’re better to get that started and then we’ll expand it. That’s not waiting based upon asset ramp. I think the idea of committing the capital. Its early 2016 would be a target. Again, it’s really going to be dependent and I think the question from Jonathan was appropriate and leading. It’s going to be dependent upon opportunities that we see in the market.</p>
<p>But if we did opportunities and given the capability to originate on the platform her e which is really outside of MCC at this point in terms of capital, I think you begin. We would have a target of early 2016, but it may extend and that will be based upon opportunities we see not any specific reason to hold back the ramp of that portfolio.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Testa</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks. That’s helpful. And just with repurchases, if you’re committed to do the $20 million over the next couple of quarters and say the discount on an out basis really compresses with your stock, would you be willing to possibly put off the repurchase the following quarter to pursue investment opportunities or is that something you’re solidly intent on doing and completing the remaining $20 million?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re going to put the $20 million to work; I mean that’s our intent today. If the question is if immediately we went back to book value from a trading perspective would we still do it? I think the answer is we’re going to have to evaluate that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Testa</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>But that’s a little bit of hypothetical in the future. We would expect to be in dialogue with your all, but I just want to leave you with the thought that based upon what’s a realistic view here as we look forward we’re going to put that money into the repurchase and we’re going to complete it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Testa</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just my last question is just general broad market question, in term of what you’re seeing in credit quality across the board and how do you think of your asset mix going forward kind of between the first and second lien?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>As I commented before, we’re putting more and more attention on making sure we have senior and secured positions. We like other investors are looking at macro impacts. We’re not calling the markets or returns, but we’re aware of the volatility in certain sub sectors and we’re using our expertise in these areas to make specific decisions on sectors. But the overriding theme is senior secured, given that we’re not going to be ramping the MCC portfolio. It’s hard to see that shift in the mix, right. That’s going to hard to move the existing mix if we’re not doing new stuff. But on the margin, the themes are floating rate, first lien where possible. Second lean, more secured and I would say on bias, increasing the quality and size of the positions in terms of the borrowers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Christopher Testa</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. That’s all from me. Thanks you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brook Taube</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Chris.</p>
