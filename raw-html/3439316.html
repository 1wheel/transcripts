<p>Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the Ithaca Energy Half-Year 2015 Financial Results Conference Call. My name is Shannon, and I’ll be the coordinator for today’s conference. I would now hand over to your host, Les Thomas, CEO to begin the call. Les, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Les Thomas</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good afternoon to everyone here on this side of the Atlantic, and good morning to those of you listening in North America. Welcome to our first-half results presentation. This is Les Thomas. With me today are Graham Forbes and Richard Smith. I think most of you have already spoken with the three of us before.</p>
<p>Today, in addition to providing a summary of the first-half results, we’ll take the opportunity to provide a short operations update. We’ll use the presentation material that is available on our website. And Graham and I will be alternating to cover all of the material. Once we’ve completed the presentation, we will take questions.</p>
<p>And I’ll kick things off with Slide #3 in the presentation, hitting the highlights before handing over to Graham to cover the financial results.</p>
<p>The second quarter has continued in much the same vein as the first. We believe we have a good news with really two themes. Firstly, solid operating cash flow from our producing assets, and secondly, steady progress on the Stella development.</p>
<p>Today’s results show that even though in lower oil price environment, the company’s producing asset portfolio is generating strong cash flow from operations, especially being driven by solid operational performance across all the main producing fields, delivering average production of 12,578 barrels per day, which is in line with our full-year guidance of 12,000.</p>
<p>On the last call, we spoke about the ongoing work to reduce the company’s operating cost base and this has continued to deliver benefits. Our OpEx through the first-half of $35 per BOE is down 31% from 2014. We also spoke last time about the cash flow protection provided by our oil hedging position. We have two years of oil hedging in place from volume of 6,400 barrels per day at $70 a barrel. In light of current prices, this is an important benefit.</p>
<p>At the end of June, the net drawn debt position was $788 million. When we consider $30 million net cash receipts for the sale of our Norwegian business and the forecast operating cash flows for the remainder of the year, we expect peak net debt prior to Stella start-up to remain below $800 million.</p>
<p>Finally, we continued to progress the GSA development. Technip have just completed laying the oil export pipeline to connect to the tanker loading facilities. All of the work has gone according to plan, and apart from final tie-ins, we’re essentially complete for 2015.</p>
<p>In Poland, Petrofac continued to make progress on the modifications to the FPF-1 vessel. The third quarter involves a transition from predominantly construction activities and to the start of the commissioning process. And that is ongoing at the moment. I’ll cover that in a little more detail later.</p>
<p>So I’ll now hand over to Graham to view our first-half performance.</p>
<p><strong>Graham Forbes</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Les. I plan to repeat the format we used at the end of the first quarter and with that, three slides. I’ll start off with a key underlying metrics over the first-half of the year on a per barrel basis. Then discuss the cash flow and earnings generation, and finally look ahead at funding and how the cash flow of the business looks alongside of debt facilities.</p>
<p>So starting on Slide 4. We have the comparison of 2014 with the first-half of 2015, and on the left, you see increased production by 15% to 12,600 barrels of oil equivalent per day. As Les mentioned, with the annual planned shutdowns taking place in Q3, this is fully in line with a full-year guidance of 12,000 per day. The producing asset portfolio performed well with first six months of the year, with solid operational uptime achieved across all the main fields.</p>
<p>Good progress was made over the period on the production enhancement activities scheduled for this year. And the only 2015 activity, still ongoing, is continuation of the workover campaign in Wytch Farm. The Ythan field development was completed and put up on line at the end of May. The production levels have been encouraging. The planned shutdown at Sullom Voe Terminal was successfully completed in mid-July, which should now allow us to get a longer run of production data from Ythan, and thereby, allow us to assess the full opportunity for additional development in the area.</p>
<p>The planned maintenance shutdowns have gone well with all fields back on line apart from Cook. Cook is midway through its shutdown and this is also going according to plan.</p>
<p>The second chart comparison reflects the impact of lower oil prices. It shows that overall realized hydrocarbon price dropping from a level of $96 realized in 2014. Option to hedging, we would have been looking at $55 per BOE, but with a substantial hedging gone, the hedges in place for the first six months of the year resulted in an overall realized price of $78.</p>
<p>Now importantly these numbers do not include the benefit of the $60 million hedging gain acceleration from future quarters that we discussed in 1Q. This is a one-off gain. These numbers just take account of the hedges when we include six months period.</p>
<p>Going forward however, as Les mentioned, we have a very strong hedging position with over half of the oil production from our existing producing fields hedged for the next two years, an average of 6,400 barrels per day at $70 per barrel.</p>
<p>But if we start those average volume hedges a little further, we have over 8,800 barrels per day hedged for the next 12 months at $70 and then the hedging reduces to 4,000 per day for the 12 months thereafter. But it should also be remembered that over and above that, we have around 5,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day of gas hedged over a 24-month period [ph] with a floor price of 63 pence per therm. That’s heavily in the money compared to where U.S., U.K. gas is trading today.</p>
<p>So if we may turn to operating cost which are the key to maintaining strong netbacks in times of challenging Brent pricing. With the Q1 results, we started to see the steep reductions in OpEx costs coming through, both from improvement of the portfolio mix and from supply chain initiatives taken in the back of the steep fall in oil prices. The portfolio change I referred to is of course the replacement of the high cost Beatrice and Jacky fields with lower cost Pierce, Wytch Farm in production from the Summit acquisition.</p>
<p>Regarding cost deflation, we’ve seen that continue now for seven or eight months, since we are comfortable to revise our full-year forecast for the year, down from $40 per barrel to the $35 level achieved over the first-half of the year. Beyond 2015, we’re going on Stella with operating costs of $12 to $15 per BOE, resulting in another major step-down from the blended operating cost to around $25 mark.</p>
<p>Just as we did at the Q1 results, I just want to quickly remind everyone of the footnote at the bottom, which explains that onerous contract provision was set-up at the end of 2014 for discontinuing fields; Beatrice, Athena and Anglia, which means that any revenues in operating costs associated with those assets are offset against the balance sheet provision, and therefore do not feature in the income statement this quarter.</p>
<p>As a result for example, if we’re just looking at operating costs in the income statement, you’d see a much lower operating cost than that used to calculate the unit rates shown in the slide. We’ve added the field operating costs of all producing fields together in these calcs to get on top of like-for-like comparison.</p>
<p>If you could now turn to Slide 5, we can pick up on the reported six monthly financial figures. Once again we put income statement into the cash components at the top and the mainly non-cash components were down. And from that, we can look at what generates a strong cash flow from ongoing operations of $160 million and earnings of $14.1 million over six months.</p>
<p>We can see that although production is up compared to the same period in 2014, the oil price collapse of nearly $50 leaves revenues down 45% at a little over $116 million. However, from a cash perspective, our hedges have done the job intended and increased cash flow by over $110 million. $50 million around $22 per barrel being hedges in the period which have crystallized and $60 million being the acceleration of the cash values of hedges in future periods, previously discussed in Q1.</p>
<p>We can also see a 37% reduction in operating costs through the income statement to $57.6 million for the reasons we discussed in the previous slide. G&amp;A costs, they are down 51 - G&amp;A costs are at $51.1 million - G&amp;A costs are at $5.1 million in 2015. And that’s before recovering the Norwegian costs at completion of $2 million. Take those out of the equation and G&amp;A costs account for running the business over the first six months stand at $3.1 million. This reflects the significant measures taken in-house to squeeze down upon all overheads.</p>
<p>After taking account of a $4 million exchange loss, this adds up to a cash flow from ongoing operations of over $160 million. Again a footnote at the bottom reminds us, if we add the onerous contract provisions released for the old fields, the cash flow from ops stand at $140 million, which conveys a very healthy cash flow per share in the first half of the year of $0.43.</p>
<p>Turning to the non-cash items and finance costs. The increase in finance costs compared to the comparable period last year is as expected, with higher interest costs as we reached peak debt levels. Depreciation rates are down to under $30 per BOE, driving the overall charge to $62.3 million. And we can also see that we have a sizable non-cash on the realized hedging loss in the period.</p>
<p>The income statement had already reflected much of the gains and hedges held at the 2014 year-end. Back then, they were value-adjusted based on the forward curve when Brent was already trading at $55 per barrel. As a result, to the extent that those gains already booked in the account are now realized in cash terms, we simply see much of the volume from income statement moving from non-cash up to the cash section.</p>
<p>We also accounted for the $60 million sale of Norway in the period, which resulted in a cash settlement after paying off all Norwegian debt of over $30 million, the funds being received after the reporting period on the July 8. Taxation for the six months has a sizable credit of $32.5 million. This is despite the impact of a deferred tax charge of over $41 million as a result of the U.K. government ruling oil and gas tax rates, which we discussed in the first quarter of the year. So the credit partly arises from the disposal of the Norwegian business, but the biggest impact was the recognition in the six months of capital allowances and by Ithica from expenditure on the modification of FPF-1 vessel, which is over the cap cost and therefore is being paid for by Petrofac.</p>
<p>The tax value credited for those to capital allowances received in the first six months of the year is $24.4 million. Of course as part of this initial sale and purchase agreement, we will, in recognition of these additional capital allowances, make a payment to Petrofac five years after Stella first-oil estimating the tax deductible value of the allowances which will be a function of the tax rates applicable in the U.K. at that time. So quite a bit of noise going through the income statement given rise to the $14.1 million earnings for the six months.</p>
<p>So probably just to summarize and to hone in on the cash flow generation and how the business is really performing, we see the production is good, strong hedging is boosting income and both operating costs and overheads are significantly reduced.</p>
<p>So let's now to go to Slide 6 and look at the funding of the business. If we look at the graph on the left, we can see the debt has increased modestly by $25 million from $763 million at the start of the year to $788 million at June 30. Although hedging and cash flow covered the CapEx, we had, as we expected, a washout of the working capital as a result of the drilling on Stella and Ythan coming to an end and the subsea work nearing completion.</p>
<p>Looking at how we expect remaining working capital to unwind over the year, then taking account and see Norway. We’re now forecasting that debt should remain under $800 million as opposed to the $825 million debt level previously advised. In addition, we also don’t see too much sensitivity to that number in respect to Brent, given the strong hedging in place over the next 12 months of near 75% of our current production forecast for this year.</p>
<p>So with the new extended RBL facility is $650 million put in place on top of $300 million senior notes, which are out to 2019. That takes up to two facilities to $950 million. This sets comfortably compared to our funding needs prior to Stella start-up being in the $750 million to $800 million range.</p>
<p>And now let me take just the CapEx onto the chart on the right, which together with hedging is the other reason for increasing confidence in our funding needs. As you heard from Les in the Stella update, we are very well advanced in Stella and have new offshore drilling planned anywhere in the company before Stella’s first hydrocarbons. This means we have CapEx of under $50 million remains to spend this year with similar levels in 2016.</p>
<p>So with that, I’ll hand you back to Les on a fuller Stella update.</p>
<p><strong>Les Thomas</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Let's move onto Slide #7 and a short status update on Stella, where we continued to steadily progress remaining works and put scope and risk behind us.</p>
<p>Starting with drilling. Just a reminder, that we have five wells completed, cleaned up and ready to produce with tested productive capacity in excess of 53,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day.</p>
<p>Next, the 2015 subsea infrastructure installation program has progressed according to plan, and is materially complete. The 2.7 kilometer oil pipeline to the tanker loading buoy has been laid, backfilled and surveyed to allow the final tie-in spills at either end to be installed in October of this year. 2015 works are really as almost complete. The remaining scope is the vessel installation and hook-up activities that will be completed once the FPF-1 arrives on location next year.</p>
<p>On the FPF-1 modifications program, Petrofac are making progress on the completion of the outstanding construction works in Gdansk, which continues to advance towards the planned vessel sale-away from Poland at the end of first quarter in 2016.</p>
<p>If we turn to Slide 8, you get a little more color regarding current activities in the yard. Operations are focused on closing out the main topside construction scope and transitioning into the start-up of commissioning operations. Pipework pressure testing on the topsides processing and utility systems is well advanced and extra manpower is being applied to the subsequent reinstatement work in preparation for commissioning. Electrical and instrument cable drilling, landing on termination are also well advanced with clearly facilitate the commencement of the main commissioning phase.</p>
<p>Completion activities such as the installation of fire and gas end-devices, painting, the application of passive fire protection and the installation of deck grating are also underway.</p>
<p>Pre-commissioning activities are ongoing with various equipment packages and sub-systems being prepared and site acceptance testing of the integrated control and safety system equipment is in progress. Temporary power has been established to the living quarters. Electrical loop checking is underway and the instrument air distribution system is energized.</p>
<p>These activities are all part of the preparation for the transition to the main commissioning phase.</p>
<p>In summary, mining remains at record high levels and scope and risk are being put behind us on a weekly basis. Delivery of the FPF-1 remains a critical part item to first-oil and there is no change to the forecasted schedule.</p>
<p>So if you turn to the final slide, I would conclude by emphasizing that we’re in the process of executing on a very clear plan. In simple terms, really just two elements to the plan. Firstly, we’re maximizing operating cash flow from our existing producing assets by means of solid operational performance, reduced costs to flow and significant hedging.</p>
<p>Secondly, we’re making steady progress on the Stella project, liquidating work scopes and putting the risk behind us, and all of this while maintaining strict financial discipline, eliminating non-essential spend and prioritizing our investments to ensure that we have the financial headroom to deliver Stella as planned.</p>
<p>We are pleased with the first-half results, show that we are delivering on both elements of the plan.</p>
<p>So with that, I’ll now stop and invite questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question today comes from the line of Ritesh Gaggar from GMP. Ritesh, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ritesh Gaggar</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple of questions please. Firstly on Athena field, under the new arrangement with BW Offshore. Do you have any payments that needs to be made once you start your production later during the year? Are there any outstanding payments to be made to the BW Offshore or any other party?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Short answer for that is no.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ritesh Gaggar</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. And in terms of decommissioning costs for, not only Athena, but also Anglia field. How much do you expect your share will be and you actually expect to expand money on decommissioning of both these fields?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, let me give you the numbers there. Let me just explain and make sure there is no confusion about timing here. The Anglia field, we are now committed to cessation of production in September of this year. So we have got plans in place for that to happen and for the Anglia facilities to be disconnected and isolated from the remaining production system that’s managed by ConocoPhillips. So that will definitely take place and we have work underway to make sure that.</p>
<p>With regard to Athena, we’re not committed yet to cessation of production. I think there is a careful balance here at the moment between oil price, production volumes and operating costs. And the way we set out the field as with the contractor, there will be no cost for the [indiscernible] open book arrangements where we’re completely trying to find - we’re keeping the field going as long as possible. So in simple terms, at $60, we’re very comfortable. At $50, it’s more challenging but it’s not - we’re not committed the cessation of production.</p>
<p>So the timing of Anglia and Athena is really dependent on production volumes, where we manage to increase production recently, while optimizing our electrical submersible pumps and also of course keep minimum pressure on operating costs. So we’re back in the business and we’re going to maintain Athena on production as long as it makes sense. And as far as on BW, working in tandem, very clear about that. So that’s the story of how we’re managing it.</p>
<p>In terms of the numbers, Graham, I think you’ve got the decommissioning costs that we got it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Graham Forbes</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, the cost of partial commissioning Athena and Anglia is probably similar in the book, just under $20 million our share. Clearly over the last 10, 20 years, those numbers have only gone one way, but we feel more optimistic on the current climate enable those downward pressures on those dwell. In terms of timing, we do expect decommissioning of Athena to be before 2018, and Anglia to well beyond 2020 before there is effective decommissioning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ritesh Gaggar</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. And just one little question on the Stella FPF-1 facility. You mentioned that nine hours have been increased quite dramatically over the last couple of quarters. I just want to know in terms of the contingency that has been built in terms of bringing or the sale-away before Q1 next year or towards the end of Q1 next year. How much buffer do you actually have in terms of that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I think the way I like to say is that we, as Ithaca, have taken a view that sale-away was going to be at the end of Q1 and we’re being consistent about that. So Petrofac and Remontowa in the yard are working to a schedule. They are well assured that that happens. They are working to a schedule between Petrofac and Remontowa have got an incentive in place and so they are working to be able to get ready before that. And so that has relevant scope between the two. I think I would be lying if I told you exactly Remontowa and Petrofac feel about the schedule that they are working too, but we’re confident everything that we see that the plan that we’ve put out there is deliverable [ph] and that’s what everyone is working to.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ritesh Gaggar</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question today comes from Nathan Piper from RBC Capital. Nathan, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Piper</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for the call. Just a quick one, looking into next year a little bit. You mentioned around about $50 million of CapEx for 2016. But can you please tell to one side, how do you see productions going next year given good way through 2015?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, you’re looking ahead there, Nathan. Normally, we wouldn’t give guidance for the year in terms of production until you expect us to do that until January. There bias that are really a couple of things. We mentioned earlier that we’re working hard, but we’re not sure when that will show. So that’s one factor, a small factor, that’s not a huge thing. Fortunately we’re still into the season of budget discussions with a range of partners and that’s really going to take three or four months to work through until we can get agreement on each of our joint-ventures in terms of who are we going to send because there may be some well work to do, to manage production of their main oil. So we’re working through that process before we’d be comfortable a bit putting a guidance out.</p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say, we have said before, that in terms of CapEx and [indiscernible], we’re planning to fall to the minimum requirement into the level of Stella. So that means that just staying on our assets is liable to be not much, until you can clear on completion about production handing but we’re not ready to give guidance on that yet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Piper</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question today comes from James Carmichael from Peel Hunt. James. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Carmichael</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning guys. Just a couple of quick ones on Stella. Regarding the sale-away in late Q1, I was wondering if you could just talk a little bit in more detail, how you see the timeline from the sale-away just passed out in Q2. What are the elements involved in this? How we should think about it? And then you also talked in the past about the fifth well, giving it a bit more flexibility to increase liquids production. Given the current oil price, I’m just wondering how you’re thinking about the initial production rates and if that still makes sense? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, with the first part of that, we’ve always said that the time span between the sale-away and ready for first production is about three months. So that’s where - that’s why we get from end of Q1 to end of Q2. So that’s pretty simple. Just again a bit more rate going on that. What has to happen? Well, we’ve got to the range from get on to site. That’s about two weeks. Then the next thing is you have to moore the vessel. As we have pre-laid all the remaining lanes on the seabed and the anchor pile on the board is driven. So what happens when the vessel gets to stay is we have anchor handling boat will pick-up the mooring lanes and make the connections and get the whole thing merge. And that is four weeks.</p>
<p>So having done that, there is then we have to sea rises and then belt core [ph] to connect the vessel to the rise on the belt core piece. So that’s basically to connect the vessel on the subsea infrastructure that’s already installed. And that’s likely Technip will do. And we’re currently looking at couple of weeks there or three weeks. And then physically we’ll talk to a member in the offshore who come commissioning phase, so that’s making sure that everything is connected properly, making sure the systems are working, making sure everything - control system and everything talks to everything else. There is several weeks to get that all being done, before we’re ready to start up.</p>
<p>There are formalities at the end of course in terms of making sure that we’ve got all the certificates in place that the agency regulators are happy with everything before we bring - comes on board. So as a sequence, it’s very detailed and very clear of what need to do, it amounts in total to about three months and that’s what we are building to the program. So that was the first part.</p>
<p>I guess you’d be asking that the fifth well and liquid production and start-up. I think the way to think about this very simply is that the fact we had a very good fifth well is giving us more productive capacity. This was great news. We’re looking a double benefit really in the fifth well as the lowest gas/oil ratio well in the field. But that’s the process [ph] that we’re using and the platform will get more liquid zone. So two things there. When we start-up, we’ll start up with the lowest gas/oil ratio well and we’ll do that because initially you have to flow some gas to get the compressors running, get running up to full production, so that there is nice whole GOR [ph] available to be able to make production but we’re still commissioning the compressors.</p>
<p>And then of course we’ve always said that the production philosophy of the harp is to keep the gas plants still and to maximize liquid take-off within that limit, and the fact our fifth well with a little gas/oil ratio should be in that we’re able to make more production. And that’s what we’ll do.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Carmichael</span></strong></p>
<p>And what impacted by oil price [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I don’t think we need to get ourselves on with anything but price take-up environment. We control what we can control which is production, efficiency and cost, that we are probably take-up. So that’s the way it works.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Carmichael</span></strong></p>
<p>That makes sense. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question today is from [indiscernible] please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. My question is, I’m seeing that the July gas price in the last six months was $43 per barrel of oil equivalent. What’s management’s view on the oil and gas price in your [indiscernible]?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I think I’ll go back to my previous question [indiscernible]. So I don’t know if that does a great deal of good to tell an opinion. I do think, Graham mentioned, we’ve got hedging that we have in place earlier which is substantially ahead of where prices are currently. So that’s a benefit. So we will - we’ll take opportunities to hedge where we can where it’s the benefit. And I’m not sure I can really help you with the gas price forecast [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question today comes from Dave Round from BMO Capital Markets. David, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Round</span></strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon guys. Just going back to the core portfolio. We saw some downward reserve revisions at the year-end. We obviously now seen sustained weakness of the oil price, or this is probably using fairly delayed price effects. You’ve mentioned CapEx reductions a couple of times. So I guess going forward and I guess moving towards the year-end, should we be expecting further downward revisions to again producing portfolio, and where in particular should we be looking?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, that’s a great question, David. Very complex to answer, because a lot fine for us to enter that. We did have a cycle of work here that we lifted towards the year-end in order to look at the producing fields and see whether there are any impairments to be had and those are process the training of that. We haven't started that yet. I think it will be, in other way, pre-judge any outcome there. That will happen in due course, but I think you’re right to highlight that that’s something ourselves and others will be doing. So we will do that.</p>
<p>I would just emphasize that we work on what we can catch on. We have got very significant reduction in our OpEx from last year to this year. That plays a part as you go into impairment calculations, and we don’t stopped on that, we need to control but we can't control and we’ll continue to do that, where all little levers work out the issues to have the best outcome. So it’s a great question. I don’t think we can answer until the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Round</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question today comes from Nick Bowles from Moore Capital. Nick, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nick Bowles</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi guys. Thanks for taking the question. Just in relation to your RBL. Could you remind me on the terms of that please, and how that might be revised or change the given changes to price indexed used by banks?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Graham Forbes</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. In terms of RBL, we went through the extension of that facility back in the spring time. So that’s now in place now I think well towards the end of 2018. In terms of RBL, what exactly we’re seeing is more [indiscernible] in terms of a discounted cash flows - future cash flows based on the BOE productions costs and the oil price.</p>
<p>In terms of the ratios the banks work at of your future cash flows and portion of that. So looking at RBL means senior part lends us about two-thirds of our future cash flows which is based on conservative assumptions of one piece in Stella and I will prompt [indiscernible] a little bit and that’s really all the ways to it. There is no sort of historic components to it, and that any maintenance covenants of that nature. Does that answer the question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nick Bowles</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Sure, thanks. So just one more follow-up. So you believe that you will have full liquidity available for Stella start-up, so the $575 million of the senior and $75 million of the junior is fully available?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Graham Forbes</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s something engaged six monthly basis and that figure in the nature of an RBL. They stay comfortable as where we are there. And obviously from accounts when we did before because we’ve been able to reduce the peak debt requirements. So I believe, we’re $78 million with a peak debt is going to be under $800 million. In some ways we may be seeing the peak debt at $788 million, but either way, we think it will stay on the $800 million and that’s why you can see from the facilities were in good shape at the moment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nick Bowles</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question today comes from Kate Sloan from Macquarie. Kate, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kate Sloan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi guys. Just a quick question looking out to 2016, 2017, once you’re comfortable with Stella production. How are you thinking about both on opportunities that are now in the lower oil price environment easing and you may just wanting to get - wanting to disposal of potential assets and are you having any conversations on that front? And so when should we expect to see those opportunities coming into the portfolio?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. Well, let me say first of all that, we’re absolutely focused on Stella, but that’s what we are first of all. So like get ahead of ourselves, we’re completely focused on that. But if we do look ahead, we tend to think, we are in this universe of opportunities in the North Sea. We have the best opportunities and where do we like.</p>
<p>And in a relatively low oil price environment, you want things - it’s pretty simple really, isn't it? We want things with low CapEx per BOE and low OpEx per BOE. I think the fact that we’re in the process of putting this production have in place and all this infrastructure in place, we know that a good place to spend some more money on low CapEx per BOE and low OpEx per BOE as greatest area and that’s the whole reason for the strategy. So I think the satellite opportunities at Stella are high up on the list.</p>
<p>I think we have said before that we’ve got several conversations ongoing right now in the area. We’ve signed confidentiality agreements and such to allow those things to go on. And I don’t want to say anything else about that. I think just know that we’re working it as you would expect us to be. I think it all sets - there are lot of dynamics that set everyone [ph]. So we can benefit now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kate Sloan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, good. Thanks Les.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Les Thomas</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Kate.</p>

<p>Okay. Thanks Shannon. I guess we’re done. Thanks very much everybody for participating. Bye-bye.</p>
