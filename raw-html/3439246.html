<p><strong>Dmitry Loschinin</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, good day everyone. As always we are happy to have you with us to share the results of the first quarter of our new financial year ending March 31, 2016. I am pleased to say that our company continues to enjoy robust momentum, demand for our services solutions and expertise is strong. It allowed us to generate top-line performance of 32% year-over-year and 8% sequentially. Top-line growth in constant currency was over 45% year-over-year. As you know we are vigilant about managing our profitability. This metrics also showed an impressive annual dynamic. Adjusted EBITDA grew 42% and non-GAAP net income grew 41%. Roman will give you more color on the subject later.</p>
<p>All of our verticals are focused to performed as anticipated. The core three being the strongest, financial services, auto and telecom that posted 38%, 24% and 21% annual growth respectively. Our technology business which predominantly concentrates on the areas of embedded development Internet of Things and big data finds more and more cross vertical applications. This is attracting interest from customers in retail, manufacturing, logistics and other segment. There by posting this stellar performance growing over 50% year-over-year. We continue on the path of delivery and end-to-end services as a next generation IT provider. The demand for software development capabilities and the main focus technical knowledge is thriving.</p>
<p>Therefore we have been experiencing a steady increase in productivity for the past several years. During the past 12 months it stands at about 8% reaching $74,000 in annual revenue per billable engineer as of June 30th based on a quarterly dynamic. While we maintain top-line gross rate of around 30% for the past several consecutive quarters would like to emphasize a high quality of hedge growth and improving key metrics to which all of you are paying attention.</p>
<p>Top 10 accounts concentration has decreased in line with our promise, it is down 10% on year-over-year basis and 2% on quarter-over-quarter basis. The group is responsible for 75% of the total revenue versus 85 year ago.</p>
<p>New accounts in the top 10 list this quarter versus year ago quarter includes Credit Suisse and Microsoft. Top three accounts concentration is down 7%, top five account concentration as you know its Deutsche Bank is down to 33% from 37% a year ago. This solidified our status with this client and made that into Deutsche Bank strategic partner program. I’ll talk about this in a few minutes within the financial services overview.</p>
<p>Also our geographies exhibited a healthy growth rate. Due to recent M&amp;A activity current mix between the U.S. and Europe has shifted towards Europe, 49% growth 58% now. That happened mostly due to the extensive excellence client base concentrate in the region, as well as several major high potential accounts that have been ramping up they worked in that area.</p>
<p>They secure at least to transformation engagements both with major financial groups in Western Europe. One is related to redesigned legacy architecture and winding down some business units while the other relates to provision of services to create a new generation digital banking enterprise. While our Luxoft global upgrade program has been successfully completed we continue lowering concentration in terms of engineering headcount in Ukraine and diversifying our global footprint by means of growing other allocations such as Poland, Romania and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>Just to remind we value our IT talent and have numerous internal HR initiatives to develop it and preserve it. We continue high in all of our geographies and now initiate layoffs. The lower concentration resulted purely from the internal mobility relocation programs and the accelerated growth of our delivery centers in the Eastern European portion of EU. So far we have relocated over 700 employees over the last 15 months. We find that recurring on our relocation strategy is an effective way for us to scale and at the same time to continue diversifying our delivery organization.</p>
<p>For example, Poland is currently our fastest growing location with 168% increase since June 30, 2014 and Romania is up 40% since that day. At the same time the portion of our engineering staff located in Ukraine is down to 38% as of June 30 compared to 49% on March 31, 2014. The portion of the engineer staff in Russia is down to 23%. Our attrition is staying in the healthy historical range of 9% to 11% declining at the end of the first quarter to 9.9% from 10.7% in the previous quarter. The other three more high potential accounts from telecom technology and financial services sectors, we now have over 35 accounts on the HPA list which in the aggregate grow approximately 8% year-over-year and attribute more than 10% to our total revenue this year. This had potentially caused answer to lowering revenue concentration and bringing diversity to our revenue by client.</p>
<p>Let’s talk about highlight of the vertical progress; financial services. As anticipated, this remains to be the fastest growing core vertical. It delivered 38% annual revenue growth. The contribution towards fast growth has been made by more seasoned high potential accounts as well as by accounts from the top 10 list. We were able to accelerate development of one of our main HPAs which is now transitioning numerous engagements into the managed care delivery mode. As I mentioned at the beginning of our call, we are very proud to have made the list of strategic vendor partners on the global scale for our top one customer Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p>Deutsche Bank strategic partner program was successfully launched in June 2014 to concentrate on the few strategic vendors capable to deliver the most profound business impact across all categories of the bank. It covers our 20 vendor relationship for the bank worldwide in all areas including technology service. Specifically the information technology services Luxoft has become one of only four strategic vendor partners. We are excited to further strengthen our already seasoned 12 year relationship with Deutsche Bank. We believe that our clients including Deutsche Bank, Luxoft has knowledgeable and innovative vendor capable to keep up with the rapid changes in the [tech] area and help financial institutions to remain relevant and competitive.</p>
<p>Combination of engineering capabilities, solutions and our team’s knowledge of capital market’s financial products and related regulations is helping us keep the strategic vendor status in Deutsche Bank and grow this numerous other clients in this domain. On a broader scale, we are continuing to protect our specialized demand capabilities in the financial services sector by undertaking various object specific engagements within equity order management system, can equity trading risk and variation system.</p>
<p>Our Luxoft market’s team was able to win multiyear deal that start-up with the engagement in the area of syndicated loans. This project was taken away from another large IT services vendors due to the qualitative issues. The engagement is a part of a major infrastructure upgrade at one of our Western European client, Romania Bank in Northern Europe. The overall initiative enrolls right in a completely new architecture for a mix of different asset classes and lifecycles.</p>
<p>We are excited to be part of this major overhaul project and confident that we can help this bank and our other clients in that space to adapt to the disruptive changes driven by digital and other technologies in that sector.</p>
<p>Speaking of digital disruption and other mega trends, I am sure some of you have already heard of Bank 3.0 console. It has been introduced by a technology future an innovator in the banking area Brett King late last year covering the inevitable change coming into the banking sector driven by mobile wallet, social media, tablets, digital consumer notion, Bitcoin technology, et cetera. Bank 3.0 is about the transition from banking dependent on a physical structure to the virtual ecosystem that can accommodate mobile and Internet driven end user interaction, yet without sacrificing their human touch. It’s about leveraging the potential of Big Data and analytics for better one but the one on one interactions in more powerful markets.</p>
<p>Therefore offering that fits perfectly into this new generation of Bank 3.0 notion and we have to give you an update on this subject later this year. We actually already secured a transformational engagement with one of the largest financial services group in Western Europe to become a provider that will start transitioning this client towards a digital bank of the future. Excelian integration is well underway and it has been progressing as planned on all fronts. First we are improving the metrics to bring Excelian margins to the double-digit level.</p>
<p>Second we are actively consolidating our sales effort. Excelian is entering a several large account of Luxoft and bring Luxoft mainstream services to major account of Excelian. Here is a great example for our joint success, recently Luxoft and Excelian have forged and partnership with some of their largest and dependent information technology and business process forms in the world to bring reliable industrialized and standard size trading and risk management platform to various financial institutions and corporate treasuries in the form of software the service SIS within its valuation.</p>
<p>The alliance between the two companies combines establish IT delivery at a rate frameworks and industry utility experience is our establish expert knowledge of trading systems and superior consultant capability. With this offering we were able to become a preferred vendor for a new significant financial service retail focus client from Western Europe securing a five year engagement which is also transformation in nature. While the full scope of the engagement is still being defined it will include the commissioning of legacy systems and translate in business division.</p>
<p>Horizon update, Horizon continues to deliver robust pipeline of list as well as driving the revenues from the engagement that have already been launched this major financial institution the Europe union. Strong pressure required by the regulatory environment on the industry has put into the spot light the best platforms that can aggregate and visualize data.</p>
<p>Luxoft Horizon is a perfect resolution for such dilemmas. For example, we have been running an implementation of Basel committee of bank provision for a top level group of UK to strengthen banks risk data aggregation capability and turnover risk reporting practices. The new areas of potential application for our customers are insurance, if you have received a strong interest from insurance industry later to risk management and the point, as well as liquidity risk monitoring utilize in Horizon dashboard.</p>
<p>Digitalization, big data, Internet-of-Things and Advanced Data Visualization are all examples of accelerating pace of technological change, Luxoft Horizon this is continued market success and increased brand awareness is attracting attention of potential customers not only in financial services, but also beyond, for example telecom [indiscernible].</p>
<p>[indiscernible] has continuous expansion and is the second fastest source of revenue growth for our company with 24% expansion year-over-year. The actual business growth was higher but due to the revenue recognition on some of the fix price engagements as all see the revenue later this year. And therefore we will see growth rate for this vertical in the next quarters. New engagement opportunities are coming from such areas of machine telematics, computer vision and autonomous driving. As it is their case is most of all significant clients the potential pipeline is visible several years ahead.</p>
<p>We are very encouraged by all of the opportunities that are coming due to ramp-up, we started the work as one of the most prominent Germen OEMs based on our direct contract for them. The work has commenced in the areas of computer vision and HMI for the upper class remodels, based on the solid backlog of the month -- this client we believe should be rapidly becoming a significantly HPA account one of the major ones on the list.</p>
<p>HMI continues to be a very popular topic, with high interest. We further developed HMI tool chain [TEORA] tool and corporate in the newest trends in HMI and the overall architecture. The new version of TEORA is now fully integrated to Populus to write digital cluster related court and the more simplistic HMI. We just won a new contract there thanks to Populus. Lastly we see very high growth opportunities one of our HPAs which is a permanent tier 1 supplier and recently started aggressively ramping up our service team. Once again they primarily work license there of HMI and telematics. Over the first quarter our automotive team has been working on the wide array of HMI related engagements earning up on parallel experience and further sharpening their expertise.</p>
<p>We have a series of recognition from the third-parties that we are proud and excited to share just a couple of days prior to our Investor Day in June, Luxoft awarded Best Connected Car System Integrator 2015 award by TU-Automotive, out of all 400 nominations, a panel of expert judges has picked up the winners in each of the 12 categories and Luxoft one competing in the final round against 12 providers inclusion auto, Elektrobit, Qualcomm technology, Symphony Telecom and others. Also .CONECT awarded Luxoft most innovative Human Machine Interface feature. The award was received for a new comfort climate, the latest innovation of Luxoft within HMI domain. This feature improves fuel interaction with the vehicles climate control system, delivering superior in vehicle use experience. Luxoft received the second place following Continental and ahead of Ford which took the third place.</p>
<p>Let’s now turn to the telecoms. As you have seen from the dynamic of the past quarters, this vertical has been improving significantly. It now posted 21% year-over-year growth fueled by the opportunities related to the latest technology in the network function virtualization, software defined networks and demand for quality insurance services. Today, I would like to introduce you to the Managing Director responsible for business development in this domain, Maik Lankau. Some of the investors have already met Maik at our Investor Day in New York and also at some of the investor meetings and conferences.</p>
<p>Maik will give you an overview of the latest segment development and at the end of our call, you can ask him any questions related to his area of expertise. Maik, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Maik Lankau</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Dmitry. Hello everyone. Over the past quarter, we’ve been focused on acquiring new partners like Expo, which is the service assurance company providing next generation monitoring solutions and handheld field testers for the tier one into two carrier markets. Some of you attended our investors day in June may remember that Expo spoke about their relationship with Luxoft in more detail. We’re also very fortunate to count [COPAN] Wireless as one of our new partners and for those of you who are not familiar with [COPAN] the [COPAN] Group offers a wide range of technologies and services across commercial defense and security markets.</p>
<p>So now to [COPAN] Wireless we are also happy to report that we are expanding our business within -- with several adjacent business units that we have in our business prior. We truly believe that close and trusted partnerships with our clients meaning trusted advisor partnerships with clients enabling them to meet the stringent go to market demand, product innovations required today will give us a much needed broader market reach to discover and growth on new opportunities.</p>
<p>This will also enhance our ability to scale in a variety of geographies especially in the Americas and Europe. Partnering simply lowers our cost of sales and provides us with new and steady revenue streams. Close collaboration with our partners also help us identify new growth segments and that’s key in our particular vertical. One example we’re working with our partner Expo on their new product which is called Extract to help them go to market faster and enable their time to revenue. It opens up data analytics for real time operation as a new growth segment. So that means that into today’s network environment it is imperative that data processing is fast enough to keep up without that processing.</p>
<p>So let’s talk about the trends that we see when our customers talking with us on that product portfolio. Carriers and enterprise customer demand continues to undergo significant transformation in our market sector. The impact of digitization and the virtualization of service devices and content help us with the evolution of underlining network technologies and really created a disruptive change to most technology companies in our industry.</p>
<p>Virtualization of network functionality has had a mixed impact in our market sector so far with some customers embracing the new flexibility that this aggregation of software and hardware brings while others have struggled to adapt to the changes in the common technology base. Helping customers manage and evolve through the transition to network functionalization promises to open up additional growth opportunities for Luxoft at the testing, certification services and service assurance solutions for virtual network.</p>
<p>Our ability to understand and add value to our customer efforts depends on our ability to learn these new and emerging technologies at a rapid pace. Applying our learnings and to carry an enterprise environment so we can satisfy our customers’ desire to achieve the benefits that network virtualization promises.</p>
<p>Our core engineering development services including test automation remain to be valuable contributions to our customers’ product plan. Furthermore we see a tightening of skills resources tools and our customer base making our ability to recruit and hire talent particularly attracted to our customers. The combination of high value add on type engagements and our cost efficient engineering development services give us an optimum value across the mix. Our ability to deliver software engineering and test services to network equipment vendors, analytic tool vendors and service providers remains the core element of our service offering over the next six to 12 months.</p>
<p>To ensure that our telecom vertical will stay on the path of dynamic growth, we continue to primarily focus on wins that combine our existing skills with cross lines of business skills and in the areas of user interface and user experience, virtual machine to virtual network function transformation, Big Data and IoT, Internet of Things. This fusion of skills adds tremendous value to our customers and differentiates Luxoft’s telecom business unit above all other telecom software system integrators.</p>
<p>Dmitry?</p>
<p><strong>Dmitry Loschinin</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Maik. Big Data and IoT are certainly the topics that are becoming more and more relevant every day in numerous segments of our economy. The segment is up over 50% in revenues on a year-over-year basis. By now we have for the most part fully integrated traders into our Luxoft holding structure in the form of horizontal IoT practice and have aligned our efforts in the area to vertical industries.</p>
<p>Recently wins include one of the largest retail [barrier] chains in the United States as well as new big engagements in Microsoft, which is our top 10 client. We have a lot of other late in motion at this time. Full integration of products on the operation and customer account front is expected to be wrapped up by the end of this financial year. Among on the additional wins in this vertical, I would like to highlight a new client which is a large scale digital media player. It took all of the work on several platforms since that client replacing a large multinational technology and consulting corporation.</p>
<p>I would like to wrap up my overview on this upbeat note and once again state how excited</p>
<p>and once again state how excited we are with this all of the progress made in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this always, let me highlight some of the awards and recognitions. We have over dozen awards, reports, recognition in honorable managements and various sources. I already mentioned two wins [indiscernible] and here are some additional examples. Luxoft was ranked as a leader in the 2015 Global Outsourcing 100 List by IAP. Luxoft [indiscernible] as a major contender because of a significant job and our delivery capability ratings in service provider landscape but done by Everest. Luxoft was listed in the category the breakthrough 10 Sourcing Standouts on ISG Quarterly Outsourcing Index call; we were also listed in the same category on the call in the first quarter. Finally in Gartner Research, Luxoft was listed as number 8 as compared to number 25 in 2014 on the Top 25 Fastest ITO Growing Providers.</p>
<p>With this, I would like to pass the call to Roman who will provide you with all of the financial details for the quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Roman Yakushkin</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Dmitry. Hope everyone is doing well today. Thank you for being on the call with us. Let me go over some numbers and give additional color for our operational financial dynamic for the first three months of fiscal year ending March 31, 2016.</p>
<p>Revenue generated by Luxoft during the first quarter amounted to $148.1 million, as compared to $137.4 million in the fourth quarter of the previous year and $112.3 million in the year ago quarter. This translates into an increase 31.8% year-over-year and increase of 7.8% sequentially.</p>
<p>In constant currency terms, the top-line amounted to $163.5 million, as compared to $112.3 million in the first quarter of the previous year. That corresponds to 45.6% year-over-year increase.</p>
<p>Revenue breakdown by geography was as follows, UK increased 56.3% year-over-year and amounted to 35.8% of the total; U.S. increased 5.6% year-over-year to comprise 31.5% of the total revenue; Germany increased 17.9% to 12.1% of the total; Russia increased 3.9% to 5.7% of the total; Switzerland increased 71% to 2.7% of the total; Rest of Europe increased 172.3%, now comprise 7% of the total; other geographies increased 63.1% now comprised 5.2% of the total.</p>
<p>Revenue breakdown by verticals was as follows: Financial services vertical amounted to 70% of total sales that represents an increase of 37.8% year-over-year; automotive and transport 9.7% of total sales, an increase of 23.9% year-over-year; technology vertical 7.2% of the total revenue and an increase of 58.5% year-over-year; telecom comprised 5.8% of the total revenue and an increase of 21.1% year-over-year; travel and aviation vertical comprise 4.9% of total sales and decrease of 9.2% year-over-year; energy contributed 2.1% of total sales, an increase of 0.5% year-over-year. Fixed price contract during the first quarter amounted to 55% of our revenue as compared to 56% that we report a year ago and compared to 57% in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>We are pleased to report the development of our HPA organically and by acquisitions, brought our concentration down dramatically. Our top five accounts amounted to 66.1% of sales representing 9.7% decrease year-over-year and 0.1% decrease sequentially. Our top 10 accounts for the same quarter amounted to 74.7% of sales which represents 9.9% decrease on year-over-year basis and 1.4% decrease sequentially.</p>
<p>Top three client dynamics: Our top three accounts remain to be Deutsche Bank, UBS and Harman. In the first quarter, Deutsche Bank amounted to 33.1% of sales, down from 36.9% year ago quarter, representing 18.2% increase on year-over-year basis and 12.7% increase sequentially. At the same time, UBS grew by 30.1% to 20.7% of sales from 20.9% a year ago and increased by 7.2% from 20.8% of total revenue in the previous quarter. In the first quarter of financial year 2016, Harman comprised to 6.7% of total revenue, it is 4.1% decrease year-over-year and 0.9% decrease sequentially. This decrease attributable to the shift of several large fix price contract to the subsequent quarters.</p>
<p>Moving on to the profitability metrics. For the quarter ended June 30, adjusted EBITDA was $27.2 million versus $19.1 million in the same quarter for last financial year and $19.8 million in the previous quarter. This represents 42.5% growth year-over-year and 37.2% sequential growth, respectively. Our adjusted EBITDA margin was 18.4% versus 17% in the first quarter of last year and 14.4% in the last quarter. Operating income margin in the first quarter on a U.S. GAAP basis was 10.3% and the non-GAAP basis the margin was 14.9%. Our GAAP net income margin in the first quarter was 9.9% compared to 11.2% a year ago and 6.6% in the fourth quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Our non-GAAP net income for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 was $20.6 million versus $14.6 million in the year ago quarter and $15.1 million in the previous quarter ended March 31, 2015. Our non-GAAP net income margin in the first quarter was 13.9% compared to 13% year-over-year and compared to 11% in previous quarter. In the first quarter 2016, foreign exchange gain in the income statement amounted to $1.1 million.</p>
<p>One of the most frequent investor questions for the past six months is about our currency breakdown. So, given the past quarter, the future looks as follows: On the revenue side, U.S. dollar 55%; euro 29%; Great Britain pound 6%; ruble 3%; others 7%, and on the cost side, U.S. dollar 47%; Ruble 16%; Great Britain pound 12%; Romania RON 9%; Polish zloty 9%; Swiss franc 3%; euro 2%; and others 2%.</p>
<p>Our effective tax rate for the quarter ended June 30th was 13.5% versus 10.3% in the first quarter of the last year and 7.5% in the previous quarter. It is unchanged from the last year’s rate which was 13.5%. Weighted average diluted share account for the past quarter was 33.9 million shares, an increase of 0.8 million shares from the previous quarter. Our diluted EPS amounted to $0.43 per share as compared to $0.27 per share in the previous quarter and $0.38 per share in the first quarter a year ago. On a non-GAAP basis, our diluted EPS were $0.61 per share compared to $0.46 per share in the last year of 2015 fiscal year and $0.45 in the first quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Let’s move to the balance sheet. Luxoft finished the first quarter with approximately $59.9 million in cash and cash equivalents on its accounts. The company continued to generate healthy cash flow. Operation activities generated $22.5 million or 15.2% of revenue. Financing activities used $2.6 million of cash and net cash of $20.8 million was used in investing activities which includes the $15 million short-term bank deposit. Our free cash flow to revenue ratio was 10.5% and Luxoft is basically debt free. We ended first quarter with only $0.8 million in total debt as compared to the total borrowings at the end of the first quarter last year of $15.2 million.</p>
<p>Our CapEx remains the same quarter-over-quarter, approximately 4% of revenues. As of June 30, our trade receivables including unbilled revenue were approximately $135.1 million compared to $136.5 million as of March 31, 2015. Unbilled revenues are down from $34.3 million as of March 31, 2015 to $14.7 million as of June 30th that is a 57.1% decrease due to some early billing of our low cap customers.</p>
<p>At the end of the first quarter, day sales outstanding excluding unbilled and deferred revenues stood at 68 days, up by 1 day from 67 days in the previous quarter. Full DSO including unbilled and deferred revenues stood at 79 days, down by 3 days from 82 days last quarter.</p>
<p>We have finished the quarter with 9,535 personnel, of which, 8,050 were IT professionals. Attrition in the first quarter was 9.9%, down from 10.5% as of March 31, 2015. Utilization remains stable at 80% level. Our annualized revenue per engineer is now $74,400 which represents an 8% year-over-year increase in productivity or 3.9% increase on a sequential basis.</p>
<p>Before I conclude, we would like to leave you with an updated outlook for the full financial year ending March 31, 2016. We expect to continue delivering solid revenue growth. We confirm our guidance for the end of the financial year 2016 of achieving at least $640.3 million in sales. This represents an increase of at least 22% year-over-year in USD terms. In the weighted average 2015 fiscal year currencies, we expect this growth to be at least 26%.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA margin expectation remains unchanged, as always, in the range between 17% and 19%. Diluted EPS is expected to be at least $2.02 per share on a GAAP basis and at least $2.55 per share on a non-GAAP basis, up from the previous $2 per share and $2.52 per share respectively.</p>
<p>The EPS is based on an estimated weighted average of 34,057,503 diluted shares as of the end of our financial year ending March 31, 2016. The number of shares has slightly increased versus the originally announced guidance because a great amount of shares needs to be issued in accordance with our stock option plan due to the significant depreciation for our share price over the last several months.</p>
<p>With this we are opening the lines and look forward to your questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. We will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question comes from the line of Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Christiansen</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Peter in for Steve. Thanks for taking my question. Roman, I’m not sure if it was mentioned what organic growth was, also organic growth in constant currency?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roman Yakushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>The growth was 31.8% and if you excluded Excelian, it would be 20.5% and without Radius, it is about 16%. In constant currency, growth is 45.6%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Christiansen</span></strong></p>
<p>If I look at the changes in headcount on a sequentially basis, it looks like engineer growth of about 200 employees is little bit on the lower side, but is that -- versus prior quarter’s. Is that anyway a response to some of the lower attrition that you’ve seen? And do you expect -- what kind of headcount are you expecting to grow over the next 12 months?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>Once that is anything really out of our standard pattern, the growth was obviously driven by the business needs and we are doing quite fine in bringing new engineers to perform activities with existing and new clients. So, we’ll check the numbers. Probably the growth during the year is anticipated to be little lower as usually than the growth of the top-line.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Christiansen</span></strong></p>
<p>Is it related to 6% growth in the U.S.? Could one infer that how the Radius is -- majority of that growth there and have you been able to realize revenue synergies from the Radius deal and how is that progressing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure. The growth you can see in terms of the headcount attributable to some extent to Radius. As for the synergies between Radius offering and Luxoft, we talked about that on the call, so that we currently have couple of new clients which are able to acquire as just a standalone IT practice from Luxoft as well as some of their old clients of Radius there becoming large accounts of Luxoft including Microsoft and leveraging our services across the globe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Christiansen</span></strong></p>
<p>And I guess my final question is as it pertains to Deutsche Bank, there is a lot of structural changes going on with that client. Do you anticipate -- and it’s great that your relationship continues to be very strong with them. But we’ve seen this in the past when some of your major clients undergoing their own internal changes, sometimes that leads to decision delays. Do you sense that there could be any interruption over the intermediate term with plans? I know they have talked about spending 1 billion in digital and also incorporating a lot of efficiency gains in other areas of the bank. But as I said, sometimes we’ve had decision delays with these situations. Do you anticipate anything over the near-term?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>Despite all of the changes and challenges that DB is facing, on the IT side they formed during last 12 months very strong I’d say management team which is quite decisive. And they have put plan in place and I would not expect any delay from the execution and overall, surprises from DB. So being one of four key supplier in that space, we see several things, one is that we really know in advance about their plans and how can we play; and two there is still ongoing consolidation of those vendors who are eliminated from the list. And it’s quite substantial amount for us. So again, we don’t anticipate Deutsche to continue growth as it was last year. And again, we have some impact from euro being 20% lower and the contract is in euro mainly. But at the same time, we do not anticipate any decrease for upcoming years. So, we believe that it still continue being a very large share account, maybe the number one for a while and they still see lots of opportunities across the bank. We haven’t started working it in the retail part which is completely untapped by us at the moment and now we have a hunting license there. So, we will see it. I am very optimistic.</p>

<p>Our next question comes from the line of Charles Brennan with Credit Suisse. Please proceed with your questions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Brennan</span></strong></p>
<p>I was wondering if you could just add a few comments about the margin performance. It looks fractionally weak to me. Maybe you could start with just telling us what the FX impact on the margin was for the quarter. I guess excluding FX, we’d be looking at a pretty sizeable year-on-year decline in margin. Can you break that margin decline down from the dilution you got from Excelian, maybe the added costs from the global program and then the amount you’ve given away and price pressure?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roman Yakushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>Speaking about the FX influence on the margins in the first quarter, the impact is not very big if you compare to the first quarter last year. So, we actually compute it in a weighted average currencies of the first quarter last year, the top and bottom lines. And the net negative effect on the top line is about $1.5 million whereas net positive effect on the margins is about $1.2 million. So that’s how it translate to.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>We also disagree to your statement conclusion that the margins are weak. We have grown more of the same, even higher than the top line growth and it’s very usual pattern of our fiscal year behavior. We have usually weaker margins in the last quarter of our fiscal year and first quarter because of some of the overheads we pay for the social contribution and things like that, especially in Russia. But overall it’s pretty strong, why do you say it’s weak?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roman Yakushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>And again, if you look at the margins in different currencies, the overall net positive effect will be only 1 million. So, it is basically a quite minimal and even in last year currencies still have had strong margins as what we show today.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Brennan</span></strong></p>
<p>But just to confirm then, if we would have backed out that 1 million, I guess that would have been a year on year decline in underlying operating margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roman Yakushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>What do you mean by year on year decline of the margins? The margin would still have been strong but with difference of just 1 million and that’s the to the decline of euros. So, the decline of euro from 1.35 to 1.10 from the last year cost negative effect to top line and some positive effect to the bottom line. And also the fall of the ruble from the last year cost some again negative effect on the top line and positive effect on the bottom line. So essentially all the major currencies last year have been fallen versus the U.S. dollar and again, the numbers on the net effect are already spoke out.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Brennan</span></strong></p>
<p>And we’ll obviously be able to do this especially later. [Ph] But if we back out Deutsche, and we back out UBS and we back out the impact from acquisitions, what would have been the growth in the rest of the Luxoft business year on year? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, as I told you the organic growth without Excelian and Radius was slightly about 15%. And Deutsche Bank grew by, on year-over-year basis by 13%l; UBS grew by 30%. So, if you subtract it organic, I mean from the total growth, the non-organic component, Deutsche Bank and UBS, I would say that the growth would still be around 20% level. Because we had number of strong runner up high potential accounts that grew more than 100% year-over-year basis. We had new additions to the top 10 list, we had Microsoft, we have Credit Suisse, some other names which contributed very positively to the growth of the top line.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Brennan</span></strong></p>
<p>And just lastly, I won’t hold any longer but just lastly. I was struggling to calculate your FX impact in my spreadsheet; I was coming up with numbers much closure to 7%. Can you just send us around the rates that you use to calculate your numbers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roman Yakushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we can send you the rates after the call. But as I told you, the weighted average for euro was 1.37 for the first quarter last year and ruble was definitely below than 65 but we can show the data to you after the call, no problem.</p>

<p>[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Vladimir Bespalov with VTB Capital. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vladimir Bespalov</span></strong></p>
<p>I have a couple of questions, first is on your stock-based compensation. This has increased quite significantly and probably due to your acquisitions. So, could you provide us some guidance how this is going to develop in subsequent quarters through the end of this year, maybe some guidance for the longer term periods?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roman Yakushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>Was your question about the share count?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vladimir Bespalov</span></strong></p>
<p>It was about the stock-based compensation, about this increase expenses stock-based compensation and how do you see this developing in subsequent quarters and through the end of this year, maybe for a longer term period, if you have it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roman Yakushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>I understand the question. The increase of the stock-based compensation expenses last year is simply attributable to the fact that we have adopted, implemented new program from December last year. So, if you compare it to the first quarter last year, we didn’t have SOT 3 [ph] program we only had residual a SOT 2 [ph] program and the total expense was about $8,000. Whereas for the first quarter this year, while we implemented new program, it increased to $4.1 million. So, going forward we should expect roughly similar quarterly expense for the next three, four quarters with total for this year being around $15 million, $16 million expense.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vladimir Bespalov</span></strong></p>
<p>And my other question is on your allocation program. As far as I understand, your goal is to have less than 25% personnel in each geography. And currently in Ukraine, even though it reduced significantly, you have about 39%. So, are you going to reduce these; how long does it take for you to reduce this to 25%, if you’re going to pursue this and what does this mean for you cost and for your margins?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>Once we initiated a global upgrade program, we said that the program was prospect from two to three years, the final goal of diversifying on delivery operation in a way that we don’t have any single allocation which contributes more than 25%. In two years horizon, it was said that you would like to bring any given geography below 205. So that’s our goal this year to get Ukrainian in concentration below 30%. And we expect to reach the final ultimate goal next -- in the year 2017, fiscal year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vladimir Bespalov</span></strong></p>
<p>And in terms of cost, so what will this mean for you, some additional costs, some pressure on margins; what do you expect?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>As you can see, we have decreased the concentration in Ukraine by more than 10%, without comprising the margins. So, we have some extra costs which are mainly attributable to the relocation programs. And as we reported, we have relocated up to now more than 700 employees and engineers. So, it’s substantial number and kind of the biggest bulk of the relocation has been completed. So going forward, even though we’ll have some extra cost associated with relocation and the redistribution of the workforce, we do not anticipate any margin dilutions for the company. We will manage that.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is a follow-up question from Steven Milunovich with UBS. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Milunovich</span></strong></p>
<p>Dmitry, with some of these new accounts and new businesses that you’re bringing on, are you able to realize pricing uplifts? Your client list is kind of been the same for quite some time but now with all these new businesses coming on and contracts, have you realized an improvement in pricing versus your current base of business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we have several accounts which we brought and acquired in the past, there is a completely different nature in terms of the services provided and the value you provided. Still, initially those accounts require investment on our end to setup our teams and then infrastructure and everything, so that we can grow them in the upcoming years. But all of this having been said, we believe that those new account recently like relatively new accounts will be able to demonstrate higher than the usual profile accounts margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Milunovich</span></strong></p>
<p>And then, I guess if I look back over the last two years or so, continually you’ve outperformed your guidance by a pretty wide margin. And considering your guidance methodology, it’s hard to gauge what the outperformance has really been. I guess, could you give us some characterization of how you’re performing versus your own internal expectations; are you outperforming there; do you see a bit more momentum than you had anticipated a couple of months ago?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>Good question. So, we are usually around three plans, I would say the one being conservative, and one being optimistic, the one which we use for ourselves being in between. So, we’d call it realistically conservative and realistically optimistic. Anyway so that the one which we put for ourselves, we’re going ahead of that plan slightly at the beginning but again things look good. You know it’s our pattern and it’s our way to progress throughout the year. So, we use usually the conservative approach. And the more we go and getting closer to the year, the more we are willing to discover but just staying on the safe side.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Milunovich</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m sorry. So, you feel like you’re performing near more towards the optimistic scenario or the realistic?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dmitry Loschinin</span></strong></p>
<p>A bit ahead of our realistic one.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We have no further questions at this time. I would now like to turn the floor back over to management for closing comments.</p>
<p><strong>Dmitry Loschinin</strong></p>
