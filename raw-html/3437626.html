<p><strong>Charles Dauber</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Kevin good morning everyone. I'd like to welcome you all to the American Electric Technologies' second quarter 2015 earnings call. Joining me today is our Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer, Andy Puhala.</p>
<p>For our call today, I'm going to start with a review of our second quarter results and then I'll Andy walk you through some more financial details and I come back with some additional comments on our business. We'll then move to a question-and-answer session coordinated by the moderator.</p>
<p>I'll start by saying that the Company recorded its second consecutive quarter profitability in Q2, when net income from continuing operations in the second quarter of 500,000 up from 300,000 in Q1 of 2015. I’m pleased that in this current oil and gas market environment that we were able to continue to maintain profitability and we’ll discuss further as we continue to our results.</p>
<p>By the way, much of what I’m going to discuss in my comments is Q2 as it compares with Q1 of this year, as I think that's the most relevant comparison given the current energy markets. The tables in our earnings release and our other public filings of course have comparisons versus Q2 2014 and six months comparisons figure review.</p>
<p>Consolidated revenue in Q2 were 12.3 million down from the 15.3 million in Q1 and also down from the 13.4 million in Q2 of last year. Interestingly in that the majority of the drop and revenues actually came from decreases in our Power Generation and Marine and Industrial market sectors which I will speak [ph] on later.</p>
<p>In Q2, our gross profit margin increased to 17%, compared to 15% in both first quarter of this year and the second quarter of 2014. This gross margin improvement is reflective of increase manufacturing efficiencies primarily in Beaumont, Texas facility. Our cost control initiatives implemented this year including a reduction in force and the strong gross margins we are seeing in a new Brazilian operation.</p>
<p>Fully diluted earnings per share from continuing operations were $0.06 per share, up from $0.02 a share in Q1, but down from $0.11 a share in Q2 last year.</p>
<p>I’ll now turn the call over to Andy for some deeper financial discussion before I come back and provide more thoughts on our markets in our business and the outlook for 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Andy Puhala</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Charles. Continuing where Charles left off, fully diluted earnings per share for the quarter was $0.06 per common share compared to the $0.01 in Q2 and the loss of $0.17 in Q2 of last year. Q2 results last year included the impairment and operating losses of the discontinued American Access Technology segment of $0.29 per share or about $2.4 million.</p>
<p>As Charles has already discussed our summary results, I’d like to give a little more detail on a few areas. We’re pleased with the margin improvement that we delivered in the quarter, particularly given the difficult oil price environment. We believe the costs and efficiency improvements in our operations have essentially offset pricing pressures we’ve seen.</p>
<p>The biggest impact on the margins was actually the growth of our Brazil business during the quarter, which consist of relatively good margin services revenue. Brazil generated 950,000 revenue in the quarter, up 56% from Q1 and delivered profits of 260,000 a strongest quarter since it began operations in Q3 of last year. The Brazil result included foreign exchange gains in certain U.S. dollar denominated contracts of just over a $100,000.</p>
<p>Turning to our international joint ventures, the equity income from two foreign joint ventures net of JV related expenses was about 200,000 in the quarter. Our BOMAY joint venture in China had a profitable quarter with revenues 13.4 million, up from 8.8 million in Q1 but down significantly from the 37.6 million in Q2 of 2014. The reduction reflects slowing economic growth in China as well as significantly lower oil price environment versus 2014. BOMAY is an unconsolidated investment in our 40% share of BOMAY's net equity income was 264,000 in the quarter.</p>
<p>Due to the current Chinese economic environment, we expect BOMAY to remain at about the same levels for the remainder of the year and we don’t expect the recent devaluation of the currency to have material impact on our results.</p>
<p>Our joint venture MIEFE in Singapore returned to profitability in the quarter on 1.7 million of revenue in Q2. Our share of the profits was slightly better than breakeven. As we indicated in last quarter’s call, the Southeast Asia oil and gas market is also down this year based on the drop in oil prices but we’re working closely with our joint venture partners Sonepar to integrate MIEFE sales organization to build backlog and improve performance for the company into the second half of 2015.</p>
<p>Our EBITDA non-GAAP measure for the quarter was 0.7 million or 40% increased from the first quarter, down from the 1.2 million in the second quarter of last year. The year-over-year decline being primarily lower at joint venture equity income.</p>
<p>Moving to the balance sheet and cash flows, we ended Q2 with 8.3 million of cash on hand and 5.4 million of total debt. Our working capital needs decreased during the quarter a result of lower revenue levels in the timing of certain payment milestones from our customers. As a result to reduced working capital requirement and strong collection activity, net cash generated from operating activities during the quarter was approximately 3.2 million and for the first six months was 2.7 million. In addition, we received dividend distributions from both our joint ventures during the quarter, totaling about 1.2 million after withholding taxes.</p>
<p>Turning to backlog, we ended the quarter at 16.5 million down from 20.3 million in the first quarter or 8% higher than 15.3 million of backlog at the same time last year. As we said in a quarter given the low oil price environment, we believe the year-over-year backlog increase show the strong progress we’ve made on our sales manufacturing and product offering at this time last year. It also includes about 600,000 of Brazil's backlog.</p>
<p>As a reminder, not all of our business is backlog based. Charles will provide some additional color on the character and sector details of our backlog later in the call. With that, I will turn it back over to Charles for some additional commentary and outlook on the business.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Dauber</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Andy. I would like to now share with you all more about our market sectors and our business. I will start with our oil and gas market sector. As I have highlighted in the previous calls, the company operates in three distinct parts of the oil and gas sector; upstream which is finding and getting the oil and gas out of the ground including leaned and offshore drilling and offshore production; midstream which includes oil and gas pipeline and gas processing applications; and downstream including refining, petrochemical and L&amp;G type products. In the first half of 2015 a land and offshore drilling market activity experienced significant decrease primarily related to the drop in oil prices.</p>
<p>However, our focus on the midstream and downstream related projects within our oil and gas sector was the right move. Oil and gas revenues for the quarter now represent 86% of the company's business. Revenue in this sector was down $1 million versus Q1, but up $0.9 million versus Q2 last year. We continue to see good opportunities related to midstream and downstream natural gas related projects and feel confident in our ability to successfully execute them.</p>
<p>Our sector gross margin for the quarter were 17%, up from 14% in Q1 for the reinforcing of the operational execution issues we have experienced in the second half of last year are well behind us.</p>
<p>With that said, the energy markets that we participate and has continue experience challenges related to drop in oil prices and we continue to price aggressively to maintain appropriate business levels.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, our backlog continues to be lumpy. Our oil and gas related backlog for the quarter was $14.4 million, down from $19.2 million at the end of Q1. We see coating activities increasing and are positive regarding building backlog heading into 2016.</p>
<p>One of the things I would like to discuss further is the continued progress of our M&amp;I Electric Brazil subsidiary which we launched in Q3 last year. This quarter, Andy mentioned M&amp;I Electric Brazil had revenues of over $950,000, which is up over 50% from last quarter. M&amp;I Electric Brazil is focused on providing electrical services primarily to the Brazilian land and offshore oil and gas markets, which still needs services even with the drop in oil prices.</p>
<p>This focus means that although the Brazilian macroeconomic remains challenging we remain positive in our outlook for continued growth for M&amp;I Electric Brazil for the rest of 2015 and beyond.</p>
<p>Andy briefly discussed our BOMAY joint venture, but I would like to share more thoughts on the China market. Our Chinese joint venture BOMAY is still impacted by both the slowing Chinese economy and the reduction in oil prices impacting demand for land drilling rigs inside of China. However, I am pleased that BOMAY with our joint venture Bomco continue to book orders for projects for land drilling outside off China for shipment to customers in South America and the Middle East. And they are confident that revenue and profit levels will remain consistent for the remainder of 2015.</p>
<p>And Singapore joint venture is up and down year, they were profitable in Q2, but are forecasting the challenging second half of 2015, based on the significant slowdown in oil related projects in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p>We have recently hired new general sales manager from a major competitor with significant experience in parallel distribution projects across the region. And we are confident that with our joint venture partner Sonepar that we can build backlog and successfully expand the MIEFE business.</p>
<p>We still see opportunities for growth in the oil and gas sector. We have started seeing the land drilling project opportunities again and have recently closed the land drilling rate power system project for shipment in Q4. We see opportunities today across all sectors of the oil and gas business from land and offshore drilling to midstream and downstream markets I discussed earlier. And know that with the investments we have made in sales and marketing coupled with our balanced approach to the market that we can continue to grow our oil and gas sector business for the rest of 2015 and beyond.</p>
<p>I will now turn to the power generation distribution market sector, which was 1% of our quarterly revenue. As I mentioned before, the sector can be quite lumpy for us which is demonstrated by the $1.7 million in the backlog we booked in Q2. Those orders were for natural gas turbine power generation projects for the major turbine OEM customer. And we are expecting to ship those in the latter part of this year in 2016.</p>
<p>We have really seen an increase in opportunities for natural gas based power generation projects and are still positive on growth in this sector on 2016. Moving in for non-energy related Marine and Industrial Sector, Q2 revenues were $1.6 million compared with $1.2 million in Q1 but down from $2.4 million in Q2 last year.</p>
<p>Backlog for that sector was down 6 million to 4 million, but we continuously opportunities on the non-oil and gas chemical markets on into 2016. So to summarize my comments. First, I’m pleased that the company made money in Q1 and Q2 given us challenging market environment.</p>
<p>Second, we believe that the investments we’ve made last year starting to payoff including result in the operational execution issues from the second half of this year, which are now generating strong customer satisfaction. The operational infrastructure we deployed last year is now in place to further improve productivity and gross margins going forward.</p>
<p>Our first international subsidiary M&amp;I Electric Brazil’s top-line and profit growth starting to kick-in. We’re seeing land drilling opportunities increasing and market reflect in Middle East and South America. We continue to invest in R&amp;D for new technologies which we believe gives us increasing product differentiation, but are just our largest competitors have payoff in 2016. And although overall spending in oil and gas maybe down, we believe there are investments in sales and marketing, are providing us with solid opportunities for growth in North America and we should outperform the market growth as well.</p>
<p>Before we proceed with the Q&amp;A session I’d like to conclude the prepared portion of my comments by thanking our employees for their hard work and our customers and shareholders for their continuing support. The company is positive as we move forward in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>And look forward to continue to executive on our strategy. This concludes the prepared portion of our comments and I’ll now turn the call over to Tony for the Q&amp;A section of the call.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. We’ll take our first question from Bill Dezellem with Tieton Capital. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>First question is relative your commentary about the orders picking up. So we are not seeing that as backlog. So are you really talking to activities that you have seen in the last five or six weeks post in the another quarter, can you provide some insight into that please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, Bill. So actually what I said was that we’re seeing increase opportunities, right, so for the first half of the year in the land drilling market for example very, very, very few opportunities right, literally just not a lot to quote and what we’ve seen in the last two months or so and then started to book is new orders in the land drilling market.</p>
<p>In addition the opportunities in the mid stream and downstream market have also started to increase and we expect to continue build backlog of those increased opportunities going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>And you have started to book quarters as you referenced the one for delivery in Q4 and on land rig side, how far in the mid and downstream?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>We continue to book business consistently through with the quarters. So yes we’ve booked more orders than the end of the quarter and at this time, and that obviously going into the backlog as we report Q3 results.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>That is helpful and actually speaking the backlog I missed the Q2 of ’14 backlog number when you mentioned that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>Q2, we’re up Bill about a 1.5 million versus Q2 of 2014. So year-over-year is positive trend, and just to add a little comment to what Charles said, it’s not unusual for us to slow down or reduction in backlog at the end of Q2, now as we headed into summer, just not as many things but getting booked due to vacations and that kind of things.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>So would it be fair to characterize your, if we’re reading the T-leaves correctly your comments and perspective on the business to be the most positive that you’ve had probably in the last year, as you went into the weakening second half of last year and now rebounding out of that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>I think there is two parts of sort of my -- where my head is up right now. One is that internally the company is in a significantly different position and it was let’s say 12 months ago, the operational issues were behind us the infrastructures in place, the sales and marketing investments are in place all the things that we’ve call it invested in the last 12 months of their including in Brazil and all that starting to payoff. From an external perspective, I still think macroeconomic issues are there, the price of oil still down, issues in China are still there. But I think that in the end, we’re going to control our own destiny in terms of growth, not completely independent of the price of barrel of oil, but the focus on the natural gas midstream and downstream and the power gen I think that we’ve got good opportunities for growth having into 2016 and beyond.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>Great and then relatively to BOMAY, if we heard you correctly, you’re anticipating that the results will be roughly flat in Q3 and Q4 relative to what you have reported during the second quarter. And our recollection is that in the second half that business traditionally falls off, they do the big order in the first half and then things fall off in the second half. So are we missing something or is that a positive surprise?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>No. You’re right on that. Normally we have strong first half of the year and then sort of tail off and the second half and that does not appear to be the case in 2015, I think the expectations are there going to continue with this level of revenue and profits and then equity income for us through the remainder of 2015.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>It different, if we also heard correctly is the sales outside of China would they have historically either not had or not pursued, is that right and is that some indication for this JV building to a more worldwide organization rather in China centric?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>I think what is, they’ve always had part of the business was China, I’ll call China deployed systems and part has been the thing that have shift internationally. So overall revenue level they’re going to have be down year-over-year and overall profit will be down last year versus last year, because of the Chinese internal deployment. So I think what we really seeing is that they’ve always had an interesting business outside of China, they’re trying to continue to grow that business and trying to help them. And so that’s really the foundation of what our business is this year, what I just missing is the internal Chinese growth demand from there that portion of the revenue last year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>And finally before I turn the line over. Talk a little more about Brazil if you would please, I think congratulations are in order with what you’ve accomplished so far. But it sounds like that just the beginning and you’re believing that were built maybe quite substantially from here?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>I’ll pass along the congratulations the Brazil team, thank you. So Brazil is very interesting. Brazil only does as I mentioned the services for the land in offshore drilling markets, the offshore production markets and some midstream and downstream and other electrical segments in the Brazil market. So they’ve done a great-great job getting on approved suppliers list we’re now in the Petrobras, approved suppliers list for some of our services. So they’re growing that business nicely and making money, which is great are concerning the macroeconomic environment and the oil market in Brazil.</p>
<p>So we expect, I’ll call it nice solid growth from them continuing throughout the rest of this year and on into 2016. The interesting part of Brazil is that we’re also especially well positioned for when the Brazil market turns back on, some of the Brazil corruption issues at basically that caused a lot of existing suppliers exit the market of a kicked off the approved supplier lists, we are a new company but with a lot of experience in Brazil and a very literally white reputation, we just don’t do any bad stuff let those other people did.</p>
<p>So as the business picks backup and we’re very well positioned to take a strong leadership role and some of the new products, that’s why the new projects that are doing from either a construction and/or products perspective, but that’s going to depend on Brazil market growth and I can’t give you really strong forecast one that’s going to comeback around. We just know we’ve got a solid program and with some very significant upside as things turnaround in Brazil.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Dezellem</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And actually going to take this one step further. You have had good success on the services front and you’ve talk about that all along in Brazil. What about the U.S? Is that something that you could or should be carrying here to the stage or are you already doing that and we do not fully appreciate the capabilities that you are bringing here?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it's probably all the above. We are certainly doing it. We have reorganized internally to get greater emphasis on what we call our electrical and instrumentation group which is both field construction and services. We right now have got a VP In-charge of that business. We are bringing on more services sales people to accelerate the focus there. And services is a part of the business, it's just more hidden within our old previous technical products and services after reporting segment revenue.</p>
<p>At this point we consolidated all of our reporting segments into one business, so you can't necessarily see what portion is product versus construction versus services. So we have had a services business. We think that the need in the down market for services will remain strong. We have been aligning resources there and expect to continue to build that business. And that's again as part of the ongoing margin improvement which is these services have nice margin with them.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Meanwhile we will move to Greg Ayers with Singular Research. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>Following up on that last question. Can you describe how much of revenue in the quarter was not performed out of backlog but rather was called the booked and shipped in the same quarter which include the services business. Just to give us kind of a magnitude idea of, because people seeing the focus on backlog and it's not all coming out of, revenue is not all coming out of backlog, right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, Greg, while Andy is looking in his charts, let me just talk about it for a second. Actually it's a really important point for us, which is we have a portion of our business that is services oriented that really has not a backlog based part of the business and Andy will come up with the number in a minute. And in addition there is also an amount of short cycle work that we do, right. We may get a project and that would be a medium size piece of switch gear and that does not take four months to do it that's a 2 month project and that just does not show up in backlog. Just gets booked and built and shipped all in the same quarter. So we are not a 100% backlog business, Andy going to about proximate number here.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>It's probably $1 million to $2 million in a normal quarter as non-backlog portion of our business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, and $1 million to $2 million in an average quarter. And are you intent on trying to grow that part of the business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I mean that's the point that we are talking about which is the thing the services business has a continued area of opportunity for us and that's been in spite the growth in Brazil and the work we are doing in terms of aligning resources in the U.S. and it's complimentary to the product side of the business and those two things actually worked together to help us differentiate versus our competitors.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>Next question of, as you completed the Belmont facility expansion well back, part of thesis was that that it enabled you to be ready to bid on significantly larger projects and you need to grow the business because now you could not been on being forward. Are you seeing those size projects available for you to bid on and are you bidding on them and what's the success factor there? I mean is theses playing out?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Clear question, I would have put this because we are not formally tracking this, but we actually have more $10 million plus projects in our project funnel I will call it than any time in the company's history ever maybe in the past we may have had one that we tried to chase, but literally we have more than we have ever had before a significantly more. And so what's interesting about those is that this goes back to this backlog discussion which is right now the majority of our business is backlog with sort of 4 to 6 month delivery time that's what the majority of our projects are.</p>
<p>So what we are trying to do is we are trying to say at one end we are getting more services business which is a low backlog or very-very short time horizon, but on these larger projects, these larger projects we are trying to books orders now for delivery in 2016 and 2017, so there maybe longer as project goes longer cycle time.</p>
<p>So yes, I mean we are enthusiastic when customers come to the plant. We are getting out of the approved suppliers list at very-very large engineering procurement and construction companies. We are taking customers away from major competitors and sort of working our way up to the size projects so we may have an initial project from an engineering or procurement in construction company for downstream or for chemical project which is a $2 or $3 million project and as we execute that we’ll now we’re lined up for the $5 and $10 million plus project. So nothing to report order-wise publically but we’re enthusiastic about the progress.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>As you bid on those larger projects, are they for the same customers that you’ve served in smaller size projects or is this a whole new customer list that you have into break into?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Most of them are customers that we’ve broken into in the last year or so, okay. So, prior to that we didn’t have the sales team, we didn’t have the capacity, we didn’t have the products actually go after those that level of customer and we’ve got the plan, we got the products, we got the capacity, we’ve got the sale, we have now on the approved suppliers list, we’re start to getting the initial quarters and now we’re lined up for these much-much larger projects that we have proof points, that we can actually pull off, right.</p>
<p>So I think this is a part of this growth plan, which is we’ve significantly elevated our profile in the industry and we can now take on the largest competitors that would be out there, head-to-head and go after these customers as we’ve already started doing over the last year, with break in the pipeline market and the refining market and the chemical market against sort of the bigger folks in the industry.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Next question kind of trying to understand what’s actually behind and driving your optimism for second half bookings and revenue, I was kind of Bill’s question was about you saw increased opportunities some in the land side, and mid-stream and downstream seem to be cooperating loss of, but what’s changed in the marketplace can you put your finger on it to say, why are things better now than it really back in late winter, what’s different about the marketplace?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So two things, one is I think we’ve seen a slightly rebound in the market in the last now versus over the last six months in the land drilling part of the business which is essentially dry up, right so we’ve no, almost no orders in the first half of the year for land drilling and just started seeing those opportunities again and sort of what’s called May-ish and start to booking orders and that's the huge upside for us right.</p>
<p>And we continue to see opportunities in the midstream and downstream power generation parts of the business. It may have shifted from oil pipelines to more natural gas processing plans but we still see those opportunities, I think the reason for my, I don’t want call my optimism, but my cautious optimism is, I think that we are not so tied to the growth in the market.</p>
<p>We’re not some gigantic company where we’ve already got 80% of the market and which really go up and down with the markets ups and downs. We still a relatively small percentage of the overall market for electrical systems into the energy industry. So we move ourselves, our sales guys get large projects that moves our needle significantly. It doesn’t take two or three projects that increase our overall revenue for the year or any particular quarter by relatively sizable amount.</p>
<p>So I think we have seen some rebound in the market opportunities, right and I just think we’re seeing that our sales investments are working in the way through and I’m cautiously optimistic will probably the right word about company’s headwind into 2016.</p>
<p>By the way, it doesn’t mean we don't have ups and downs between, and we sort of progressed through this market, because we’re still in the tough market there is no question about it, but that sort of what you are getting.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>I understand that about your last year, at this time bidding in the third quarter, you saw its experiencing problems with the manufacturing and delivery of the PDC units, you worked through that in the second half last year, maybe you changes, can you describe how the manufacturing efficiency is flowing there, this quarter and what’s the sales activity in those units? Are you still shipping those types of unit to PDCs?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes, I mean I would tell you our manufacturing, its not just manufacturing, our project execution is sort of night and day from it was 12 months ago, I think how many grey hairs I had 12 months ago, now they turn back to black, no I’m just kidding, but we had three major projects that were significant-significant problems last year.</p>
<p>From a manufacturing perspective, it start within price such with the resources our Chief Operating Officer will be on board in Q3 of last year, Bill Miller and his team have implemented leaning manufacturing for the first time in the operations, they’ve significantly improved to the flow, they’ve got a whole bunch more tools in place that brought out by the finance team and manufacturing. And we’ve much more well oil machine, I get excited when we do factor acceptance tests and one of the largest pipeline operators in the country comes and says, this is the best factory acceptance I’ve seen in 30 years in his carrier. That means what we’re doing in the factory as working very-very well.</p>
<p>Which is important, because the second half of your question is what the sales of our business that are in this PDC almost a 100%. If you go to Beaumont right now, you’re going to say the plant is literally full with PDC is 70 foot long, 80 foot long, 30 foot long, 50 foot long. I don’t know what the percentage could we break it out that way, but I would tell you just the project that I know of 85%, 90% of our products business is all going into a PDC. So that was, again this is part of this the move that we may last year to build upon or expand the plan and get in the PDC business with this [indiscernible], that’s the stuff that we’re booking now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>Could you repeat again, you said it early in the comments maybe Andy you said. What was the dividend again this quarter BOMAY and MIEFE?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. In total it is about 1.2 million, about a million of that BOMAY and rest of MIEFE.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Greg Ayers</span></strong></p>
<p>So 1.0 from BOMAY and 0.2 from MIEFE, it would be good. And I guess my last question is do you have any estimate of when you would be filing the 10-Q?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>Today.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Next we’ll move to George [indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Congratulations, it looks like one of the toughest environments, we’re making good progress. I’ve got one question you filed a shelf offering for your company stock. In terms of when that would be executed? Would that have to do with you receiving and leading some of those large or contract and/or with this going back with maybe possible acquisition opportunities that we are discussed over the last couple of years?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Good question George. So no, I think, the thing for the shelf, what I liked about the shelf is that, it basically gives us flexibility. We filed the shelf and it’s available for us to pull down whenever we can get. So when would we think about needing it, it basically being deteriorate that you identify which is for working capital as we go get if we need these larger projects. And also because we are balanced between the upstream, midstream and downstream oil and gas markets, there are opportunities for us from accretive M&amp;A perspective. First to go pick up some interesting companies along the way, I hate to tell this, but if we look out my window in Houston, this company that are significantly worse financial position and we are right now. And so that’s, it’s a little bit of potential opportunity for Worchester and making sure that we can deliver on the growth, we’re trying to do and also be opportunistic on the acquisitions if they come up their strategic and accretive.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>The upcoming first expert of liquefied natural gas, I guess the first one will be this being past and there is some relation is coming up in Christie. Is that in an area that you are possibly could get working?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>So we’ve, we can’t talk about comments and I never could hurt what I put it, so I’m glad be brought of that. We’ve actually booked and shift to L&amp;G project so far this year and one was a micro LNG plant and one was one of the rare pieces that we had a small line switch when to another LNG plant. So we like the L&amp;G market, our products well there, the customers that we’re working with same interest. The things like there has been past those are gigantic projects and we’re probably not fully at that level, we can pursue $50 million project at this point, what we’re looking for is the right size projects that the customers can give us, so we can successfully execute over a reasonable period of time, we are probably even we would love to take on $50 million project and I’m sure that the customers would give us a $50 million project at this stage of the company. So think, to your point, we like the L&amp;G market, we’re start doing work in the L&amp;G market, we’ve got some good customer proof points there and are continuing to pursue those, the medium size L&amp;G projects as they come forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And the prime contract I think in these project, it seems to be you wouldn’t be like backed oil corporation, you wouldn’t be like a sub to those guys or other companies you and they go indirect?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>No, no, no for this L&amp;G projects it all goes through back or a floor or Jacobs, or KBR or people like that and by the way that's part of the thing that I’m excited about is if you remember a year or so ago we hired a senior sales manager just for these large EPS funds and he has walking his way through and we’re starting to book orders for the first time with the floors of the world and I’m looking forward to buy those more of those in progress, again these are all for us essentially brand new brick and accounts all upside over the current business levels that we are penetrating, and those are that all market share gain versus the majors who have been selling to these guys for 20 years.</p>
<p>Yes, they like what they hear from us when they come to see, they like what they see and we get involve.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Great question in the offshore oil and gas industry, is there any work for you guys to be done when companies [indiscernible] ships in the coming months or what is your expectation on the sort of general on the offshore drilling market, I saw that Pemex has its first auction of some new areas to be drilled for the first time, I guess in the 30 years and there is a couple of more coming up this year? Where you see the offshore industry in that in general?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andy Puhala</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so couple of things, I just back from Brazil and I was also in Singapore and China in the last month. The new builds for offshore in Southeast Asia are basically non-existent, they are working of a backlog still, but there is not very many new offshore drilling or offshore production projects going on in Asia, or literally for the Gulf of Mexico very-very few, first we’re attracting the ones that are there. There still maybe opportunities in China for some offshore drilling but in general, it’s really quite.</p>
<p>So in terms of service opportunities we do see service opportunities as the existing rig need to be maintained and depending on how they stack, it is a cold stack or is it warm stack are the particular service opportunities.</p>
<p>That not necessarily been in area that outside of Brazil we’ve been able to focus on, so I’m not convince that those opportunities those are a lot that's been done by the internal maintenance, maybe some opportunities in Brazil about where we’ve had some opportunities we’ve seen.</p>
<p>In terms of Pemex in Mexico, we’ve actually hired a new drilling segments manager which significant experience on the ground in Mexico and so we think that there is opportunities in Mexico not just for offshore drilling, but for all aspects of the oil and gas chain, in terms of we’ve done a tone of business with American companies who shipped products to Mexico for both offshore, offshore production, land drilling, power generation, land production, lots of business we’ve been booked in the U.S., per US customers and shipped in that area, so we’ve a lot of experience but we didn’t have who somebody to lead the business development efforts, which we now do. So we’re interested in Mexico, the first auction I think they did for some shallow water, but that did not go that well but the deepwater this is I think coming up is expected actually resulting some real cash to Pemex in the Mexico.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me bring one last question, the last couple of days you had Renminbi has been devalued, is that working for against us?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>It worst against us little bit George, as I mentioned in my comments at this point we don't think it's a material, going to have a material impact on us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. You mentioned that the BOMAY does quite a bit of export so it should help to BOMAY export oriented of oil?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks very much and we’ll be looking forward to some further good quarterly reports.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Dauber</span></strong></p>
<p>Sounds great. Thanks George.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
