<p>I will now turn the call over to Mark L. Baum, Chief Executive Officer of Imprimis Pharmaceuticals. Mark?</p>
<p><strong>Mark L. Baum</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for joining us. Today I will provide an update of what we accomplished in the second quarter, adding in some recent developments, and touch on our goals for the remainder of the year. Then turn the call over to our Chief Financial Officer, Andrew Boll, to review the quarterly financials. Following Andrew’s review of the financial data, I will make some final remarks and open the call to questions.</p>
<p>Let me first state that at this stage of our development I am pleased with our $2 million in revenues for the quarter. This was a 195% increase over the second quarter of last year. But while I am happy with the reported growth, I can tell you at the real top line and bottom line growth opportunities are ahead of us. Fortunately we make things that hundreds and hundreds of our customers want to buy. And as a fast growing company we are gearing up to meet that demand. In this regard we recently acquired our third compounding pharmacy in Texas which created additional production redundancy and expanded our dispensing capabilities to an aggregate of 45 states, which includes the top five most popular states in the United States.</p>
<p>This morning we announced that we signed an international licensing agreement to expand our Dropless Therapy and LessDrops combination drop formulations in to Canada. This represents a significant opportunity with over 1200 ophthalmic surgeons performing an estimated 250,000 cataract procedures annually in Canada. Our licensee expects the Canadian public payers will provide for payment for our compounded formulation and our contracted per unit royalty rate is at greater up $50 per unit or 20% of gross sales. We are building a state of the art 503B outsourcing facility in New Jersey that once open should enable us to ship our key drug formulation interstate and without a patient specific prescription. We have been methodical and detailed with our design process taking into a consideration the most recent FDA guidance for outsourcing facilities in compounding pharmacies. </p>
<p>We expect to invest approximately $3 million in this state of the art facility including equipment, systems, facility improvements, and other processes. We expect construction to be completed at the end of the fourth quarter. Following the construction of this facility we will begin validating our formulas and processes and expect to begin dispensing formulations towards the end of the first quarter next year. We believe our outsourcing facility in New Jersey when open will further accelerate our growth. </p>
<p>Now I will describe our business, specific drug formulations, and the therapeutic areas we serve. It has never been more expensive or risky to gain FDA approval for a drug. Our disrupted business model allows for novel compounded drugs to be brought to market in a capital efficient and expeditious way. We do this by using well characterized FDA approved generic drugs and repurposing them as a new proprietary compounded drug formulation. </p>
<p>In effect we take off patent generic drugs and use them in new ways to solve unmet medical needs while at the same time creating new patented or patentable drug formulations. We’re focused on the ophthalmology and urology markets and within these markets, we own a diversified and growing portfolio of patented and patent pending compounded drug formulations. </p>
<p>We make and dispense these formulations to physicians, patients, hospitals, and ambulatory surgery centers, or ASCs according to a physician’s prescription for an individual patient. We’re currently licensed to operate in 45 states and dispense our formulations from three compounding centers located in New Jersey, California, and now Texas. </p>
<p>Within the ophthalmology market we own a core patent pending technology called SSP Technology. It allows us to combine multiple active pharmaceutical ingredients into one medicine. SSP Technology allows us to make injectable formulations as well as topical formulations like eye drops. Further our SSP Technology allows us to tune the particle size of our formulations depending on the application. We can make particle sizes larger for certain injectable drug formulations or smaller for topical applications. </p>
<p>Our goal in ophthalmology and with our SSP Technology is to disrupt the incumbent billion dollar plus topical eye drop market. We are doing this by giving physicians and their patients completely new prescription options that were previously unavailable. One example is our proprietary Dropless Therapy injectable formulations. </p>
<p>Dropless Therapy including Tri-Moxi and Tri-Moxi-Venc is now being used by hundreds of ophthalmologists in the United States in tens of thousands of cataract surgeries. Physicians have consistently reported at leading ophthalmology meetings in the United States that the use of Dropless Therapy formulations has dramatically reduced and in most cases eliminated the need for patients to buy expensive eye drops and then apply them hundreds of times after cataract surgery. We believe Dropless Therapy is the future of cataract surgery and our goal is to serve majority of the estimated 4 million cataract patients who will undergo this procedure annually within the next few years. </p>
<p>This quarter we set a record for Dropless Therapy sales, growing from 14,800 units in the first quarter of this year to over 23,000 units in the second quarter of this year. And this represents an over 60% sequential or quarter-over-quarter revenue growth and over 900% growth compared to the same quarter last year. </p>
<p>Although in July we experienced some expected seasonality in our cataract surgery business, we expect our positive market share capture trend to continue and possibly accelerate. We believe our market share is likely to accelerate significantly if physicians are able to pass some or all of the cost of Dropless Therapy to their patients or to Medicare. We continue to work with well known consulting groups regarding various CMS strategies. </p>
<p>We will continue to execute our strategy by demonstrating the potential patient benefits of this therapy and its potential significant economic benefit to the Medicare system. For more information about Dropless surgery and Go Dropless educational campaign visit <a href="http://www.dropless.com" rel="nofollow"><u>www.dropless.com</u></a>. Another example how we are disrupting topical eye drop market with our SSP Technology is through our proprietary eye drop formulations. </p>
<p>During the second quarter of this year we introduced our LessDrops educational campaign along with our proprietary combination of topical eye drop formulations which uniquely offer various combinations of steroids, antibiotics, and NSAIDs in a single eye drop bottle. The idea was LessDrops is simple. Why buy and apply three bottles of eye drops when you could use one. </p>
<p>Further given the cost of our competitor's single active drug eye drops, why spend hundreds of dollars when you could spend as little as $60. We believe that saving money and reducing by up to 50% or more, the number of times that one applies eye drops into their eyes is a compelling offering. And our theory is being proven in the market. LessDrops sales are growing rapidly. </p>
<p>Second quarter 2015 sales from our combination topical eye drop formulations totaled $96,000. Sales momentum for these compounded topical eye drop formulation though has continued and we expect to more than triple the Q2 revenue announcement in our third quarter of this year. We are pleased that the acceptance of these formulations in the market and we are working hard to keep up with demand. Please learn more about our LessDrops educational campaign by visiting www.lessdrops.com. </p>
<p>Beyond our SSP Technology we recently acquired the rights to a new formulation which we believe maybe prescribed for conscious sedation of patients undergoing ophthalmic surgery and other surgical procedures. This patent pending compounded drug is a – and acts like a soft dissolving lozenges now. The premise of this formulation is that by eliminating the need to administer an IV prior to surgery may be able to lower the cost of sedating a cataract surgery patient and ease patient anxiety associated with getting an IV. </p>
<p>Importantly the inventor of our formulation has successfully used a very similar formulation in his surgical practice more than a thousand times. In order to validate the sizable opportunity, a team of ophthalmic surgeons is conducting a patient specific clinical evaluation so that if successful we may add it to our ophthalmology offerings, perhaps during the fall of this year. </p>
<p>In ophthalmology we currently have one national Business Director – Regional Business Director and one inside sales person. We plan to add an additional one more regional business director by the end of the year as we continue to add licenses for the remaining states and open our outsourcing facility. </p>
<p>Before I discuss our new urology business, let me add that our sales strategy across all therapeutic areas is a land and expand strategy. We land by building relationships with physicians by offering them unique proprietary compounded drug formulations that they cannot get anywhere. To solve real pain points in their practice handling the lives of their patients. </p>
<p>Once relationship with a physician, hospital or ASC are built the expand part of our land and expand strategy is achieved by offering non-proprietary compounded formulations and other prescription drug products. This is the key initiative for 2015, that will continue to expand throughout the year and beyond as we begin to formalize relationships with hospitals and leading ASC groups. </p>
<p>During our last quarterly call we had just launched our urology business. The cornerstone of our urology business is our patented compounded drug formulation that we refer to as HLA. In late April of this year we gained the exclusive license rights to HLA which is a Heparin and alkanized Lidocaine compounded formulation that physicians have used extensively for many years to treat patients suffering from interstitial cystitis or IC which is a potentially devastating condition of the bladder. HLA is instilled directly into the bladder and patients have reported seeing relief from their IC symptoms within 30 minutes of administration. </p>
<p>According to the AUA guidelines, bladder insulations are listed as the second line treatment option when treatment such as diet modification, stress management, and over the counter products do not work or they take too much time to provide relief. We believe the market for this formulation could exceed $4 billion per year which is by far the largest market opportunity we have at Imprimis. </p>
<p>We began to market and dispense HLA towards the end of the second quarter of this year, and here is what we have learned so far. We recorded nearly $165,000 in revenue during the second quarter, and $50,000 in royalty revenues from legacy sub-licensees. The royalty revenues represented payments of over 2400 doses that were dispensed from April 24 to June 30. We have now transferred all of the legacy prescriptions and refills for HLA to our pharmacies and we do not expect additional royalty revenues except for nominal amounts that continue into the future. During this time frame, we converted 26 IC specialist physicians to our platform.</p>
<p>Here is some important metrics related to the IC business. Because IC is a chronic disease when a physician prescribes compounded HLA generally the physician is making the initial prescription for the patient and will write for 11 monthly refills. Therefore, once the initial prescription is filled at one of our compounding centers and when requested by the patients, we have the ability to fill the remaining refill amounts as prescribed by the physician. The exciting opportunity is that beyond our monthly acquisition of new HLA patients, we have the potential to significantly grow each month through refills of our existing prescription base. Refills have the potential to act as a growing future reservoir of revenues as patients seek to refill their HLA prescriptions. </p>
<p>Another important metric is the average monthly prescription value per patient. This value for our second quarter was $1643 per patient per month. The value is calculated based on the actual average of existing paid and pending prescriptions per patient on a monthly basis. Going forward we expect the sales from our HLA compounded formulations will be a big driver of revenue growth especially in the third and fourth quarters of this year. </p>
<p>We have been building out our urology sales team and currently have one national Business Director and six Regional Business Directors. This is a cohesive group of passionate people who have extensive urology and pharmaceutical experience. We will be attending two important upcoming urology meetings that will be taking place in the fall and includes the American Urogynecological Society annual meeting in Seattle, Washington and the Pelvic Pain Society meeting here in our home town of San Diego. </p>
<p>Our marketing efforts for HLA formulations are different than our current approach in ophthalmology which has been primarily focused on physician outreach. Although our Regional Business Directors are calling on physicians to educate them about our HLA formulations, we have also begun to launch various marketing campaigns focused on IC patients such as our Defeat IC Education website, several social media communities, direct email campaigns and partnerships with IC advocacy groups. We believe this two pronged approach will increase demand within the patient population and our physician efforts will garner interest in the medical community. </p>
<p>The Defeat IC has actually become an active online forum for IC and the members of our social sites are very responsive and engaged. Our Facebook page already has 700 followers and on Twitter we have over 350 followers. Members of these online communities discuss ideas on how to best cope with their IC and they share exercises, food restrictions, and recipes. Our other discussions revolve around providing support and encouragement. I would like to share some recent patient posts on Facebook about Imprimis, Defeat IC, and HLA. </p>
<p>One patient just said simply this works when discussing our HLA formulation. Another, I want to say thank you to Defeat IC for joining in and spreading awareness about IC and sharing hope. It means the world to us ICers [ph] so thank you. Another, thank you Defeat IC, you have been a great help and comfort to me personally. I am sure there are others out there benefiting from all you do for us, so thank you. </p>
<p>On Twitter we posted a question to followers asking who would you like to thank for your continued support of your chronic illness. A follower responded, Dr. Robert Evans for taking care of my daughters patient care. Also you Imprimis, you have been good support to IC patients too. </p>
<p>We also recently started Defeat IC communities on Instagram and Pinterest that has been such a gratifying experience to see these Defeat IC communities really blossom over the last few months. To learn more, visit defeatic.com and join one or all of the Defeat IC communities. </p>
<p>Our second key formulation within our urology business is alkalized or freeze dried version of what has always been marketed is Tri-Mix. We call our formulation Tri-Mix-L because it’s alkalized. Regular Tri-Mix has been used for decades to treat men dealing with erectile dysfunction. Unlike our competitors our formulations which we launched in the middle part of the last quarter are dispensed in single dose vials and maybe stored at room temperature allowing for easy transportation and storage. </p>
<p>So far we have received very positive responses from physicians and patients using our formulation and we are looking forward to seeing this business continue to grow and ED market is significant up to 30 million American men suffer from ED and an estimated 600,000 are diagnosed annually. According to the AUA intracavernous vasoactive injections such as our Tri-Mix L formulations are considered the most effective treatment for ED. To learn more once again visit www.EDfree.com </p>
<p>Our third business is our integrative RX therapies business. Through our acquisition of Park Compounding in early 2015, we have begun to market a portfolio of non-proprietary compounded formulations consisting of sterile injectable integrative medicine therapies that are used in various therapeutic areas including oncology, autoimmunity, chronic infectious diseases, and endocrine and metabolic diseases. </p>
<p>Many of these formulations which we refer to as integrative therapy are offered in various formats, for example in suspension or lyophilized. We believe they provide differentiated and beneficial factors as compared to some of our competitors. As part of our initiative in integrative therapies we have to command a series of regional conferences related to furthering education and awareness of our formulation options within the integrative medical community. </p>
<p>The first conference focused on autoimmunity and integrative medicines took place in Seattle last month. We plan to establish this business under our ImprimisRx umbrella and we will be adding a small sales and marketing team to develop educational campaigns focused on these new therapeutic areas. I will now hand the call over to Andrew Boll, our CFO.</p>
<p><strong>Andrew R. Boll</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Mark, hi everyone, thank you for joining our call. I will run through the second quarter 2015 financial results and provide a brief outlook for the remainder of the year. As we mentioned at the beginning of the call, total revenues for the second quarter were approximately $2 million. Our Q2 2015 revenue was nearly triple the total revenues recorded during the second quarter of 2014. </p>
<p>Total cost for sales for the second quarter in 2015 was just under 1.1 million yielding a gross profit of approximately $900,000 compared to a gross profit of about 200,000 last year. Operating expenses totaled $4.4 million yielding a net loss of 3.7 million for the quarter compared to the second quarter last year which we reported operating expenses of 2.8 million and a net loss of $2.6 million. Backing out certain expenses and income line items we recorded an adjusted EBITDA loss of approximately 2.6 million for the second quarter of 2015 compared to 2 million for the second quarter of last year. </p>
<p>As Mark discussed there is a significant an increase in sales of our Dropless Therapy formulations this quarter. Since the launch of our Go Dropless educational campaign in April 2014, our Tri-Moxi and Tri-Moxi-Vanc compounded formulations have been used in estimated 70,000 eye surgeries, primarily cataract surgeries. Additionally in later April we gained exclusive rights to our HLA formulation and completed the transfer of existing HLA refill prescriptions to our pharmacies. </p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2015, we saw our gross margins increase to nearly 47% as we continued to implement efficiency measures at our compounding centers, increased sales of our proprietary compound formulations, and recorded royalty revenues. While we expect our gross margins to increase, we also expect our operating expenses will increase slightly in the future as we add personnel to enhance our client services and pharmacy operations departments to support expected demand to make additional investments in our sales and marketing efforts. </p>
<p>At June 30, 2015 our balance sheet had about $10 million in cash and cash equivalents and we currently have about 9.6 million shares of common stock outstanding. During the second quarter the company received about $1.2 million in net proceeds from more in exercises. We also announced $15 million term loan agreement with an affiliate of Life Sciences alternative funding LLC which provides us with $10 million in gross proceeds at closing and they provide us with an additional 5 million in proceeds. </p>
<p>We are continuing to grow our business and we expect to report $12 million to $13.5 million in total revenues for the year ending December 31, 2015. We expect a growth in revenues to be primarily driven by sales of our HLA compounded formulation as we expand on that existing business and supported by the continuing sales growth of our proprietary ophthalmic formulations. I will now hand the call back to Mark. </p>
<p><strong>Mark L. Baum</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Andrew and I am proud of our team's dedication and their significant accomplishments in the second quarter. I am confident that the investments we have made in our business to date has positioned us to continue to grow and generate stockholder value. If you are a shareholder, a prescribing physician, or one of the thousands of patients that we have served this quarter, I want to personally thank you for your trust. At this time I will open up the call for questions from our participants. </p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from Matt Hewitt from Craig-Hallum.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Hewitt</span></strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon gentlemen, congratulations on your progress and thank you for taking our questions. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you Matt </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Hewitt</span></strong></p>
<p>First on HLA, obviously a lot of success there and getting all the doctors converted as quickly as you did, I am curious if you kind of have gotten a better sense for that. There is script volume and getting new patients on HLA, are you anticipating that you will be able to ramp to that $5 million to $5.5 million that the prior -- that was the prior amount?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we would be -- the question is of course timing. If you are seeing what we ramped to that amount, I think even with the guidance that we laid out we expect to far exceed that run rate with that product because a significant portion of the guidance is connected to HLA sales. So, we not only expect to get to that run rate but to far exceed it certainly before the end of this year. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Hewitt</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, and I apologize I should have put it out little differently but you are absolutely right. Okay, secondly can you provide an update on the 503 facility, 503B facility but what has been the tone of the discussions with the FDA, what are you hearing back from them, are you finding that the process has gotten a little bit easier than may be you had feared or has there been robust thrown in the way there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew R. Boll</span></strong></p>
<p>We are not communicating directly with the FDA. We see the guidance that comes out. In fact there was a guidance that just came out here I believe yesterday and today from the FDA concerning 503B outsourcing facilities. So, we have looked at the draft guidance and some of these more final guidance and what we have learned from those guidance is actually constructive, the way that we have built the facility. There are still open questions concerning what you can make in these facilities but I do know a number of owners of these types of facilities and I understand what they are making in those facilities now and they are all registered with the FDA and they have been inspected with the FDA. And we need to make similar sales compounded products out of our 503B facilities. </p>
<p>So, we have hope that we will be able to make our key ophthalmic formulations as well as our urologic formulations out of that facility. At the same time the second part of this is what policy makers are seeing and I have had the opportunity over the last quarter to talk to policy makers and these are legislators, these are members of Congress and I believe that they are very excited about 503B outsourcing facilities and I think that the folks that I’ve talked to want to see an open approach to what you can make in these types of facilities. Of course they are leading it up to the FDA to make those final calls but by and large I think policy makers are excited about the opportunities that these outsourcing facilities will offer. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Hewitt</span></strong></p>
<p>Okaym great. Thank you, maybe two more and then I’ll hop back in the queue. The first one, the AVN, could you provide an update on where you sit with that, have you had additional discussions, is that something I would assume that hopefully you can get an AVN but where does that sit today?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Well the reason why we are talking to policy makers is because we are talking about Dropless cataract surgery. We are talking about the value that it brings to the market and what we continue to talk about as I said is value to the patients. Potential value that Dropless Therapy offers and I think from the policy makers standpoint, from the members standpoint they want to know something about cost and then they will see the numbers because I think by and large when members talk to physicians and they talk to patients and they see the value and the benefits of our therapy. That excites them. That’s easy for us to demonstrate but they also want to see the numbers and they’ve asked for the data. They want to know how much is it to save CMS, is it going to truly save over a billion dollars and so we are getting them the information they’ve asked us for and we believe that till you provide them with the information they will be able to hopefully create a thing – more beneficial for us and hopefully that will include having the AVN. So we are still on course, we are working very hard and getting lot of across country frequent flier miles in introducing the -– we have hope that we are going to be successful within AVN in due course. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Hewitt</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. One last ne from me, and I am sorry if I missed this in the press release but you are moving to Canada, it sounds like there is reimbursement already in place but what is that amount and is there any opportunities as you start to penetrate that market, will there be opportunities on price where you could encourage the Canadian authorities to increase the reimbursement of given the reduced cost that they are ultimately facing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>You know it’s really interesting and thank you for that. In prior calls we kind of really -- we are focusing on the U.S. market but when we go to these conferences especially in the United States, the leading eye meetings we meet doctors from Canada, we meet doctors from United Kingdom, France and Germany. Doctors from all over the world that want access to Dropless Therapy. </p>
<p>Canada was a striking example because the opportunity there was unique because believe it or not, our partner believes and we expect that either the national system, the federal system or the provincial healthcare systems will pay for Dropless Therapy as well as our combination eye drop product. So it’s odd that in Canada having me believe there more favorable reception for our formulations in terms of getting paid than we have been able to receive here in the United States. So the opportunity there is fairly significant. Just in the cataract side there is more than a quarter of a million procedures. </p>
<p>If you think about the overall market and the overall market for not only injectables but topical applications as well, potentially let’s say even a million potential sales opportunities for every 2% of that market that we are able to capture. For every 2% of the market or for every 20,000 units that we sell we would receive a minimum a million dollars in net income through this royalty. </p>
<p>So, it could be a potentially lucrative opportunity for us if you think about capturing even 10% of that market with unique products and we are hopeful that our partner can get there in time. But this is a royalty opportunity in one market North America. We had other folks approach us outside of these in Canada but we are excited about this market and we are excited about our partner. We went out there and visited with them. They have a real strong foothold particularly in the Eastern part of the Canada. So hopefully by the fourth quarter we’ll start to report some revenue from this arrangement and then next year we really kick in. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Hewitt</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s great. Congratulations on the progress. Thank you. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Peter Kimplish [ph] from [indiscernible] Investor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Hey Mark, first time on the call here, congratulations on the incredible progress over the last 18 months of just having watched being a shareholder for a while and just its remarkable the steps that you guys are taking. A number of my questions have been answered, my one question in Canada would be, are there opportunities on the urology side and what would be the roadblocks or you know it looks like it’s just on the ophthalmology side right now so If there is anything from a growth perspective on urology side. And I will be back in the queue?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you Peter we appreciate your presence as a shareholder. The license that we have from Urogen who is the holder of the IP risk sublicense fee is just for the U.S. market only. So unfortunately we can’t go into Canada, we can’t go outside of the United States with our license and that’s unfortunate. </p>
<p>What we were able to do with our partner in Canada is really kind of focusing on this ophthalmology business initially. And I hope that the license which includes an initial cash payment and it does have certain diligence requirements and a fairly nice royalty for us just relates to the ophthalmology business and we are going to start there with this partner, it is a non-exclusive license at this point, could become an exclusive license but what we like to do is develop a relationship with our partner and see that grow and develop. </p>
<p>We do have other formulations within urology that we are working on and I have said this over the last few years when we started with Dropless, is that hey, they are the things that we talk about and there were the things that we continue to develop kind of behind the curtain. Well within our ophthalmology portfolio in our urology portfolio we still have other things that we are working on that have not been made public. And so our hope is that is this relationship in Canada develops we will be able to continue to add to the portfolio of products that are a part of this license agreement with the advance dosage partner. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thank you. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you Peter.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. And we do have a question coming from the line of Jack Fraser from Seamark Capital.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jack Fraser</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey Mark, congrats on the progress and thanks for taking the question. I am wondering if you would just share with us a little update on how the economic model is evolving and give us a sense without the intend on number, a neighborhood or ballpark of revenue run rate that would appear to equate to cash flow breakeven based on what we knew about the gross margin performance that doesn’t because it’s obviously doing pretty well? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you Jack, the question relates to where we are with the growth and when we will get to breakeven. You know, we looked in as we decided to do when this call was to kind of give some guidance or a range of guidance from $12 million $13.5 million and so if you think about those numbers and you think about some of the other things that I’ve said in terms of our growth in let’s say the third quarter. The reality is that as we get into the fourth quarter we are going to have to essentially probably double what we do in the third quarter. So when we tell that to our folks, the pharmacy we tell them they are within basically three months they are going to have double the number of units that they produce and ship. It is very, very fast growth but that’s what we plan on to do Jack we’re planning to grow this business dramatically particularly in the third and the fourth quarter primarily on the back of our HLA formulation.</p>
<p>So if you think about for example number a little bit north of $6 million to hit the guidance that we are at. When you think about the growth that we expect when we open up our 503B facility and start shipping from there which I said will further accelerate our growth as we get into the first quarter of 2016. And we model that out 12 months, you see that you have got a business on a pro forma basis without any further growth. It is probably in the $25 million range. </p>
<p>And if you take the gross margins that we reported this quarter right among 50% and you think about what it cost us to operate our business you can probably see that right around in that time frame it is possible for us to be at a neutral point I terms of our burn. But that’s particularly exciting. I think the growth is really going to come from our ability to move the HLA formulation continue to have success with it. By the way none of that growth really anticipates a change in CMS policy with respect to our Dropless formulation. So to the extent that we have success there, we as I said in my remarks I believe our growth in the injectable business would significantly improve in terms of growth and then hopefully in terms of pricing as well. </p>
<p>So there are a number of ways that we could exceed what we’ve laid out of course there is a lot of work to do lot of things that we have to hurdle but we are very hopeful that we will be able to manage this growth. These are all sort of good problems to have when you are growing this fast. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jack Fraser</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure thanks very much Mark, appreciate that. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you Jack. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from John Grimley from TJW Financial.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey Mark, congrats on progress. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you John. I am waiting for you to say Happy Birthday.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>Happy Birthday and congrats on the progress. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks a lot. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>I guess that’s good planning or not so good planning, I mean the earnings call on your Birthday. But I guess when you have to talk let’s talk about that’s good. So can you just -- I’d like to understand better the Dropless is clearly how that story started but its turning into much more than that from my perspective at least what percentage of your doctors that are ordering Dropless and to what extent have you been able to use that Dropless as almost a Trojan horse to get strong relationships with the doctors? What percentage of those doctors now are starting to order the drops as well from you?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Every one of our drop customers is a Dropless customer, so it’s working you know the learn and expand strategy is real I think you can start to see that in the numbers actually because even though we’ve kind assumed out the breadth of product that we sell that are non sort of Dropless LessDrops or core urology formulations. If you look at the line for what we call other revenues for the quarter, it’s a significant amount those revenues come from than expand part of the land and expand strategy so we are able to get in there with Dropless we are able to get in there and so we with LessDrops rather we are able to get in there and so from these other high margin non-proprietary products as well. But it all starts with getting in the door with the relationship and that happens by having an amazing product like a Dropless formulation. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>And just I think have these numbers somewhere, how big is the Dropless, I am sorry I know Dropless how big is the drops opportunity. I mean it’s mostly done for Lasik right that primary end use for the drops?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew R. Boll</span></strong></p>
<p>Drops, our drops are being used by physicians for a number of different procedures, outside and certainly Lasik but for a number of other types of procedures. In patients that we talk to customers, patients that come in with inflammation or infection are using these drops for them. So we are frankly pleased but surprised with the uptake in the market and we’ve been working really hard to build up our safety stocks in our bill two levels for these drop formulations. So it’s been really terrific and that inference in my remarks is certainly an area where there is much more upside than I think even we laid out as things continue. </p>
<p>We have actually pulled back a little bit in terms of our marketing of our drop formulation so that we can get our facilities up for the build two in safety stock levels because the demand has been pretty good. The nice thing is as we are getting a fairly premium price. So we’re selling a 6 ml bottle of these drops for $60 which is a tremendous value for the patient by the way. But it is a business that didn’t exist a few months ago that is going to generate we think a tremendous amount of value going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>And how much are those drops compared to what you would get from one of your large competitors, how much is your discount roughly? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>I bought, I purchased three drops, 2 branded and one generic. These were NSAID and what we mentioned is specific brands they are the big guys. Then said a steroid in a antibiotic and I paid $421 for those three drops, and we sell triamcinolone moxifloxacin ketorolac as a combination in a 60 ml for $60. So $421 at CVS in DElmore California versus $60 that’s a tremendous cost savings. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it okay and I won’t go there I am sure it pumped in. As you I do continue to grow that business a lot of an impact from some of your bigger competitors. And then I am pretty up to speed on what you guys are doing as far as trying to get better reimbursement for Dropless or summary investment or can you just kind of say as much as you can there and kind of flush that out on what you are doing and what the opportunity could mean for your business if you are able to get, if you are able to figure out that bottleneck?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew R. Boll</span></strong></p>
<p>I think you can two things as I said first of all what we are doing is we are talking to the folks to make a decision. We are talking to them and their staff. So these are typically elected members of congress and we are talking directly to them and we are communicating our story public in demographs. And when we talked to them and when they talked to physicians, they talked to patients I don’t think that as I said earlier that there was a debate as to the value of the technology, the value to the patient. CMS is under pressure we believe to save money. And members want to know about potential cost savings. And I can walk in there and show them a receipt from CVS for $421 for eye drops and tell them that our formulation could cost 75% less than that but they want to see economic studies. They want to see real data from reputable sources and so we are getting them exactly what they’ve asked for and it will be available soon hopefully. And hopefully it will be made public and I think policy makers will have to make those decisions. </p>
<p>The same debate is going on if you Google Avastin which is a repackaged Genentech product that is used off label in the ophthalmology world, the political pressure that was applied to continue to allow back at the eye doctors, retina guys to continue to buy compounded or repackaged Avastin was real and part of that, most of the pressure was applied due to the massive cost savings. Billions and billions of dollars a year in cost savings that were available to CMS by allowing for compounded or repackaged Avastin as opposed to using the FDA approved products for the same indication. Come out in the FDA approved products but they are easy to find. </p>
<p>So we think that we are following the same sort of strategy. We are talking about clinical outcomes, their physicians report, and we are going to really really put an exclamation point on the potential cost savings to the policymakers in CMS care about saving money at this stage of the game.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that’s really helpful and if I think of anything else I’ll just… I really appreciate it and happy birthday man, do something.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you John. And I do want to say, if we are successful with the AVN, I think it was the second part of your question, what is going to happen to the business. I think two things will happen and I don’t think I am going out on a limb too far by saying this but I believe our market share is going to ramp significantly and I believe the price that we are able to garner for each dose is going to go up significantly. So, two really good things for our business. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, sorry, just a follow-up on that, the guidance you have given us assumes no AVN, correct, I just want to make sure that -- I guess what I am thinking about this is it is all upside if you get the AVN?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>Most certainly and we are not in control of that and we are -- we do control our own destiny, we can see HLA. We pretty much understand all of those factors and we are building up the business to drive that. But if we are able to get the AVN or figure out a way to get Dropless covered or otherwise paying for it at a better rate that is real upside. That is not part of what we discussed. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it and then last, at least they know it is not your -- anything in your control but if you had to put kind of a window around when you might get more information on when shareholders might know where. If we are able to get any of the answers is that something that could happen in the back half of the year or is it. I guess, best case scenario and kind of longer-term with the window we should be thinking about that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t want you to be disappointed. I can only tell you I am working really hard on this. We are working with the smartest and most experienced people in the United States on this issue. We are really, really hopefully close to having some good information that these folks have asked us for and we can't predict whether that is going to drive policy shift immediately or whether that is going to take six months or a year. </p>
<p>We do think though that we are going to build a case that is really compelling. I think when we think about what is going to drive things in the short term, the ability to grow our HLA business is certainly tremendous and what is really exciting is I use this metaphor of a reservoir of potential value and I think that is something we are certainly focusing on because right now all of our revenues are coming in from new HLA prescriptions and as the business matures and it just got started. But as the business matures, we are going to see more and more of our monthly revenues for HLA not come from new prescriptions. I mean that will still drive new prescriptions but more importantly that revenue will come from refills of legacy prescriptions. So it kind of creates this really wonderful potential annuity for our business every month as we resell this chronic care prescription. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Grimley</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it, okay. Great, that is really helpful. And again congrats on the progress and appreciate your answering the questions?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark L. Baum</span></strong></p>
