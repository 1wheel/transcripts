<p><strong>Craig Nieboer</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone and thanks for attending the call today. Before we start, I would like to note that in our commentary today, there will be forward-looking financial information and that our actual results may differ materially from the expected results due to a various risk factors and assumptions. These risk factors and assumptions are summarized in our Q2 MD&amp;A, our Q2 press release and in our Annual Information Form dated March 12, 2015. In addition, certain financial measures that we will refer to today are not recognized under current generally accepted accounting policies. And for a description and definition of these, please refer to our second quarter MD&amp;A.</p>
<p>At this time, I will turn it over to Tom, our President and CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Simons</strong></p>
<p>Good morning. Thank you for calling in. This morning, we are going to provide an operations update. We will provide an update on the status of our expansion infrastructure that we are working on. We are going to remind listeners of our strategy to take the company through low commodity prices. We will provide our outlook for the near-term. And then we are also going to speak to our longer term strategy for growing our business.</p>
<p>I will start operationally with Canadian drilling fluids. Extremely quiet in Q2 in Canada, of course, that’s typical in Q2 in Canada as the frost comes out of the ground and greatly exacerbated by commodity prices, so not any type of financial contribution necessarily to the company. We did retain our people. We trained them. We certainly rationalized headcount earlier in Q2. Today, we are on 68 drilling fluid jobs in Western Canada. People should know that with this second collapse of oil prices, it is a very price sensitive market. Almost every job is treated as a new bid. So, you need to be on your game. You need to provide excellence at the rig and you need to be very sharp on price. We expect through the near-term to hold our own in Canada, so somewhere around a third of the market. We continue to believe that unique technology, superior service and being very competitive on price is what’s going to allow us to hold the book of business that we have spent the last 15 years building. We expect Canada as an industry, probably not to exceed 200 rigs very much, if at all, until commodity pricing improves, which we are not counting on happening this year.</p>
<p>At AES, Q2 was a pretty decent quarter for AES, nice financial contribution. We are up today slightly on activity. From Q2 today, we are running 98 jobs. So, we have increased market share is in the U.S. not unlike Canada, very price sensitive market. I would attribute our gains against our competitors to technology and better service. We are doing well in the Northeast U.S. We have serviced some deep Utica wells. Customers are reporting very big production numbers out of that play. We see some business on the books for guys to take a little bit more of their drilling money maybe out of the Marcellus and put it into the Utica. That’s good for our business. Those wells are very high pressure. They are deep. They are complicated to drill. And we have a track record doing that for some of the biggest operators in the Northeast U.S.</p>
<p>Our MMH technology that we acquired about 1.5 years ago, that continues to perform very well for our customers. We are having most of the success within West Texas. We have got a couple of new customers coming online. Happy to report that a Tier 1 who has been using this technology on about a half dozen rigs for most of the past year is publicly stated that their advanced mud system has saved them the need for intermediate casing across a salt interval and effectively saved them about 5 days of drilling time. That’s the kind of sort of evidence or information that when a customer goes live with, we can trade on that as a service company and win new work. It verifies what we represent to the customers, so we are quite excited about that. Our clay free invert also continues to gain traction in all markets. That is a system that allows the operator to drill further horizontally and maintain optimal hydraulics in the well bore, which allows you to clean the hole properly and extend those lateral legs.</p>
<p>Our expectation for the U.S. drilling market has been in the absence of an oil price increase, common sense tells us that probably the U.S. rig count for an industry starts to go off for the next four, five months, don’t see how it stays as strong as it is. With oil in the low 40s, we think we can hold our share. We think our strategy of being price competitive and offering solutions that our competitors don’t have which worked. We think that’s going to allow us to remain somewhere around 10%, maybe a touch over. We are working hard to high grade our talent. In West Texas, that market is becoming increasingly complex to drill. And so we need people that are highly technical to sell our technology there. This is a good time in the industry to be able to attract talent.</p>
<p>I will move on to JACAM. JACAM had a great Q2. We have continued to make price concessions for customers as required. The second, call it, collapse of oil prices has ignited a new round of price pressure from customers. I think listeners probably are hearing that from all services. If you are not, you are hearing it from us. Our expectation in general is that we are going to continue to need to sharpen our pencil to win new business or keep the business we have. We like the fact that we are very vertically integrated as a business. We are not going to do business that doesn’t create profit, but we do expect the need to do business that creates less as a percentage in order to keep what drilling work or completion work there is to get and obviously to treat what is increasing production in North America.</p>
<p>We won some new additional pipeline business in West Texas, this summer for JACAM. This is from a major pipeline company. We won about 40% of their business. And I am happy to add that – and it’s a common practice that Midstream companies, E&amp;P companies, wants some competitive influence or pressure in when they select their suppliers. So, the part of the business that we haven’t been awarded, we are going to treat for corrosion with Supercore. We have picked that chemistry through the line. We are very excited to see that our efforts to better market this patented and highly effective corrosion inhibitor is starting to pay off.</p>
<p>We are winning new treating or production chemical business in Texas, in North Dakota, Montana, Colorado and Utah. Many of those new pieces of business have started by introducing the concept of using solid chemistry to solve problems that liquid chemistry can’t get to or solve, gets us in the door with the customer. One thing leads to another and you start treating all the production.</p>
<p>A part of our business for JACAM that we are very focused on and happy to report is going well is that we are actively trying to recruit high-end talent to deliver the message that we have unique products that we can solve problems so that we can grow our business. As competitors consolidate, as private businesses that sold to private equity go through the changes that happened as ownerships change, talent is coming to the market. What we have to offer potential employees is the ability to represent a company that believes in science, that is basic in reactions, and that has a growing and winning culture. Through the second quarter, we did see a bit of completion or frac chemistry sales resume. I would describe them as okay. There is obviously still a lot of wells being drilled and not completed. For listeners’ benefit, what we sell in that space is buy a side, scale inhibitor, sometimes corrosion inhibitor. It’s a good place for our business. It’s an area that we are focused on. We are focused on recruiting talent that can either sell independent pumper their chemistry or sell certain E&amp;Ps that have went ahead and got their own frac spreads. We think that’s a piece of the industry that can be a big growth market for us in time.</p>
<p>Summer for PureChem in Canada has gotten off to a great start. Through the second quarter, we were successful in recruiting some really top end talent. We attracted some really strong people for production chemicals that have a background in heavy oil. We recruited some talent that has a lot of experience in treating pipelines. And we have recruited some high end talent that understands the frac space, that has already translated into new business in the summer. Remind people again that we need to be very competitive on price to win this new business. We are making money at it. But our pencil is sharp because that’s what it takes when your customer is not making money.</p>
<p>We have seen recently, a very significant flow of RFPs for PureChem in Canada. We think that signals two things. One, the customers are starting to take PureChem very seriously. They see us an option to the two major incumbents or suppliers into the industry. We also think we are realistic with ourselves. The other thing it signals is that the customer is looking for better pricing. By being vertically integrated, having the right talent, having unique technology, we like our chances to win some of these RFPs, put new business on the books, continue to expand our footprint of people and places that we stage the products and be able to make a modest profit on that business. We are winning new business in Canada, treating pipelines and a lot in general that PureChem has become a significant part of our Canadian business.</p>
<p>I will update people on expansion infrastructure. We are happy to report that we are going to be crushing and packaging barite this fall. We expect no later than Halloween and maybe late September, early October, the benefit to the company for this is that it will lower our cost of goods of this ground-up heavy rock that goes into oil drilling fluids. So our cost of goods on jobs that we are all doing will go down. This will also allow us to do swaps with other mineral companies. So where other mineral companies would have mines or mills and mines, we would swap supply in the Gulf Coast and take products from those mining companies, say where logistics make more sense to pull it out of there. We also believe longer term that we can sell this product to independent drilling fluid companies in the lower-48.</p>
<p>Our nitrile and hydrogenation expansion projects are coming along well. Nitrile will be live sometime this fall. We are very close there. I got a good question from someone last night by e-mail. I will try and give some color on why this is important to us. It will allow the company to become more basic in biocides, corrosion inhibitors, foamers or surfactants and it will allow us to be completely basic in the organo – of organo clay, that’s the chemistry that you spray on pulverized clay that viscosifies oil-based muds. This will lower our cost of goods. It will overall increase throughput of the company. It will allow us to be more competitive when oil was $40. So those are very good developments for the business.</p>
<p>Our Calgary lab will open in late September. This will provide us with a significant expansion around our ability to problem solve or service existing production in Canada. It will allow us to take on more R&amp;D sort of initiatives or challenges. We are confident that we are going to be able to recruit some high end talent to work in this facility. Specifically, it will increase our capabilities around sour gas, corrosion. It will allow us to look at formation damage, which is a big part of what goes into designing the chemistry for fracking. It will allow us to do better scale analysis. Overall, we think that that will be a tool to grow sales in the business. Our Midland lab, our foundation and septic field are in. We are well underway there. We think it’s important that it signals to both the customer and to talent we are trying to attract in that market, that we are committed to West Texas, that we can problem solve where the production is. We think that’s going to be another tool to grow sales.</p>
<p>Our Houston lab, we are going to need to go to a different location than where our mud lab is. We have made the decision that some of the capabilities we want in that lab would have us handling volatile substances. We can’t put those in the building where our mud lab is today. So we are out shopping for suitable space. We are confident that we are going to find something that’s appropriate. And likely early sometime in ‘16, maybe middle of ‘16 we could go live with the new lab in that market. I will remind people that our belief is we need to go to where the talent is, to recruit some of the world-class scientists that we want to bring into the business. That’s why we would locate that lab there.</p>
<p>Our strategy to go through the near-term, just to be frank is to be price competitive. Without the work to the past 5 years to backward integrate the business, that would be virtually impossible. The customer today is not making very much money on new wells they drill, if any at all. They are making some money on existing production through hedges. But in general, we understand that the customers’ hurting a lot right now, so you need to be able to sharpen your pencil to be the supplier to the operator in this environment. We have the ability to be where we need to be on price, to remain sort of moderately profitable and importantly keep our talented people, keep training them and keep recruiting world-class people, so that we can take share in our service lines. And when better days come, be the company that thrives.</p>
<p>Longer term for our business, our strategy is to try to expand our production chemical business in the U.S., our production chemical business in Canada. We are very focused on pipelines. We believe that there is a big opportunity to be a major supplier to the pumpers or E&amp;Ps that are running their own frac spreads. We make this stuff that go into these fracs where basic. We believe longer-term that the customer does not want to buy things from resellers, so we think that’s an opportunity that we want to act on. We also see significant opportunity in enhanced recovery that requires chemistry, polymers. We are basic in many of those materials and are focused on growing those markets. Longer term, we are going to remain a chemical company, we are not going to become an equipment company to help us sell chemical. We are going to make chemical. We are going to turn it. What we are going to need for physical assets are trucks that can deliver it and pump it and we are going to need the plants that can make this stuff.</p>
<p>I will turn the call over to Craig to give a financial update and then we will take questions.</p>
<p><strong>Craig Nieboer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Tom. Q2 financial results obviously reflected of the difficult industry conditions that Tom just described in detail, including year-over-year lower activity at the drill bit and discounting of our products across our business in order to meet the customer needs. This was offset by continued growth in our production specialty chemical business in both Canada and the United States year-over-year and obviously, the benefit year-over-year of the weakness in the Canadian dollar boosting our U.S. earnings revenue represented 78% of our revenue in Q2. Gross revenue for the quarter was $163.1 million compared to $189.8 million last year for Q2, for a decrease of 14%. Our EBITDAC of $19.6 million was comparable to the $31.4 million in Q2 of 2014 for a decrease of 38% year-over-year. Our consumable chemicals business model has performed though as expected in the activity downturn, with the harvesting of a large amount of working capital back into cash. At June 30, we were just under $50 million of cash on the balance sheet and we have a $200 million undrawn operating line.</p>
<p>As of the date of this call, we are about $60 million of cash on the balance sheet. Our expectations is that, that sort of apex of what our cash harvest probably will be for the year, as some activities picked up and as the continued growth in the production specialty chemical business goes, we will like to start drawdown our cash balance for the remainder of this year. But in any event, we have strong financial flexibility as we face the challenges of industry. As well yesterday with our earnings release, we announced the – we declared a cash dividend for the month of $0.0275 per share, which is consistent with previous months and that will be paid to shareholders of record on August 31 and that will be paid on September 15.</p>
<p>At this time I guess, we will open up the call to questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question is from Mark Westby from AltaCorp Capital.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Westby</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning guys. Thanks for the detail.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Mark.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Westby</span></strong></p>
<p>So I guess, starting with the big stuff on the M&amp;A front, other management teams on conference calls have been noting that the gap is closing somewhat between acquisition targets and acquirers, so what are your thoughts and approach to acquisition opportunities at this point?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>We are always open to ways to accelerate the growth of either PureChem or JACAM. We don’t think we need to do that in the drilling fluid business. For us, it hasn’t been an issue of sort of a spread and valuation, our focus is can we work with the people. These products don’t make themselves. They don’t apply or sell themselves. So we are most focused on what’s the cultural fit for our business. This is something that we really need or could we just do it ourselves with who we have. But we are out looking at ways to grow the business. We think that we have got a big place in the market in the U.S. treating production. We think we have become probably number three in the production chemical business in Canada already. Probably in Canada the strategy is to attract the talent. We are not in a rush, Mark to do anything. Unfortunately, it looks like low commodity prices are here for a while. So we are going to be patient. We are going to take our time. We are going to look for ways to grow sales channels or maybe bring some new technology into the business. If we see something that we really like, that we are confident, we will have staying power, we will act on it. And if we don’t, we are just going to keep adding people and growing that way.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Westby</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks. I guess my next question with regard to the margins obviously, took a bit of a hit with spring breakup and pricing working in concert there, but recovering into Q3 and coming out of spring breakup, how much you think margins will recover and to what degree?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t know if I think they will recover at all. I think that there is going to be relentless price pressure. One of the things we pride ourselves on around here is that we are working managers. We are out seeing the customers, seeing the supplier. We are trying to keep our finger on what the customer needs as we run this business. And every conversation right now leads with what is the cost. So what we think people should expect is that there is going to be pressure on margins. We think that we have technologies, a track record that’s better than our competition. And we are going to defend what we have. We are not going to work to breakeven or lose money. But I don’t know whether there is room to raise margins right now. Obviously, the Canadian dollar works in our favor, overall because so much of our business is U.S. based. But there is no room to raise any prices. And everybody with this second collapse of oil has renewed vigor to put price pressure on services.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Craig Nieboer</span></strong></p>
<p>So Mark from a detailed level, yes, we don’t see margin increasing on product sales. But I think part of your question is that Q2 is a slow quarter in Canada and traditionally we have fixed costs that have to be covered by less revenues, so there will be on the financial statement level, there should be an increase in our gross margin and EBITDA margin in Q3 and Q4 over Q2, but unlikely to recover to the gross margin and EBITDA margin we had in Q1 this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Westby</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Craig Nieboer</span></strong></p>
<p>So somewhere between Q2 and Q1, but it’s not going to get back to what Q1 was.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Westby</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. Okay, great. Thanks guys. And I guess on the pricing side of things, just a couple more quick questions. You had mentioned on the last call, drilling fluids pricing was down about 12% to 20%, including consumables down 5% to 7% and that production chemicals at that time were down 5% to 10%, have you seen – obviously you have seen a bit more pricing reduction, since then are you able to provide any detail on the scale of that or…?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Mark. We are not prepared to quantify things. What we can say is that we are not going to work to lose money. We are not going to work just to keep people with something to do, but oils went down again. And there is a second wave of pressure and you need to blink as a service provider. And so we just want people to understand that we think we can keep what we have on the drilling side. We think we can grow treatment points at JACAM and PureChem, but you are going to need to sharpen your pencil to make all that come together.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Westby</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, fair enough. And just to finish off on a bit of a higher point obviously, production chemicals have done really well over the last few quarters and are you – I know you don’t disclose financials specifically on those segments, but are you able to provide some indication of the scale of revenue increases year-over-year or quarter-over-quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>No. We are winning new business all the time. So we will leave it at that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Westby</span></strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. Okay, thanks a lot guys. Thanks for the detail.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question is from Steve Kammermayer with Clarus Securities. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Kammermayer</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, guys. Just back on the pricing here, just given where oil was through Q2, how did pricing in Q2 compared with Q1?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>In drilling fluids, they would have been probably the same. And in production chemicals, maybe a touch less because we started to lower pricing for production chemicals in the States, sort of part way through Q1. So if you kind of pencil that out, you got a full quarter at lower prices in Q2 versus some of it in Q1 was prior to when you started giving extra discounts.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Kammermayer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just for the pricing pressure going forward, I know you didn’t want to disclose it, but would it be less than the magnitude we saw the decline in Q1 of that 20% on the drilling fluid and 7% on the production, would it come in less than those declines?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>We are not going to work to breakeven. We are not going to make chemicals to sell them at cost. We know what it costs to pay our people. So, it can’t be as much, Steve because there is not that much to give.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Kammermayer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>But you need to work with guys, for sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Kammermayer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just going through the MD&amp;A, you mentioned some professional fees related to taxes and internal restructuring, can you just give us the size of that charge in the quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Craig Nieboer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It’s not a huge number. It’s like few hundred thousand dollars Stephen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Kammermayer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just one more, maybe on the other income related to the Venture Mud, the reversal of the earn-out, if activity stay sort of flat from here like you are expecting, can we expect another reversal of the remaining amount and when would you take that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Craig Nieboer</span></strong></p>
<p>At this stage, our estimates are that the remaining amounts of earn-outs that are on the deferred acquisition line of our financial statements will be paid when they are due based on our estimates.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Kammermayer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, perfect. That’s all I had guys. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] The next question is from Elias Foscolos from Industrial Alliance. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Elias Foscolos</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. Just wanted to focus on any – if there were any restructuring charges in Q2 that might potentially add to savings going forward, a lot of other service companies have been pushing them through?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Craig Nieboer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Elias, we have reduced headcounts in particular in the drilling side of the business. We have reduced variable compensation schemes. We have rationalized operating costs wherever we can. So, obviously those “cost savings” will go forward for us in this environment. But on the flip side, with the growing production in specialty chemical business, we have been adding headcount on that side of the business. We have been adding stock points on that side of the business. So, we have a bifurcation of kind of how it’s going in our business from the part that’s at the drillbit having contracted in the parts at the pump-jack still growing. So, I don’t see significant changes to our cost structure based on what we have in the financial statements in Q2 going forward. I don’t see it going down.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Elias Foscolos</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Focusing on one other part of the cost structure, you will have barite crushing and other facilities come online. So, while you might be getting some top line pressure, do you see any order of magnitude alleviation through the vertical integration on that side that you are pursuing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t think I would call them in order of magnitude. There is a benefit to us from that mill or we wouldn’t have built it, but not in order of magnitude.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Elias Foscolos</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. But, you probably – from an economic what of view, it would be viable?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. And that mill will be crushing ore 20 years after Craig and I aren’t working. The life of that thing is decades and decades. It’s a critical part of having a scaled drilling fluid business. So, we are pleased that we built it. We wish it had been done a year ago when things were going and blowing, because it would have made a really big impact, but it’s going to benefit all parts of our business. And one day, when oil is not $45, it will make an even bigger impact.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Elias Foscolos</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much. That’s it for me.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] The next question is from John Bereznicki with Canaccord Genuity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Bereznicki</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, good morning gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, John.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Bereznicki</span></strong></p>
<p>I have noticed kind of very deep in the MD&amp;A you have placed some credit insurance on your U.S. receivables. Just wondering if you can give us a little color behind that? And kind of maybe contrast what you are seeing in the U.S. versus Canada as far as your customer behavior goes?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Craig Nieboer</span></strong></p>
<p>So, John, we actually made a decision to place that insurance back in December. I think as we saw commodity prices falling off, we were concerned that some of our customers might be overconfident in their activity and run into financial difficulty. I think we really didn’t see a difference in the risk between our U.S. customers and our Canadian customers. I think for us it was probably at the executive management level we just are a lot closer to what’s going on in Canada and our Canadian customers. And the wings have changed and things on the street are happening. And so we felt more comfortable with that risk being, call it, self-insured in managing AR as we always have very carefully and credit risk very carefully. On the U.S. side, because the market is more splintered, it’s in different places and once again at an executive management level, we are just not as close to every single customer as we are here. We just felt we would explore what credit insurance would look like and the pricing came back and for basically $0.25 million we got up to $0.5 billion of trade credit insurance over U.S. receivables for 2015. We thought that was a pretty good trade.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Bereznicki</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. That makes sense. Thanks. And then just real quickly, you seem to be making some good traction in the pipeline, Midstream Square. Going forward, is that something you can continue to grow organically by adding the right people or are there some small tuck-ins out there maybe that would make sense for you?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Simons</span></strong></p>
<p>Right now, John, we are very confident that, that is potentially a huge part of our business in the future and it’s about the people. We need to bring the talent and that can handle the business on behalf of the Midstream operator. We have the products that will extend the life, improve the safety of those assets for midstream companies. So, yes, that’s a place of particular focus. If we found a team that could accelerate that or somebody had a technology to apply the chemistry that might be interesting to us, but I am not into meeting. We have that in the queue, we don’t, but it’s an area of particular focus for us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Bereznicki</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. That’s great color. Thanks, guys. All my other questions have been answered.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to the presenters.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Simons</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, we will – I have probably been pretty pessimistic on things for people. We are very proud of the position that the business finds itself in today. We are undrawn on our line. We have $60 million cash in the bank. And most importantly, we have got the bones of something that can be great and can be much bigger. We are a vertically integrated business. Production in North America is rising. We are increasingly becoming one of the top choices to treat that production. We are developing a really solid reputation treating pipelines. We see a big market to supply chemistry to the frac space. We already are a major player at the drilling rig in drilling fluids in both countries. And all of that happens because of the people that we have been able to bring into the business. We are focused on adding more talented people. This is a very unique time in industry with all of the consolidation that is going on of our competitors. And in the past two or three years, private equity has bought a lot of private chemical businesses. We think that provides us with opportunity. We think that businesses that are operated by the owner are probably pretty focused. Businesses that are owned by a sponsor probably lose some of their focus. So, we think that creates opportunity.</p>
<p>So, in general, while the near-term is very challenging, our business can remain profitable. It can pay its dividend. And it can maintain a pristine balance sheet. We think we can take our people through this. We are making small adjustments or leaning out in certain parts of the business that makes sense that don’t compromise our quality. But overall, long-term, we remain very optimistic about the future of our business. I want callers to know that. But we also take pride in telling people what we actually believe. And what we believe today is that there is a lot of price pressure that the U.S. rig count for the industry, it looks to us, stands to go down a bit, but we are going to get our part of it and we are going to keep growing the chemical side.</p>
<p>With that, I will wrap it up. I would like to say thank you to our customers for their business through the summer and for our people for trusting us as we go through this tough time. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>This concludes today’s conference call. You may now disconnect.</p>
