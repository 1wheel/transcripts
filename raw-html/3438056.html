<p><strong>Douglas Milroy</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Thanks for calling in. Presumably you've seen our press release and you know that we had a very strong quarter and in a record setting years. So we're clearly glad to have the chance to talk with you about it.</p>
<p>This morning I'd like to talk about three things. I'd like to hit some of the highlights of the quarter and the year. I'd like to talk about our game plan for the coming year. And I'd like talk about our newly introduced long-term financial goals. And then as always Tracy will provide some more detail for you.</p>
<p>If I start with the quarter, as I said very strong quarter organic revenue growth 5%. OI margin continued to expand 60 basis points. Earnings were up 9% and ROIC expanded 50 basis points. We did take a $0.12 charge increase in our environmental reserves that was clearly a necessary action. It's in the bucket of the right thing to do. And it was entirely consistent with our core value of environmental stewardship and as I alluded to earlier Tracy, will provide you some more detail. But net-net, a very strong quarter.</p>
<p>And as I said capping off a nice year, if look back at the full year, I remain incredibly proud of what our team did here in 2015. We had full year organic growth of 5.6% that's over a 100 basis points more than our organic growth rate in the prior year. So, not surprisingly that led to record adjusted operating income and record earnings per share and that all nebs out as always in this business to strong cash flow from operations. We were up 24% over last year, which was a strong cash flow year for us.</p>
<p>In fact, it would have been an all-time record have we chosen not to settle our MEPP liabilities in the quarter that was just a timing decision on our part and if we hadn't done that, it would have been a substantial record for our company. So with cash king, that's a nice way to finish the year.</p>
<p>I think it's always important to point out, not just the financials, but that they're underpinned by good business performance. We set in the year new all-time highs for our customer satisfaction scores and therefore, not surprisingly customer retention remained right in there near last year's record level.</p>
<p>We saw record new account sales, that's our second year in a row proving that the rebuilding that we've talked about is really taking all. Last year, it wasn't just a one-time ping and one-time pop, but we turned around and beat even that record this year and we've moved our plan to operations to our record level of productivity.</p>
<p>So clearly strong operating metrics underpinning our good financial performance. As you're aware these results are not unusual for this team. We've clearly established a record of this kind of consistent performance, just call out a couple of things that's our fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share growth. That's our 13 consecutive quarter, with year-over-year improvement in both OI and ROIC, which you know to have been our key focus.</p>
<p>So where do you go from here? It's the question we ask ourselves every year at this time. Where do you go from here? And I'm guessing you won't be surprised, we largely stay the course. If I step back a little bit and put that in context we really like this core business. We've said it a number of times, we're big core business folks and we continue to see a lot of value creation opportunity in our core business. It is fundamentally a very attractive business model. And when we look at it and look at our performance within it, we're convinced there is still significant opportunity to expand margins to further expand our return on invested capital and we remain confident we can sustain and in fact eventually accelerate the kind of the revenue growth rates that you've seen here.</p>
<p>When we look at that we're sure of it, because of the high return opportunities we see. The opportunities we see to continue to invest in the business and you've seen a step that up nicely over the last couple of years in terms of the capital expenditures, we expect good returns from those investments and perhaps even more exciting is we've got a good pipeline of similar future projects.</p>
<p>So in short, we like not just our business model, but our approach for executing on it. And so we're going to stick with our game plan for another year. You know the key elements, keep our customer promise, take great care of our customers, continue to develop and further our capability to provide outstanding customer service that's the first leg of it. Continue to improve, how we target customers, pick where we want to play, play where we know we can win.</p>
<p>Continue to strive for operational excellence is the third driving continuous improvement and looking for productivity improvements across the business, not just in our plans but in all functional areas. And then four then and I guess, I believe, most importantly is just to continue to develop this great team. We've obviously got a very strong to be able to post again this year, these kind of results and how do we continue to focus on that team and develop that team and further strengthen that team. Those will be the four elements of our game plan going into the coming year.</p>
<p>At the same time kind of overlaying that, we've clearly earned our right to grow. We used to talk about the imperative of at least earning our cost of capital before we started thinking about growth and we're well beyond that at this stage. So, we have clearly earned our right to grow. We began that shift a couple of years ago and we will continue our shift towards growth. We believe we've got the foundation in place now to do that. What does that mean? It means we'll continue to invest in several key drivers of growth, continue to further our investments in our sales forces, our sales force staffing, sales force productivity. You've seen us take our sales force numbers up in terms of size and we anticipate continuing to do that.</p>
<p>We'll continue around all of our product offering, our service offering, continue to spend the marketing dollars that we have, that best position the company. We'll continue to make good capital investments. We've invested smartly in technology, that's added capability and improved our operations and because of our growth there have been places, where it's been necessary to expand capacity.</p>
<p>And on a selected basis, we'll continue to do that. And the last growth driver, all our hopes and dreams haven't yet been met through an aggressive acquisition campaign but it's not for a lack of focus and energy around it and we'll maintain that. We still believe that there is opportunities there, they're few and far between right now, but we will remain focused on that.</p>
<p>So I think a handful of key drivers of growth will add nicely to the story. Remember that I guess putting that all together, we're confident that we can continue to balance the investments I've just described with the imperative that you know we have for delivering strong near-term performance and we think we're walking that balance pretty well. We're confident that that will turn into our continuing record as a high performing company and generate a lot of free cash and that free cash gives us a lot of flexibility on how to improve shareholder returns.</p>
<p>So that I would link to - you presumably saw our dividend increase today and our increased share repurchase authorization, both illustrating our commitment to continue to return cash appropriately. And I think perhaps more importantly that feels like our corporate finance angle to me, I think perhaps most importantly, that should signal a lot of confidence, confidence as I've described in the business model, in our ability to execute on it, on our team, it illustrates that. And I believe in the end, there is a formula for creating a lot of shareholder value.</p>
<p>So with all that bullishness, that brings me to our new financial goals we rolled out this morning. I would first say that this notion of setting goals and chasing them has been very productive for our company. The 12+ Plan has been a terrific success for us.</p>
<p>Candidly I think we essentially got there a little faster than even we expected and we are essentially there. I think it's a real testimonial to the team I spoke to earlier to the strength of this company and we find ourselves that's a 12 plus plan though we haven't exactly hit the number. No longer usefully frames up the discussions we find ourselves now.</p>
<p>When we sit with you as investors, the focus is always, okay what's next, what's next, what's beyond that, and we've talked about these plans, these goals are important, as important internally as externally. And internally, I can tell you it's kind of hard to rally an organization towards less spend FY 2016 chasing around the year.</p>
<p>And so whether you look at it internally or externally, our 12 plus plan no longer frames up the discussion well. And so as such we decided it was time to introduce a new set of long-term financial goals that we think really do frame-up at least the next stage of opportunity. We're still not labeling at the end game, but at least the next stage of opportunity for us.</p>
<p>And that's our 2015, five goals. 15% operating margin, 15% return on invested capital and we are adding for the first time a defined growth goal, 5% or greater average revenue growth and you and we have become accustomed to talking about goals in a two year to four year timeframe. We will achieve these goals again in a two year to four year timeframe from today.</p>
<p>So, I guess I'd tell you as with our past financial goals, I anticipate there will be some bumps along the road or there has been over the last five years, six years there will be over the next five years, six years. We'll run into challenges that today we know about and we'll run into some we don't know about.</p>
<p>And as a result, I'm not convinced, our progress towards these goals would be a straight line. I think it's pretty clear that 2016 shaping up to have a share of challenges, FX is a challenge for us, oil and gas is still playing out the strong dollar and how it is affecting exports from the U.S. in particular.</p>
<p>So, 2016 is shaping up with the share of challenges. But again, I always feel, it's important to look candidly and squarely at those, realistically, to look at those. But to remind ourselves, hey we're used to that, we're used to that. We work through that kind of stuff over the last five years or six years and we'll work through whatever challenges come our way in 2016.</p>
<p>You've seen, this is a team that can set these goals out there and go chase some - and go get theme regardless of, I guess, what I've referred to as the bumps along the way. And we're absolutely confident that, that we'll do that here with these new 15/5 goals.</p>
<p>So, in summary, another strong year of profitable growth for our company, delivered by an outstanding team, it continues the multi-year trend of consistent strong performance that you've seen. And we remain as confident as we ever have that, our best years still lie ahead and we thought our 15/5 goals would serve us well to, to frame that comment up. So, very fun year to, to look back out and a very exciting year to look ahead too.</p>
<p>So, with that, Tracy if you take us through the details and then I'll answer any questions you may have. Tracy?</p>
<p><strong>Tracy Jokinen</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks, Doug and good morning everyone. As Doug mentioned this morning, I'll provide more details on the fourth quarter and our full year results. And then I'll discuss the capital allocation decisions, we announced today and our outlook for the next fiscal year. So, let's start with the results for the quarter. Revenue grew 3% to $237 million and organic growth was solidly in the mid-single- digit range coming in at 5%. For the full year, our organic growth was 5.6%.</p>
<p>Once again our organic growth was led by strong new account sales driven by increases in the size of our sales force along with improved seller productivity. And revenue also continued to benefit from strong customer retention and solid pricing.</p>
<p>Our add-quit metric was negative this quarter, although it did improve compared to the third quarter. This strong organic growth was partially offset by the impact of foreign currency exchange, which reduced fourth quarter revenue growth by 2%. For the full year, currency translation reduced revenue growth by 1.5%.</p>
<p>Fourth quarter adjusted operating income grew about 8% to $28 million, driven by both the revenue gains and continued margin expansions. Adjusted operating margins increased 60 basis points to 11.9%, driven primarily by lower energy costs along with productivity improvements and operating leverage from our top line growth. These margin gains were partially offset by higher rental merchandise expense and higher healthcare insurance costs, which were up primarily due to increased claims experience.</p>
<p>As Doug mentioned, we recorded a $0.12 per share charge for an increase to our environmental reserves. We excluded this item from our adjusted results in order to provide a better view of the underlying performance of our business and you can find a reconciliation table in our earnings release. The increase in this reserve was primarily related to expected cost for remediation at four of our locations. These are locations that G&amp;K previously acquired where the prior owners conducted dry cleaning operations.</p>
<p>It's not an uncommon issue in our industry and it's an issue that we've successfully dealt within the past as part of our normal operations. What's important to understand is that, at three of these four facilities, the previous owners were contractually obligated to conduct remediations. However, we determined that the prior owners will no longer be able to meet these obligations due to their financial condition or bankruptcies. We'll continue to perform the required remediation works and in the meantime, we'll also pursue all available remedies against the former owners.</p>
<p>Concurrently with this remediation work, we conducted a review of all of our other properties and based on its review, we've initiated a process of assessing six other G&amp;K sites that also had historical dry cleaning operations. These actions are consistent with our core value of environmental stewardship. And as I mentioned previously we've successfully dealt with these type of situations in the past as part of our normal operations and we're confident that we can meet our environmental obligations with minimal disruption to our business.</p>
<p>So now let me turn back to the results for the quarter and the non-operating lines on our income statement. Interest expense, tax rate and share count were largely unchanged from the prior year, so putting it altogether, adjusted earnings were 9% to $0.83 per share. For the full year, adjusted earnings grew 13% to $3.28. We also continued to improve return on invested capital. On a three-month annualized basis, ROIC was 11.1%, 50 basis points better than the fourth quarter last year</p>
<p>Shifting to our balance sheet and cash flow statements, G&amp;K's overall financial position remains very strong. We had a terrific year of cash flow with cash from operations of $94 million, which was up 24% compared to fiscal 2014. It was primarily driven by higher net income along with better working capital management and we had nice improvements in both day’s receivable outstanding and day’s payable outstanding.</p>
<p>During the quarter, we made a final settlement payment to the center and state multi-employer pension plans. The settlement was within our previously established reserves that had no impact on our income statement, however, did have a negative impact on cash flow of about $20 million after tax.</p>
<p>This settlement was a good decision for G&amp;K and releases us from future liabilities with the central state funds. It's also worth noting while this was a rate economic decision, the timing of the payment did create a near-term headwind for ROIC, so if we exclude the impact of the settlement payment, ROIC would have been a 11.5% in the quarter. We're still working through final settlements with the few other multi-employer plans which we expect to result within our remaining reserves of $9 million.</p>
<p>With our strong cash flow and balance sheet, I wanted to take a few moments to comment on capital deployment and the actions that we announced today. We remain committed to the disciplined capital allocation strategy, which we've articulated in the past and our first priority remains investing in our business, accordingly we increased capital expenditures this year to $56 million from $33 million last year. And I just into our normal maintenance CapEx, this year we also invested in new plants and equipment to enable growth and in several information technology projects in that enhancing our ability to serve customers and improved productivity across of our business. We expect a comparable level of capital expenditures in fiscal 2016.</p>
<p>Our second priority is smart acquisition and as Doug mentioned we continue to look for attractive opportunities. Third, we want to maintain an efficient capital structure, keeping our cost of capital low. Our business model and strong cash flows support a reasonable degree of levers and the refinancing that we completed earlier in the year, provide ample capacity to execute our capital plans. Finally, we remain committed to return in cash to our shareholders.</p>
<p>In fiscal 2015, we returned a total of $42 million to shareholders via two streams, dividends and share repurchases. We plan to increase, both of these gains in fiscal 2016. This morning, we announced a 19% increase in our regular dividends, our 10th consecutive year with the dividend increase. We also announced the $100 million increase to our share repurchase authorization. This provides us flexibility to continue to incrementally increase our share buybacks.</p>
<p>Finally, depending on our circumstances and market conditions, we'll also continue to evaluate the potential for future special dividend or larger share repurchases. And the bottom for investors is that strong cash flow and a disciplined approach to capital deployment will remain key elements of G&amp;K's value proposition. So let me conclude with some comments on our outlook for the next fiscal year.</p>
<p>In fiscal 2016, we expect to drive continued progress across our key financial metrics, making a strong start to our new 15/5 financial goals. First I would like to clarify that fiscal 2016 will have 53 weeks of operation, compared to 52 weeks in fiscal 2015. This will increase both revenue and earnings per share by approximately 2% over fiscal 2015. The guidance we issued this morning includes the impact of the 53rd week.</p>
<p>We forecast revenue in the range of $970 million to $1 billion, we expect to deliver another year of solid mid-single digit organic growth. However, foreign currency translation will remain a significant headwind next year. The Canadian dollar is currently trading near 10 year low versus the U.S. dollar and it's more than 10% below the average exchange rate during our fiscal 2015.</p>
<p>As today's exchange rate, both revenue and earnings per share will be reduced 1.5% to 2% next year and this is reflected in our guidance. We expect the headwind from currency exchange will be greater than the first half of our fiscal year especially in the first quarter and in fact as today's exchange rate, our first quarter revenue and earnings would be reduced by nearly 3% compared to fiscal 2015.</p>
<p>We're expecting earnings per share in the range of $3.50 to $3.70. In addition to the solid revenue growth, we expect continued margin expansion from executing our game plan. These improvements will be partially offset by headwinds from currency exchange.</p>
<p>Looking at the non-operating lines of our income statement, we forecast slightly higher interest expense due to the debt refinancing we completed this year. We're expecting our tax rate closer to 38% compared to 36.4% this year. And we expect share count will decline slightly to approximately 20 million shares as we increase share buyback.</p>
<p>So, to wrap up, this was a strong quarter tapping another record setting year for G&amp;K. Our strong cash flow and balance sheet, together with continued improvement in our game plan, position us well for the future. We expect to deliver continued top line and bottom line growth in fiscal 2016 as we begin to advance towards our new financial goals.</p>
<p>And with that, we are ready to take your questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Sean Egan. Sean, your line is open, you may be on mute.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Egan</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, Sean. Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Egan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, great. Thank you. So, I appreciate a little bit of the color that you gave on some of the organic growth drivers. But can you maybe give us a sense of the magnitude of each driver, I mean was it primarily new account growth, maybe with a little price, et cetera. I mean anymore color would be appreciated.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, Sean, so if we think about the 5% organic growth rate that we delivered. The single biggest driver is new account sales, we had record new account sales for the year. We had, we did have some improved pricing, which is also driving some of our growth and then our retention levels are at a record level consistent with the record we set in fiscal 2014.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Egan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thanks. And then kind of walking down the P&amp;L to the operating margin increase, are there any specific examples you might be able to give us of some of the productivity gains that you alluded to, I mean whether any primary contributors or was they just kind of the simple chipping away and getting little better every day?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Sean, I would say is the later and I would go back to, I guess I'd make a couple of comments. First I go back to our optic-pro system that we put in place a couple of years ago, it false from the headlines, but it shouldn't. When we make IT investments, we view them as nothing more than tools that we're providing to our team.</p>
<p>And even in the hands of the best craftsmen, a tool just - the use of it, just gets better over time. And so I still believe, we're getting gains from that system and its used on a daily basis. The other bucket is more exactly which you talk about just chipping away a little at a time or what we call continuous improvement.</p>
<p>And making sure that your entire team is engaged and how do we do things just a little bit faster, a little better cost structure, a little higher quality today than we did yesterday. And just keep pushing that forward every day, every month, every quarter and that's the result you see in continuing our record productivity level. So, I credit those two buckets the most.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Egan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. And then just to kind of round out my questions here, within your stated remarks, Doug, you talked about as one of the drivers are going to get to your new goals, as a [ph] branding out your product offering? Can you expand a little bit on that comment? Are you looking to enter new lines of business? And can you just help me reconcile that comment with kind of sticking with the core business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. So, I would say that it's largely offerings that fit well within our core business. So, if you think about just our core business it's staying trend right. It's making sure, it's rounding off the product offering such that the garments were offered at any point and time fit the trends in the marketplace. So, that's part of continuing to round out and expand your product offering. It's also continuing our focus on FR, which you've seen has been a real strength for us. If things like our more recent introduction to first aid, not of a magnitude, where it's going to change the whole company, but it's a nice offering that our customers value.</p>
<p>And then I guess, the last one I would highlight is, you'll recall here 18 months ago we finalized the rebuilding of our direct sale operations. And we like the feel of that, it continues to grow nicely and represents a nice rounding off of product offering for our customers. So in short there is still significant opportunity to either change, modify, continue to upgrade the product offering we have or add ancillary products to it that are still all within an umbrella I would call our core business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Egan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thank you. And then last one for Tracy. I'm curious, can you help us understand a little bit more on the rationale behind the share repurchase program? I mean at today's price it represents, I mean I think you got about 9% of outstanding shares with that $130 million in total. What was kind of the rationale behind boosting the program to the magnitude that you did versus say just a special dividend or another way to deploy the capital?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tracy Jokinen</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the timing as I indicated, our prior authorization was nearly exhausted, we have about $20 million that was remaining under that authorization. So, increasing the program by about $100 million provides us continued flexibility to increase our current buyback program and evaluate larger share buybacks in the future.</p>
<p>Now, having said that, we're very committed to returning excess cash to shareholders through those two recurring streams of our quarterly dividends and ongoing buy backs. And going forward really evaluate what's the best economic decision for our shareholders whether that'd be further special dividends or further increases to our buybacks. But increasing the authorization gives us the flexibility to make those decisions along the way.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Egan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thank you. That's all from me.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tracy Jokinen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Andrew Steinerman.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, all. My question is about the cadence for the margin expansion come from 12% to the target 15%, so that's 300 basis points over a two year to four year period of time. Could you give me a sense of the cadence of that, the pace of that. Is there low hanging fruits as it comes to near-term, is that kind of margin expansion, kind of backend loaded where there is sort of big milestones that have to be hit or kind of a stair step function. Just give us a sense of, do you feel like this is a kind of gradual margin expansion over two years to four years or is there any kind of stair steps?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tracy Jokinen</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. I would say it's more towards the gradual, but I alluded to I think 2016 looks challenging and we're working hard to balance investments we make in the business. And when I use the word investments, I'm talking not just about CapEx, but things that immediately hit the P&amp;L, marketing expenditures, adding to the sales force, those kinds of things.</p>
<p>We continue to work hard to balance that with driving near-term performance. So if you look at the capital that we've been spending that - the returns from that capital will be a little further out. So I think 2016 will be a bit of a challenge. And if you think about it as two years to four years, yes, it will probably be a little more backend loaded. But I - as those investments pay-off.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>So I don't it will be a perfectly straight line, Andrew. But on the other hand, I don't see it as big stair steps and a big disconnect anywhere along the line. If you look at what we've done, it's been steady year-after-year finding it in lots of different corners and being able to post improvement as a result and that's largely what we expect to do over the next two years to four years as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p>
<p>Certainly, it makes total sense. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Justin Hauke.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Hauke</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning, guys. Maybe I'll dovetail on top of that question just on the margins. I'm just curious, what was it about 15% that you decided to pick that as your number and just a confidence that you have behind there. And I guess the reason why I ask is, at the end of the day, there is a scale aspect of the margin achievement and 15% would be clearly a very impressive margin in the industry and higher than some peers that are larger than you. So I guess I'm just curious that the confidence you had around that 15% is a round number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I would say the confidence we have is very high. It is a round number and there is a traction in that simplicity. We wanted to go - two years ago when we put our 12 plus out there. We wanted to go for 2015, but we thought it was too much of a stress to us say we were going to jump from 10% to 15%. Now we've put 12% out there, we said we do it in two years to four years and if you give us rounding there, we are essentially there in about two years.</p>
<p>And so, it's our time, we are ready. This team is demonstrated, its ability to put goals out there and deliver, and we like the aggressive bogie, the stretching bogie and being a simple guy, I really like it around. You're right, that there are some scale challenges. We've said that, we've acknowledged that. It just seems that we got to be more clever somewhere else.</p>
<p>And I appreciate that you used the word impressive, and I hope in the next two to four years you'll remember that word just in and pull it back when it's appropriate, because I think the most important thing I can tell you about our 15/5 is when we put our 10/10 goals out there, there was more than one person who kind of look at us [indiscernible] said I don't know and we delivered those in the timeframe we said we would. We've essentially delivered our 12 plus plan in the timeframe we said we would and I think people should be over 15/5 plan exactly in that spirit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Hauke</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, that's a fair question, and you're right. I guess maybe the second part of it is on the growth element. I guess maybe two questions on that, one is, is that conditional on no fundamental change in the market and I mean trends continue at the level that they have the last four or five years and then two, maybe just to kind of give some context, what is kind of the normalized industry growth rate that you see and so does that 5%, does that embed an assumption of share gains or acquisitions are anything on that one?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. So the first point I guess is a conditional on the overall market - the overall economy, short answer to be yes and no. And what I mean by that is we've gone to some pains to point out over the last five or six years. What we've done has been in the phase of a much less than robust economy.</p>
<p>If you look at our Q1, Q2, the end of the last calendar year was the only period I can recall where we felt like we weren't in a headwind. We didn't feel like it was a tailwind, but at least we didn't feel like it was a headwind. And so I would say in one respect it doesn't matter at all because we've proven we can operate independent in the economy. On the other hand if the bottom drops out, the world comes to an end, those kinds of things then yes, I mean even for us it would be hard to work through that. So, that's why I say kind of yes and no, but we choose not to think about or focus on the latter much.</p>
<p>As far as normalized industry growth rate, I mean if you step back, yes, the majors for which was publicly available data have growth rates that aren't all identical, but if you step back far enough, it's a pretty tight range. And so, we think that 5% is kind of right in that range and we'll continue to build and achieve that number through share gains, through new people who've never had a uniform program, never knew the value of uniform program. And hopefully, over at least a two year to four year timeframe, I don't think it's unreasonable for us to be hopeful about the acquisitions story improving to us as well.</p>
<p>So, we see that as kind of in there with an industry range of growth and we believe we'll get there in a multifaceted way.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. That was very helpful. And just one really quick last one, maybe for Tracy here. If you said it on the prepared comments, I missed it, but what was the energy benefit year-over-year to margin this quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tracy Jokinen</span></strong></p>
<p>Our Q4 energy costs were at 3.2% and I think you'll all recall that typically we run around 4% in that area. So, that was one of the main drivers of our operating margin expansion along with continued productivity and gain from leverage. Those two items, while they were significant, they were partially offset by an increase in our merchandising cost and an increase in our health insurance cost, which was driven by higher claims experienced in the quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Hauke</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Thank you, both of you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>You bet.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Chris McGinnis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking my questions and congrats on a good 2015.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Chris. Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>I guess, just to dig in may be in and if you went through this I apologize just on the revenue, may be what was the impact to energy related markets and would you may be if there was a headwind in the quarter, may be could you define it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>We did have a slight headwind in the quarter related to lots of oil and gas wares. And so, on the top line it certainly had an impact. I would say that we were able to overcome natural growth in other areas given the fact that we turned in a 5% top line growth rate. From a benefit perspective, we just spoke about the lower energy cost, which was about 88 point improvement from where our energy cost typically run. So, in the fourth quarter, it was largely positive, if you ask that the loss, whereas against the benefit of lower energy costs.</p>
<p>Going into fiscal 2016, we would expect that lower energy costs will continue to be a benefit in our first quarter but then that will start to mitigate, as we begin to wrap the quarters where we really started to see prices for gas and natural gas begin to decline. [Indiscernible] one more quarter probably of net benefit and then it will be neutral to slightly negative for us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. And then I guess just on the new account growth, are those new to a uniform program, are they coming from somewhere else, from a competitor?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>They're coming from both about - on our the quarter and the full year about 60% of that growth is coming from no programmers. So those that have traditionally not been in uniforms and 40% coming from wining business in the market from competitors.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And one, just one real quick follow-up, if you expand your product portfolio and how would that be accounted for in the revenue line item, would that be - into the add metric? Would that be - would of that how to make it positive? Or would that be just kind of new business itself?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>That would just be new business itself.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. All right. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Does that complete your questions?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Milroy</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Huebschen</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And at this time, there are no further question.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Milroy</strong></p>
<p>Okay, Terese. Thank you. So I'll just summarize again, and where I started with just thank you all for taking the time out of your busy day. We appreciate you to joining us. We were obviously very happy to have a chance to share these results and look forward to talking you again in October about our first quarter and my [indiscernible] and we'll talk to you then, so have a great day. Thanks.</p>
