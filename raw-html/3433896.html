<p>Hi. So, we’re going to keep moving here. I’m Steve Volkmann with Research at Jefferies. I cover machinery, if I haven’t met anybody. Very happy to welcome Caterpillar. We’re going to do this, we have two investor relations folks, Rich Moore and Matt Hohulin will handle the questions and we’re going to do most of this as sort of the fireside chat, but I think Rich, you’re going to do a few opening comments right?</p>
<p><strong>Rich Moore</strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Volkmann</strong></p>
<p>And then we’ll do a little bit of a fireside chat and then we’ll open it up to you guys as well. So thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Rich Moore</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Before we get started I need to cover some details here. Today, we’ll be discussing forward-looking information that involves risks, uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our actual results to differ materially from the forward-looking information. Additional information concerning factors that could cause our results to materially differ can be found in the Risk Factors section of our Form 10-K filed with the SEC and in the forward-looking statements contained in this presentation.</p>
<p>Okay. I’m going to provide a brief recap of our second quarter results from our earnings release on July 23. Sales and revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were $12.3 billion; that’s down from $14.2 billion in the second quarter of last year. Profit per share was $1.16 in the second quarter and that’s a decrease from $1.57 per share a year ago.</p>
<p>Excluding restructuring charges, profit per share was a $1.27 and that was down from $1.69 in the second quarter of last year. All in all, this is above what we expected for the quarter. Just a few highlights from the second quarter. In general, the themes in the quarter were not very different. Strong operational performance around cost management and excellent detrimental margins, in additional to improved quality and safety.</p>
<p>We have a strong balance sheet and generated $1.6 billion of operating cash flow in the second quarter and this supported a 10% increase in our dividend in June and we also announced 1.5 billion stock buyback that will be completed in the third quarter. Sales declined in all regions as many of our end markets and geographies remain very challenged.</p>
<p>Asia-Pacific sales declined 22%, primarily due to lower end user demand for construction and mining equipment and products used in oil and gas applications. In North America, sales decreased 7%, primarily due to lower end user demand for rail applications and construction equipment. </p>
<p>Sales decreased 26% in Latin America, primarily due to lower end user demand and in EAME sales declined 12%, mostly due to unfavorable impact of currency as our sales in euros translated into fewer U.S. dollars. When we take a look at our sales by segment, the story is very similar. Sales in energy and transportation, construction industries, and resource industries were all lower than a year ago.</p>
<p>Also, with our second quarter earnings release, we updated our 2015 outlook. Profit per share outlook for 2015 is unchanged at $4.70 or $5.00, excluding restructuring costs. The outlook for sales and revenues for 2015 is now above $49 billion, which is down $1 billion from the previous outlook.</p>
<p>We originally set the $50 billion sales and revenue estimate in January and our expectations haven’t changed much since then. However, currency impacts from a stronger U.S. dollar are causing sales in many countries to translate into fewer dollars.</p>
<p>What we expect going forward? Economic conditions in the U.S. are modestly positive, but the global economy remains relatively stagnant. Many of the key industries we serve remain weak and we haven’t seen sustained signs of improvement. Continued economic weakness in China and Brazil, as well as uncertainty in the euro zone haven’t helped confidence. Prices for commodities like coal, iron ore and oil are not signaling an improvement in the short-term.</p>
<p>While we’re committed to controlling costs, as we manage through this downturn and that will position Caterpillar for better results when conditions improve. We continue to focus on operational execution and customer success through efforts like lean manufacturing and our across the table initiative with our dealers. Finally, we continue to invest in the future through new technologies innovation and data analytics.</p>
<p>In summary, profit and sales in the second quarter were about as expected. No change in our profit outlook for the year and sales are down about $1 billion, due to the strong U.S. dollar. $1.6 billion of operating cash flow in the second quarter supported a 10% increase in the dividend and $1.5 billion share repurchase to be completed in the third quarter.</p>
<p>And in summary, I think we’ve done a pretty good job with the economic and industry climate that we have to work with. We’ve improved our market position and improved our operations, but we would certainly like to see a better global economy. So, with that Steve, I’ll just stop there and now we can move into Q&amp;A.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q - Steve Volkmann</strong></p>
<p>Good. So, actually a number of people have come up to me during the conference already with some helpful suggestions and things we should discuss up here. So, you might not be a surprised to think the first topic is going to be your oil and gas exposure and what that’s going to look like. And I guess the first question people seem to have is that your E&amp;T margins have held up quite well so far, probably better than a lot of us have expected and I guess the question is how do we think of that going forward, you’re obviously working through some backlog, is that backlog short and we get into the next phase of this, do the margins come down meaningfully from here, how do we think about that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, as we said, we started the year, we had pretty good backlog of recip engines in the oil and gas application throughout about mid-year and so now we’re there right. So that back half of the year, that backlog is largely gone, has been delivered and we haven’t received orders to replace that. So that will be a factor in our sales and profit projection going forward.</p>
<p>One thing I guess to keep in mind when you think about energy and transportation and margins in particular it’s a very diverse segment and we’ve done a pretty good job over the years to narrow the gap I would say between the higher margin products and services and the lower end of that spectrum.</p>
<p>So that gap is now narrowed. We did a very good job of improving margins in our industrial engines, smaller generator sets for example and even our locomotives have been improve margin in those areas over the past several years, so the gap has narrowed and that will obviously play in to the sustainability I would say of the margins. So, we had very strong margins in E&amp;T, certainly in the first quarter and even in second quarter. So, we do expect some headwinds based on product mix, but largely with all of our end markets in Energy and Transportation expected to be down for the year, you do get some offsets from some of the lower margin products versus the higher margin products, so we do expect margins to hold up relatively well in E&amp;T as we go forward through the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So, can you help us think about relative sizing, you talk about the reciprocating engine business to roughly how big a piece of E&amp;T, maybe more of a normalized basis, how much would that be in?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we provided some context that in the past, again it is a little bit dated and the changes of this year will be quite a bit different from what we saw last year right, but just as a relative direction maybe to help steer that a little bit, last year for our oil and gas business in energy and transportation that oil and gas end market was probably about a third, 30% or so let’s say of that E&amp;T business, which would have put it at between 6.5 billion and 7 billion; and it is not exactly this, but it is relatively close to let’s say half and half between recip engines and solar turbines. And the recip engines they are used in applications, primarily drilling and well servicing both onshore and offshore, as well as gas gathering, gas compression, let’s say close to the well head to the first storage location. Whereas solar turbines, again participates in the oil and gas industry, but in very different parts of the industry. It is, primarily I would say used in two applications, gas compression moving natural gas to the interstate pipeline network as well as powering offshore production platforms, oil production platforms. So, again different exposures, probably in general more exposure to natural gas than oil and longer project type applications as opposed to shorter cycle drilling and well servicing applications.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So we’ve through the backlog on recip now, are you getting any new orders in that type of business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>Very few, if any. I think again that, again we are talking it is a global business, but most of this that we are talking about is North America, but our backlog has come down and the relative positioning of what’s been delivered versus what we are getting in as new orders is quite different. So, I’m not going to say we haven’t received any orders because we probably have, but on a relative basis very few.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So then switching to solar…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>And again I just want to clarify one thing that’s primarily for the drilling and well servicing areas. You know gas gathering, once you have a producing well you do still need to have engines that would be used close to the well head married up with the compressor that would move that gas through the pipeline. So that part of the business I think is better than the drilling and the well servicing part. So, the orders that we may be receiving for the recip engines, I would say would probably be more related to the gas gathering and compression than it would be to the drilling and well servicing area.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>And I would add to that Steve. When we put the initial forecast for sales together with our fourth quarter result in January, you know our prediction for sales in this business are playing out pretty much exactly how we thought it would. So, we came through the end of the year. There were some cancellations that took place in late December, early January, but as we got prepared to talk about our outlook for 2015, we went back to the dealers and customers we betted them the backlog that we had and in fact what’s happened over the first and second quarter played out pretty much as we had expected at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So, no further cancellations.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore </span></strong></p>
<p>There were some other cancellations that took place through the remaining days of the first and second quarter, but predominantly it was taken care of in the first let’s say two weeks of January.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>And then switching to solar the turbine business, I guess that sort of the longer cycle business, so you still have some backlog that you’re working through, but how should we think about end market dynamic there, is it going to end up sort of like recips that we sort of fall off at some point or not…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>There is a lot differences that you need to kind of take into concentration when you compare turbines with the recip engines, you mentioned one into different part of the industry to production type of environment, you know gas pipelines and offshore production platforms, so the gas, the build-out of the infrastructure for natural gas is still going pretty well. It’s driven by higher demand for natural gas, utilities, LNG facilities, petrochemical facilities, so that’s all going still fairly well and we would expect at least for the foreseeable future there is no signs right now that that’s running into any major problems.</p>
<p>Also, on production platforms, if it’s an installed turbine also on the pipeline, those don’t really change much with short term moves in commodity prices. So, Solar’s business, a big part of their business we don’t provide the breakdown, but a big part of their business is aftermarket and it’s a direct to market model so they capture all the customer services work and maintenance and repair, not only the parts and components but the labor side of that as well, and that’s fairly stable through the cycle. So again it’s a production environment, so the turbines continue to operate and need to operate, so that part of the business is much more stable through the cycle. So it’s a very different dynamic when you think about the cycles that Solar participates in versus the recip engine.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So offshore field is very weak I guess to us and I know you have exposure there with Solar. Talk us through how to think about that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>I think the weakness that you might be seeing is partly related to IOC and NLC [ph] comments about CapEx spend. But again, their view on oil production, they are taking a 20 year, 30 year, 40 year, 50 year view of production capacity that they need to have online and so it is a different investment thesis than maybe onshore drilling and shorter cycle. I’m not saying that it won’t be down going forward because of $40 to $60 oil, but again it’s a different investment thesis on what’s it is going to be as far as the production side of their business. And we are well positioned in that market as far as market share for offshore production platform. But that is probably if you kind of bifurcate down Solar’s business to get to the first fit turbine deliveries on new construction of offshore production platform, that’s probably where the risk is of lower oil prices to some degree. I mean it’s probably not going to go to zero in that industry but if there is any decline there, that’s probably where Solar might see some pressure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>And any rough order magnitude have much of Solar is exposed to that dynamic?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>Nothing that we really can look on that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. And then notwithstanding, maybe you can just kind of review what’s happened in case of if you are not familiar with the locomotives sort of the cadence of that product availability.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>On locomotives, we are expecting to produce and ship [indiscernible] locomotives to North American customers in the last half of 2016. We are taking orders. We have some units that are on test. We’ve actually have a firm order for shipments in 2016 as well as in 2017, and I would say that things are progressing as planned.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So as this ramps up in 2016, is that sort of a slow ramp or does the second half of 2016 get back up to normal volume fairly quickly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to move that forward as quickly as we can. Our expectation is that we will be shipping them in the last half and we will move it up if we can to disposal to move it up. But in terms of the shipments in 2016, it would be based on what the customer requirements are. So if there is a big demand for shipments in the latter half of 2016, we could deliver that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>And it sounds like you are saying you have a little backlog building but not a lot yet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>We took a fairly sizeable order in the first quarter to a backlog for shipment in 2016 and 2017.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>And have you guys said what the average selling price of the newer locomotives, the difference versus the older ones?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>We have not announced that yet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right. Good. So that’s kind of E&amp;T. Maybe talk a little bit about the construction business as well because I think many of us expected things to be weak in resource and E&amp;T this year, but maybe construction had a chance to offset that and that hasn’t been particularly strong either. So maybe you can sort of talk to the dynamics of the different end markets for construction equipment and why we are not seeing given that housing and commercial at least is above zero which [indiscernible] why aren’t we seeing some benefit from that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>I think North America, particularly talking about North America, I think we know we can cover the other regions but again I think the main activity in a world right now, construction land is in North America. Europe is doing okay, but I think the relative strength that we are seeing around the world will be primarily in North America. And I think that’s going – it’s going kind of okay and not great. Part of that is I think as we talked about in the year end release and initial outlook for 2015, there are headwinds in North America related to oil and gas. We had to try to quantify what that might be. We talked about indirect exposure to oil and gas, some of that is in construction North America related to the road building, the drill site preparation and that’s actually playing out to a certain degree.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you remind us how much that was?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m not sure – for North America specifically we didn’t quantify it. We can talk about half of the sales decline overall from 14% to 15% was related to oil and gas both direct and indirect, but I don’t recall that is broken down by region. The indirect piece is really very hard to quantify. It’s everything from we had to take a view on oil producing countries. How much of their infrastructure spend would be cut back because of lower oil prices and I think we made a good attempt and so far it’s playing out pretty well based on our original outlook and forecast. </p>
<p>But for the North America piece, we know that from certainly 2012, 2013, and particularly 2014, there has been a sizeable build out of roads and frac sites and well servicing areas and drilling sites over that time period, and some of that activity – recent activity not growing right now. We knew that, that was going to have an impact so quantified a portion of that and we’re seeing that play out. What we are hearing from our dealers is that, the other parts of the industry, residential, non-residential, commercial is doing better and that is offsetting a lot of the headwinds that we are seeing in the oil and gas piece of construction.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So those end markets are up for you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>And what’s your sense of kind of average fleet age in the construction industries I guess in North America more specifically?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t have any specific numbers on that but just some thoughts really since probably Matt maybe middle of 2011 I would say we’ve been through the excess from the peak in 2006, 2007 from the decline from the recession in 2008. We kind of got back to I would say normal replacement level in the industry and probably the second half of 2011 or so. So since then, I think there has been the economy has grown very slowly, it’s been primarily a replacement with very modest growth in the industry over the time period. So a lot of our – the vast majority of our sales to dealers have primarily been for the replacement cycle.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>You know, Steve, I think that’s the key point where we would see growth in our construction industry and the business is the regional GDP was in excess of 2.5% and we just haven’t seen that since we come out of the recovery.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>How hopeful would a highway build be?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>We looked at the industry impacts that might have. It varies quite a bit by product, certainly road construction equipment, paving equipment would probably the biggest manufacturers of that. But in general, we’ve taken a look at how the industry might increase and it’s a few points to maybe mid-single digit improvement in the industry and certainly we would participate in that. so it’s meaningful and I think not only due to the equipment that would be needed for some of those projects, but it also gives confidence in contracts and it just helps them to – you might see some shifts if that happens as you get – as contracts get a longer run way view of their backlog of work, you might see some movement and shifts from rental to sales. </p>
<p>We would really see much of an impact of that. That’s really a shift within the industry and our dealers participate in both rental and obviously new deliveries. So whether we are delivering the equipment right now that goes into dealer rental fleet or they are delivering equipment that they sell on to customers, it’s still a sale from us to the dealer so we might not see as much of a dynamic between the shifting of rental to sales. But certainly the industry we would expect it to grow and that would be beneficial for us for sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>We don’t have long term highway bill extension included in our forecast for 2015. [indiscernible] we are hopeful but let’s see.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>And then the construction I guess is the business where you have certainly the most diffuse number of global competitors. Some of them have other currency basics. Are you seeing any increased competitiveness from any of those guys?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. I think in a word, yes. If you think about when I just spoke about a minute ago, the most active construction equipment market right now is North America and you can even probably boil that down and say just U.S. And so all of the major participants are focused on that market because that’s where lot of the activity is. That naturally creates a competitive environment in addition to what it always has been is a very competitive environment because of all the players. There is a good competition of products in that area. You feel on top of that competitors that are heavy into the ag industry, that’s off right now. They are probably incrementally a little bit more focused on construction. You saw competitors that have either a Euro or a Japanese Yen based cost structure more than what we have. That adds another layer of potential competitiveness. </p>
<p>So you fill these on top of each other and it’s a very competitive environment. So far, we’ve done well, pricing has remained positive, market share is holding in there and we’re doing everything we can to maintain and grow that. So it’s a battlefield and our dealers are on the frontline of battling. Our Cat Financial’s is helping on the frontlines battling with competition to win business, but I think that that’s the environment we are in for the near term.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So do you think we should think about pricing as being potentially negative going forward or we try to model this out?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>There is different ways to look at that. We are very focused on maintaining and growing our market share. That’s a key element to our business strategy of having field population and growing that field population that supports the ongoing aftermarket and service work. As we have taken out cost and done better on our operational efficiencies that I talked about earlier, we’ve used some of those savings to remain very competitive in the marketplace as well. So we don’t expect pricing – even the positive price that we’ve been getting in the marketplace has been very modest, and we would expect that to continue. We are focused on the remain as competitive as we can and to maintain that market share base.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>So maybe shifting I have a question quite often about the potential for another large layer of restructuring as we think about, you may or may not agree but some people think mining is sort of going to be impaired for a number of years and oil and gas is going in the same direction, and you guys have done a pretty good job with keeping on top of the cost side but maybe there is an opportunity to take a real big swipe at the cost structure again giving us end market environment. How do you think about that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>Steve, we’ve actually done quite a bit on restructuring. If you go back to beginning of 2013, we’ve taken almost $1 billion in restructuring charges. A lot of that has been related to mining. In fact my understanding is the employment is down 40% from where it was in the peak. We’ve consolidated a number of smaller facilities within that business and even just recently we announced that we are working to consolidate the campuses at Aurora which is a large manufacturing facility outside of Chicago as well as the South Milwaukee, the former Bucyrus kind of headquarters. There is a number of things that can do in a low volume environment to consolidate those campuses and just make them more efficient. So we’ve actually done a fairly large amount of restructuring within that business. </p>
<p>We are continuing to look at what else can be done, but as we’ve described before you’ve got a situation where at the bottom of the economic cycle, it would be a challenge to – let’s use large mining trucks as an example. That’s a sole source for 150 ton and larger trucks, there’s four assembly lines there that each one is dedicated to a specific product and they’re intensely setup to be scalable up and down as we go through these cycles because they’re with us forever. And so we’ve scaled those assembly lines back to current production levels, we’ve taken out fair number of employees along the way as we scaled that back, but if you were to remove one of those assembly lines for example you’d save a little bit in depreciation costs, one that came in time that are producing another 797 [ph] truck, you wouldn’t have the capability to do it. So, from our perspective we’ve done quite a bit and we are continuing to look at it in ways we can take cost out of the business so that when the volume does come back we’re better prepared to do or even improved profitability from where we were at before, but at this stage of the cycle it’d be really a challenge to and maybe not so intelligent to take out more of the capacity that’s there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>And I would just add something to that too Steve is that our focus within all of our businesses is based on OPAC curves that we talked about operating profit after capital charge and that OPAC curve is basically the incremental and detrimental margin slope for that business and so as volumes change the expectation for volumes up or down, those businesses have to pull whatever levers they need to, to make sure they stay on those incremental and detrimental curves. So, that’s really what ultimately drives those decisions and you have to have obviously a view of the industry, where it’s going, the pace of the growth and all that, that’s kind of the economic a macro factor of your industry, but at the end of the day, we’re designing our processes to be scalable up and down so that these businesses can stay on their incremental and detrimental curves.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>And I think too with mining right now and where it’s at where we’re producing, our competition is producing, the industry’s producing at a level that is significantly less than even replacement demand. Our facilities are set up to produce a certain number of trucks and we have to at least have enough to be able to support that replaceable level demand when in fact it comes back because their depreciable assets that are working out in the field and quite honestly production levels in the mines has been increasing over the last several years and as long as the trucks are being worked, they’re going to have to be replaced.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Volkmann</span></strong></p>
<p>Probably have time for one or two from the audience if anybody wants to - yeah.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible Question]</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s a pretty broad question but I think in construction equipment, the industry, particularly excavators, which is they do report out from China on excavator sales and that has been on a downward trend, quite a steep downward trend since 2011 and that is continuing this year. It’s down quite a bit, our market share is continuing to - we’re continuing to improve our market share there so our sales is down less than the overall industry and we would expect that to continue as far as gaining share there. There’s still a lot of participants in the construction equipment industry, lot of competitors there, lot of local competitors, probably over time there will be a need for more consolidation of participants there. So, that’s something that we would expect over time to see, but right now we’re performing very well.</p>
<p>We’re pleased with our performance there in a very, very challenging environment and that’s really a function of kind of the complete execution of our business model, product strategy, dealer strategy, cap financial, the whole process that we used everywhere else in the world is working well. In China, customers are seeing value in our kind of a model, the full service lifecycle type cost focus with dealer support and parts inventory and rental and use and the whole gamut that customers can utilize so that process is playing out in China. Right now, we’re winning in that very depressed market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible Question]</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>That comment was primarily related to excavators, as far as the overall industry being down, but it expands beyond that. Our participation if you think about the projects that are continuing to be done and worked in China, it is more on infrastructure development than it would be on residential high-rise buildings or residential construction. And I would say generally speaking that’s probably more into our real house and sweet spot, medium to large equipment for roads, rail ports, water treatment, utility, and construction. Those areas where there is still activity going on in the economy more so than residential that probably plays to our strength as well, as far as where we participate best in the marketplace.</p>

<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>Well this, I think the numbers we just saw the other day Matt was down 30%?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. That’s what the public data says, yeah.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>In the 30s...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matt Hohulin</span></strong></p>
<p>If I recall please correct me, but I think at its peak China was sort of 4% or 5% in revenue and now it’s probably a fraction of that, right. So, it is probably...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>It is less than that now, yes.</p>

<p>One more?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Just given everything that is going on in the coal industry, you briefly mentioned Bucyrus, what’s the balance sheet risk to having to take some sort of impairment charge on the Bucyrus acquisition and how often is that reviewed now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rich Moore</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s a good question. Actually it’s detailed in our 10-K that we published back in February. It’s a process that we do annually starting in October and we don’t just do it of course for Bucyrus we do for all of our acquisitions. We go through a do a goodwill impairment test. So the last time we did it was in the fourth quarter of 2014. The next one will be coming up October 1, 2015.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Volkmann</strong></p>
<p>With that I think we are out of time. Are we doing a breakout session following this, or not?</p>
<p><strong>Rich Moore</strong></p>
<p>No just the one on one.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Volkmann</strong></p>
<p>No, okay. Good.</p>
