<p><strong>Nick Tavlarios</strong></p>
<p>Good morning and welcome to Aegean Marine's second quarter 2015 conference call. I am Nick Tavlarios, President of Aegean; and on the call with me today is Peter Georgiopoulos, Chairman of Aegean; and Spyros Gianniotis, CFO of Aegean.</p>
<p>Before we begin our presentation, I would like to note that this conference call will contain forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Words such as expects, anticipates, intends, estimates, or similar expressions are intended to identify these forward-looking statements. These statements are based on Aegean Marine Petroleum Network, Inc.'s current plans and expectations, and involve risks and uncertainties that could cause future activities and the results of operations to be materially different from those set forth in the forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>Important factors that could cause actual results to differ include our future operating or financial results, our ability to manage growth, adverse conditions in the marine field supply industries, and increased levels of competition. For further information, please refer to Aegean Marine Petroleum Network, Inc.'s reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>I would like to begin with an overview of our performance during the second quarter; I will then review developments within our specific business as well as the broader industry that have been drivers in our operational financial results.</p>
<p>Once I’ve walked through high level overview of our performance, I will provide details of our financial results for the second quarter. I will then conclude the call by discussing macro trends within the shipping industry, and the positive trends that will help us to continue to grow our company and our bottom line through the second half of 2015.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, our business faced some unforeseen expenses in two temporary headwinds that impact our financial results. Sustain low oil prices and a disruption in one of our larger markets. Sustain lower pricing environment, load barrier to entry into the market allowing competitors to aggressively offer an incremental sales that will always be beyond their credit capacity. These increased competitiveness have resulted in a tighter margin environment that has made an impact across the industry.</p>
<p>Despite headwinds, Aegean extended its track record of profitability in the quarter, which marks our 18<sup>th</sup> consecutive quarter of profitability. We have now achieved this goal in 33 of 34 quarters, since becoming a public company. This sustained success is a result of our differentiated strategy that separates ourselves from our peers.</p>
<p>Financial flexibility is a main stay of our success and our strong balance sheet differentiates Aegean from its competition, which I will discuss later on in the call. Looking ahead, we continue to take steps to ensure we are well positioned regardless of the economic environment. Fort the second quarter of 2015, we delivered solid results despite the difficult economic environment achieving total sales volume of 3,150,950 million metric tons; a gross profit of $78.5 million, down approximately 7% over the same period in 2014; adjusted operating income of $14.8 million, 23.3% QoverQ down, but adjusted net income of $7.1 million or $0.15 basic and diluted earnings per share for the second quarter. And despite these challenges we experienced in the quarter, we continue to successfully execute in our strategy focused on successfully leveraging our global network and the supporting growth drivers we establish.</p>
<p>Aegean remains uniquely positioned with a global network covering 31 markets across four regions North America and the Caribbean, Middle East and Mediterranean, Northwest Europe and the Far East. This geographic diversification has allowed us to remain competitive in these large markets. Shipping remained strong throughout each of these regions, particularly in North America and the Caribbean, where we experienced strong growth that bolster our results in the quarter.</p>
<p>In Fujairah, our storage facility continues to perform well. The storage facility is operating at strong efficiency levels and is now at about 86% capacity. This success was driven by our strong marketing strategy remain on track to achieve our stated goal of 100% lease rate by the end of 2015. Fujairah continued to contribute to our EBITDA for the quarter that will meaningfully contribute in the going forward quarters.</p>
<p>In addition, we received an outstanding review from the Maritime and Port Authority Fujairah on the terminals performance, another sign of the facility strength. On the physical supply side, two additional load points will be opened by the end of quarter and current year. We expect our sales volume Fujairah to materially increase. Demand in this market is quite strong.</p>
<p>I also want to provide an update on the market in Greece and its impact on Aegean. From a capital perspective, we are not affected by the current environment in Greece. Our business conducted in US dollars and with the diverse group of international banks. From an operational perspective the Greek market has seen some minor impacts, but it continues to be a good market for the company overall. </p>
<p>As stated earlier, sustained lower oil price have provided the company, or have brought the opportunity for some smaller less flow capital suppliers compete per share in certain market. This was particularly noticeable in Northwest Europe. To increase efficiency in this region, we will be winding down of Portland terminal and this and all operations will now be covered by Northwest Europe office. We expect this adjustment to realize a few million dollars in annual cost savings as a result. </p>
<p>While there were no sales of vessels during the quarter, we will continue to pursue the most efficient use of our capital and improvement of utilization of our remaining fleet, by reduced maintenance CapEx. We're focused on maintaining our competitive advantage in order to capitalize on future opportunities as the market environment improves and continue to look for more efficient and profitable ways to generate growth and expand our geographical footprint.</p>
<p>To that point, we are currently pursuing several avenues to drive sustainable profitability and growth as we continue to execute our strategy. This includes entrance into new markets through low cost start-up opportunities as evidenced by our recent expansions. Each of these initiatives is in line with our strategy focused on being in position of strength as the markets continue to normalize allowing us to respond to increased market demand.</p>
<p>Moving to our capital allocation strategy, we are proud of our ability to generate significant levels of free cash. In the past, we have reinvested in the capital back into our business to enhance operations and created strong platforms for long-term sustainable growth. As our business continues to grow free cash, the board and management will and as we always have continued to assess our capital allocation priorities.</p>
<p>Our focus remains on deploying our cash to drive the most significant stockholder returns. As such we will consider all options to achieve this objective, including ongoing reinvestment, share repurchases, and dividend increases, as well as other opportunities to deliver shareholder value. We also work to further strengthen our balance sheet and ensure that we continue to support our growth plan. We are confident that with this financial strength and by continuing to execute our proven strategy, we will generate value for our shareholders and position our company for continued growth.</p>
<p>I will now provide some additional detail on the financial results for the quarter. As you know since market conditions fluctuate at ports around the world, we provide sequential comparisons in order to discuss our quarterly financial results comparing results for the second quarter 2015 to the first quarter 2015.</p>
<p>For the second quarter, our sales volumes increased by 8.1% to approximately 3.2 million metric tons on a sequential basis, 2.95 million metric tons of which was physical supply with the balance being made up of marketed back to back sales. During the second quarter, the gross spreads per metric ton of marine fuel sold was $22.5, a decrease of 6.6% over Q1 levels. Total gross profit for the second quarter decreased by 2.7% sequentially to $78.5 million. Net income for the second quarter was $7.1 million or $0.15 per basic and diluted share. EBITDA for the second quarter was $24.1 million.</p>
<p>Utilization of our physical supply fleet, which as a reminder does not include Aegean Northwest Europe or US East Coast or West Coast and Gulf operations and our Hamburg business, is measured as volumes related per vessel per day excluded both schedule and non-scheduled, non-operating or off hire days. It was 545 metric tons per day, compared to 530 metric tons per vessel per day in the first quarter 2015.</p>
<p>We generate volumes revenues of $6.1 million in the second quarter. This figure was approximately $2 million lower than our original forecast due to dry docking requirements for chartered vessels. Looking ahead, we expect these voyage revenues to increase. We expect storage levels to increase as we lease greater storage capacity to third parties at our Fujairah facility.</p>
<p>On the expense side, our fuel consumption cost increased approximately $1.7 million to the approximate 11% rise in fuel costs. On slide 10, we present our historical gross profit in the EBITDA margin trends. Our EBITDA margin, which is calculated as EBITDA divided by gross profit, was 30.6% in Q2, a decrease of 11% over the previous quarter.</p>
<p>During the quarter, Aegean reported net cash used in operations of $59.3 million as trade receivables expanded from $363.3 million to $420 million; and inventory grew from $176 million to $206 million through a 8.1% quarter-on-quarter increase in sales volume, and almost 11% increase in fuel prices. As of June 30, 2015, our cash position was $42.4 million and our working capital position was $267.7 million.</p>
<p>Our total debt of $740.6 million can be analyzed as follows. Our fixed asset base of $630.7 million is financed by $211.8 million in debt, $38.8 million of which is classified as current, which implies leverage of 33.6%. Our $528.8 million in working capital debt, $233.4 million long-term, and $295.4 million in short-term both of which combine finance current assets of $750.7 million, resulting in leverage of approximately 70%.</p>
<p>As you know, our current assets are very liquid and our inventories are turned over every 16 and our receivables every 31 days. Our debt can be further analyzed as follows. Our fixed that asset debt of $211.8 million secured by 36 vessels, all built after in 2007. This means that we have $5.9 million of debt per vessel with an average vessel age of seven years. We own an additional 12 vessels that are debt free. All financing is committed in attractive rates. We have set a $73.5 million term loan financing our storage in Fujairah with a book value of over $223 million. All term debt is also committed. </p>
<p>We continue to enhance our considerable financial flexibility, which remains a key differentiator to Aegean. We are also pleased to announce a successful refinancing of our $250 million U.S. facility with the ability to expand it to $300 million. We have a strong balance sheet that can support continued growth over the long term and we appreciate the continued support of these banks and their confidence and Aegean Marine’s business model. </p>
<p>As of June 30, 2015, our fixed asset debt to adjusted EBITDA multiple was approximately 2.1 times, significantly lower than many peers who have consistently over levered in the difficult market. Our financial liquidity which includes more than $1.8 billion of working capital credit facilities including supplier credit. We are in compliance with all loan covenants and have a strong fixed debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio. </p>
<p>I’ll now turn the call over to Peter Georgiopoulos for closing comments.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Georgiopoulos</strong></p>
<p>Our second quarter results demonstrate our ability to deliver returns in a variety of market conditions as a result of our strong global platform. While we faced headwinds during the quarter, we remain well positioned due to our unique and dynamic business model. For the month of July, our sales volume grew approximately 1,050,000 metric tons. Before opening the call to Q&amp;A, I want to outline some of the emerging macro trends in our industry and detail why we believe we are positioned to continue to successfully navigate industry challenges and capitalize on positive shifts in the market landscape.</p>
<p>Market dynamics in the shipping environment continue to improve steadily. The commodity price environment has had an impact on the entire industry as sustainable oil prices have led to increased competition. As we continue to the second half of 2015, we are confident that overall fundamentals in the maritime industry will gradually improve as well. As the regulations in our industry continue to change specifically in fuel content requirements, we remain focused on leveraging our diversified approach to maintain a competitive advantage. With strong cash flow, we are well capitalized with limited debt and vessels that can support multiple fuel grades. As a result, we are not facing any issues under these regulations and are confident that we will be able to gain profitable market share as our competitors exit the market.</p>
<p>Despite challenges, we are entering the second half of 2015 with several growth drivers in place that we expect will allow us to further improve our financial performance. Aegean’s global brand diversified across four regions and 31 markets and world class marine logistics platform position us well for the markets continued improvement. Our strong balance sheet will continue to support our growth plan and our core operations around the world. As a result, we feel well positioned to capitalize on market opportunities.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, we continue to focus on evaluating more efficient and profitable ways to execute our proven strategy. As fundamentals continue to improve, we are poised to benefit from our expanded global market operations, diversifying our business and advancing our position in the global fuel supply market. We remain committed to delivering value to our shareholders enhancing our network by opportunistically expanding our global footprint and ensuring customers are even better equipped to run their business around the world.</p>
<p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to questions. Operator?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] We will have our first question from Doug Mavrinac with Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, operator. Good morning guys. I just had a handful of question this morning. With the first view on the second quarter because there seems to be a lot of moving parts that carve them out to one-off items but I just wanted to make sure that I have it clear. So Nick, in your commentary, in terms of sales volumes for the quarter, you mentioned that total volumes grew 3.2 million tons and your physical sales volumes were 2.9 such that there is about 250,000 or so million barrels of marketed back-to-back volumes. Now, when you look at those marketed back-to-back volumes, what sort of spread are you earning on them and if it’s a lower than average spread, what sort of impact would that have had on your overall gross spread for the quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Doug. So those marketed back-to-back sales are done at a significantly lower spread than the physical supply volume which is our core business. So, yes, they do have an effect on what that gross spread looks like if you were to sort of adjust that spread, it will probably a $1 higher just physical supply volumes there. They’re done at a much, much higher margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Got you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>But again, the other interesting thing is, those back-to-back – they are asset like deals, they have a very – there is very little cost involved in doing those, they have a very high operating margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. So if we are looking at kind of your physical sales volume, you were at least in line with 1Q and even if you kind of look at the real spread that you made, it should be closer to 23.50 and sort of 22.50 with this kind of in line with 1Q as well. Is that the right way to look at it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. That’s right, Doug. We will be close to that figure. Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Now, on that topic before shifting gears, were there any vessels that you had off hired during 2Q that could have even contributed further towards the sales volumes that you had?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. We had two vessels that we chartered out to third parties and those vessels were in dry dock where close to 60 days. So the voyage revenues I think I commented on is certainly or actually $2 million lower but the expense was there. So what you see is $2 million in missing voyage revenue. So in essence, our income would be about $2 million higher had they not been on dry dock.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Got you. So volumes were at least as good as 1Q, spread in line with 1Q and you could have had some upside if those things would have been operating.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. And then just final question on the second quarter before looking at how this is all going to impact 3Q, in terms of the own fuel consumption, you mentioned that $1.7 million hit, is that solely due to the fact that we saw spike in oil prices in 2Q that has subsequently come down?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. If you look at the year and I’ll go away from bunker fuel for a second and just talk about crude oil. I think if you remember in Q1, crude hovered around the low 50s and by Q2 it kind of got close to $60, high 50s and now in Q3 we see it into the 40s even right, but certainly averaging somewhere around high 40s. While bunker fuel correlating to crude oil has had that same experience, so what’s happened for the consumption of our own fleet in Q2 going from Q1, we did have a $1.7 million rise in our expenses. Since then in Q3 of course you would expect that number to move downward, again given the fact that fuel is gotten so much cheaper in Q3.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. Perfect. Okay, great. And that’s the perfect kind of segway to my next set of questions. On the third quarter, in terms of the sales volume update, Peter mentioned that you had over 1 million tons for July. Is any of that or how much of that can you quantify at this point, would any of that be some of those marketed back-to-back volumes?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. There is about 70,000 tons of marketed back-to-back volumes in that 1,050,000.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>So just under 1 million in terms of the physical volumes which is kind of in line with 1Q and 2Q?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Got you. And then in terms of the spread environment, Nick, in this lower oil environment with the increased competition that you’ve referenced, 23.50 was kind of the spread number for 1Q, 23.50 was kind of the spread number for 2Q, is that kind of what you’re seeing on some of those volumes thus far in 3Q or is it too early to tell in terms of what your overall profitability is on those?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Before we even get exact, let’s just point out, I could said in my comments the competition phenomenon is going on mainly in the large markets. It’s not Aegean has a very diverse number of ports it serves in terms of their characteristics. You see that in the largest markets in the world like the northwest Europe or maybe even Singapore. That’s where that kind of thing appears with a lot of competitors and a lot of licenses. So the smaller market does not quite – we are not feeling that same effect. So, yes, obviously a low price environment or low oil price environment I should say definitely creates that opportunity. And so there is – it makes a little harder to get the higher margin that you would get.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. But at the same time it also helps on your fuel consumption line, right. So my last question in terms of 3Q on fuel consumption, with crude prices and bunker fuel prices coming off not just from 2Q levels but really coming off significantly, when you look at your own fuel consumption, your expectations, do you view it as being likely more in line with 1Q or obviously 2Q, but is 1Q in terms of the run rate probably okay for our 3Q thoughts?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>I would say that’s a conservative figure, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Mavrinac</span></strong></p>
<p>All right, perfect. That’s actually very, very helpful, Nick. Thanks for the time.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We’ll go next to Ben Nolan, Stifel.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. I had a few I guess strategy questions. You talked a lot about low barrier to entries, or constantly lower oil prices, and was just curious, is that also impacting your ability to say grow your volumes and I realize that grown is function of the back-to-back sales, but they don’t seem to be material – if you look at the physical side, they don’t seem to be materially higher than they were prior to the OW acquisitions. Is that – are you losing some share in some market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>I think, Ben, what you’re seeing is we’re being very selective about what volume we’re going to sell. And Peter, do you want to add something?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Georgiopoulos</span></strong></p>
<p>And there is competition in ports. In some of the ports where OW was, when OW blew up, the team that was there sort of set up their own business and so we’ve got a new company that we’re competing against. I think that’s what happened in some of the ports. We had hoped they would go away, OW went away but were replaced by someone else. And so I think that’s why you’re seeing some of the volume sort of staying relatively flat. Most of the growth has been from new ports that we’ve taken, that we took over from OW.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And then sort of in line with that, another thing that we’ve been looking towards maybe some impact on the spread from blending and because of the new sulfur regulations. Again is that being hidden by the increased level of competition or is that spread or fueling requirement causing spread to be higher but not really happening?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it’s probably hidden most by the lower oil price. You’re not going to see as much of a benefit. Not long ago, gas oil was $800 a ton and about a year ago it was $1,200 a ton. So it’s come down to some, now its $500 a ton for gas oil. So again, if gas oil gets back to a normalized level around $700 to $800 a ton, yes, we’re going to capture bigger margins on that, on that 0.1% sulfur fuel, there is no doubt about it and that goes across the board. I mean there is definitely going to be a little bit more money to be made.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That’s helpful. And then circling around to the Fujairah stuff, it’s good to see that its coming pretty close to full capacity. Just curious if you could maybe put a number on how much the EBITDA contribution the Fujairah they had in the quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>I think we are still on track to see Fujairah getting to its $15 million level that we spoke off, right. So $15 million you are talking about, somewhere around $1.20 to $1.25 per month. So on that basis, again, you’re going to be somewhere in that whole neighborhood of – let’s just say $3 million a quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And could you remind me what sort of the other [indiscernible] P6 (3:40) aspect of it, how much of a contribution you would expect as a function of being able to improve your own business there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>We certainly expect to do higher volumes in Fujairah and we expect to be able to generate a better gross spread than we did in the past. I could tell you the demand in Fujairah right now is very strong. The port is quite congested. They are opening up an additional two loading points, one is being done in the current quarter as I said and the other one early next year. As that happens, we expect the volumes in Fujairah to ramp up significantly, our sales to increase there and we will be able to use that terminal in a way we can capture greater profit margin. Blender's margin from engaging in blending is somewhere between $5 and $10 a ton on every ton that’s done from blended fuel. So as we begin to overlay that into our product mix there, we would expect our performance in that ports to further improve.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just two quick ones, so the cash conversion cycle looks like it has slowed a bit in receivable sometime as spread. Any reason for that or is it something that you might see compress again?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Spyros.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Spyros Gianniotis</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, actually Ben, days receivables is relatively flat. 29 days last quarter was 73 days, this quarter is 30 days. What has changed is inventory from 12 days to 16 days. And this is mainly due to the US business where we have six storages on the East Coast and the other storage on the West Coast, plus one big vessel in the US Gulf. So, this is where you see the cost conversion cycle change.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And it is probably likely to stay at these levels, a fair assumption?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Spyros Gianniotis</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then lastly, would obviously seems to win customer share price and to the extent that we were to continue to see some weakness, how do you guys feel about buying back potentially some shares, I mean given your outlook for the trajectory of the business that might soon to be a good opportunity to do something like that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>Again, well I think we spoke about our capital allocation strategy in our comments earlier. Certainly leaving our company, it is a very company and we got a very good runway ahead of us. We think that there’s a lot of good things that are going to come. So…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Georgiopoulos </span></strong></p>
<p>And of course the board will look at that as an option.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ben Nolan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right very good. Thanks a lot guys.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We’ll go next to Kevin Sterling, BB&amp;T Capital Markets. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good morning gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning Kevin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>Nick. Looking at your back to back sales, do you envision these sales growing from current levels or are you kind of happy where you are with your back-to-back business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>I think they could grow a bit given Kevin. There is no doubt about it. They could definitely grow big. We’re taking care of some key customers and looking after to their interest. It is not the primary part of our business. We are a physical supplier that’s how we find ourselves, but they could definitely grow a little bit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And so basically I guess customers, it sounds like customers tell to you guys that hey we want to do this with you, would you offer the services, is that kind of how this came about maybe operating back-to-back in ports where you don’t have physical supply?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>That’s correct. That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>In ports where we have physical supply that is what we do. We present ourselves as the physical supplier and not as a back-to-back marketing entity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Lastly, I think and I missed it, I’m sorry to Ben’s question, I think you talked about your inventories increasing this quarter in the balance sheet, was that related to US, the US business or is that Fujairah or for both, I’m sorry I missed that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>As Spyros said, it is mainly due to the US business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>[Indiscernible] </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>We take inventories on the US East Coast and we've also taken inventories in the West Coast, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>And so as we think about that business going forward you should kind of continue to expect model higher inventory levels, is that right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>Correct, correct. Again that number will fluctuate based on the value of the commodity too.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Okay. And then the last question here, most of my questions have been answered, just kind of a bigger picture the smaller gas that you see pop-up, do you think they would hit a ceiling where they can’t grow much more because you don’t have the capital and if you see there is some pressure right now from [indiscernible] that imagine they are going to get to a point where they don’t have the access to capital that you guys have and don’t have the ability to grow, is that kind of how you are seeing the business and maybe look at some of the competition?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. I absolutely see that that will be the case. And the reason is that’s just; and I will do a simple example for you, if they have $4 million of credit established somewhere and oil is at $250 a ton, they can go out and get extra number, whatever that translates to in volume. But if oil goes to say from the $252 to $400 a ton which it was not too long ago, right, it compresses the amount of volume they can take out of the market. Right, so it absolutely has a direct impact on them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, yes they just don’t have the access to capital liquidity that you guys have is that right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>Correct. They do not have that advantage and we have so much spare capacity that definitely translates to less competition for us. Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Sterlin</span></strong></p>
<p>I got you. Okay, well that’s all I have, thanks so much for your time this morning gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>Alright, Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] We will go next to [indiscernible] with Sidoti.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Nick, you mentioned that you are planning to cut cost in the North European markets; can you provide a range as to what we are looking at?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, well the first thing we done is we’ve turned back are, we’ve closed down our Portland operation and let’s just say that will translate to around $3 million to $ 4 million in savings, per year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And that will be immediately?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios </span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>And then in addition to that [indiscernible] there is certain other initiatives where if there is an inefficiency within a particular business we will move on that too, whether that be a vessel or an operation itself.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, now we expect if the oil prices pick up, a lot of these competitors will not basically be able to compete, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>It is not quite as, yes they won’t be able to compete as much, yeah they will definitely become less significant in market in the market, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. My last question is regarding Chinese devaluing of its currency, do you see, do you foresee any impact from that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that could translate to increased Chinese exports, that might have a – be a positive driver for the container business, which is certainly a big customer base to us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So you see that in a way as a positive?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>I do, I do. I think it is a positive macro kind of comment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That’s all from me. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Georgiopoulos </span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Tavlarios</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>At this time there are no more questions. This concludes the Aegean Marine Petroleum Network Inc. conference call. Thank you and have a nice day.</p>
