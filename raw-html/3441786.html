If you have not received it, you can find it in our Web site, www.latamairlinesgroup.net in the Investor Relations section.</p>
<p>At this time, I would like to point out that statements regarding the Company's business outlook and anticipated financial and operating results constitute forward-looking comments. These expectations are highly dependent on the economy, the airline industry and international markets. Therefore they are subject to change.</p>
<p>Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to Ms. Gisela Escobar, Senior Corporate Controller and IR officer of LATAM Airlines Group. Ms. Escobar, please begin.</p>
<p><strong>Gisela Escobar</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much and good day everyone. Thanks for joining our call. We are here with AndrÃ©s Osorio, who is the CFO of LATAM Airlines Group and we're also joined by Roberto Alvo who is in charge of International Passenger Operations and AndrÃ©s del Valle who is in charge of Corporate Finance and from Brazil we're joined by Claudia Sender, who is the President of TAM.</p>
<p>We'll begin the presentation if you go to -- sorry I also want, we're just being joined by Alberto Solari who is in charge of the Cargo Operations. If you turn to the slides on our webcast presentation looking at the first slide that we have, we wanted to first mention that during the second quarter we obviously have a lot of updates and a lot of news but we have made significant program on various different strategic fronts. As we continue to consolidate our leadership position in Latin America. This includes the launch of our new brand. It includes the completion of a couple of important financing transactions the continued development of our hub and important progress in terms of cost efficiency and cost reduction program.</p>
<p>Nonetheless as you know during the quarter we have seen the macroeconomic situation in Latin American become increasingly more challenging especially in Brazil and this has impacted our results and is visible as you can see in our second quarter numbers by declines especially on our total revenue lines in both the passenger and the cargo operations. When we look at the situation in Brazil, we have numbers that have gotten increasingly worse. We're seeing today estimates of approximately 1.5% declines in GDP inflation that's at over 9% and continued devaluation and continued volatility of the Brazilian currency. So all of that has resulted in the airline industry in Brazil as a whole suffering from declines in demand, as a result we have made certain adjustments to our domestic network which we have already announced.</p>
<p>And we have also reduced our guidance for the year in terms of EBIT margin which we will also discuss in more detail, but we have basically published a reduction in our expected EBIT margin for the full year 2015. I think it's important to note that we have seen outside of Brazil that our operations continued to show improved profitability versus last. We've seen some impacts obviously on the revenue side from currency devaluations but we have also seen benefits from cost efficiencies and fuel price reductions. So as a whole these improvements in profitability have allowed us to offset in part the negative effect of what we're seeing in Brazil.</p>
<p>If you turn to Slide Number 3 of the slide deck, this is a summary of the numbers that we published for our second quarter results. Basically we have seen a significant decline on the revenue side. Revenues are down 20.8% in the quarter compared to last year 21.8% on the passenger side, 21.3% on the cargo side. This is offset by a very significant reduction on the cost side of also 21% that cost reduction is being driven by lower fuel cost as well as by our cost efficiency initiatives and by the positive effects that we have from the devaluation of local currencies on our cost that are denominated in local currency. As a result of all that our operating income is up 12%, in the quarter our operating margin is showing a slight improvement versus the second quarter of last year, and our net income is 15, our net loss let's say is lower than what it was in the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>If we turn to the next slide which is Slide Number 5, we can look a little bit in more detail at the passenger revenue line. What we can see here is that overall our capacity was up during the quarter 2% and that was driven mainly by growth in the Spanish speaking country domestic operations those were the five domestic operations that we have outside of Brazil and also by a 3% growth on the international group when we look at international operations our capacity is up a 3% traffic is up 2.1% those factors are very strong at 84.5% and we have seen a decline of 15.9% in terms of revenue per ASK most of which is being driven by a decline on the roots stewing from Brazil both on the Long Haul and regional operations.</p>
<p>When we look at domestic result a operations which is approximately one third of our total capacity, we have cut capacity during the second quarter in domestic Brazil by 0.5% are lowered factors are 79.5% and our revenue per ASK decline is 34%. That 34% is in U.S. dollar terms if we look at our revenue per ASK decline in Brazilian reals the decline is 12% that's driven mainly by a decline in the corporate travel demand and in addition to that we have the 36% devaluation of the Brazilian real on average during the quarter which obviously impacts the number when we look at it in U.S. dollar term.</p>
<p>When we look at the five countries that make up our Spanish speaking domestic operations there we are growing at a rate of 4% in the second quarter that growth is being driven mainly by a growth in Peru and in Colombia and in overall there our revenue per ASK decline is 7% which is basically fully explained by the devaluation of the local currency especially in Chile, Peru, Colombia and Argentina. Chile, Peru and Argentina the devaluation of currencies versus last year in the range of 10% on average in Colombia we had a very strong devaluation of 28% in the quarter. When we look at the revenue per ASKs in local currencies the revenue per ASK is improving in Chile, Peru and Argentina and in Ecuador so in these markets we are seeing improved profitability with respect to what we had in the same quarter of last year.</p>
<p>Turning to the cost side as you know and as we've already announced we are working on a very significant cost efficiency program our target there is a reduction of $800 million in terms of total cost to be achieved during the next three years to reach the run rate by 2018. What we've seen in the second quarter is in line with our targets in terms of this cost saving plan. If we look at our total cost for the second quarter you can see that we had a 14% reduction of costs on the wages and benefits side this was driven by a 1% reduction in our average headcount for the quarter which is about 570 ASKs and lower on average than what we had in second quarter 2014 and this is despite the fact that we grew in ASKs 2% in the second quarter compared to last year.</p>
<p>On the aircraft cost side we have cost remaining relatively flat we have reductions in depreciation cost and reduction in aircraft rentals and slightly higher cost on the maintenance side mainly driven by the redelivery of certain aircrafts during the quarter. And then in terms of all of the other costs we have a total reduction of approximately 21% where we are seeing a portion of this driven by the devaluation of the local currency which reduced the cost denominated in local currency by reduced sales cost and reduced rental and landing fees as well.</p>
<p>So overall if we look at our total operating cost exclude we see a very significant reduction in almost 14% during the quarter in terms of total cost per ASK equivalent. In addition to that we have the benefit of lower fuel cost, fuel costs were down by approximately 34% which was a total savings of $637 million in the second quarter compared to our fuel build in the second quarter of 2014 sorry of 352 million compared to the fuel cost that we had last year. So with that our total operating cost per ASK equivalent was down almost 21% in the quarter.</p>
<p>We wanted to mention briefly an update in terms of our strategic initiatives that we have already mentioned part of it has to do with the cost reduction which I think we've already discussed but also wanted to talk a little bit about the progress that we've made in terms of our customer experience and the focus that we have on improving and continuously improving the customer experience of LATAM Airlines Group and also in terms of the development of our network.</p>
<p>Turning to Page 8 you can see that we continue to strengthen our network and we continue to focus on providing our passengers with the best connectivity within South America as well as travelling to the region and from the region abroad. To that end we have launched a series of new groups during the second quarter and we have also announced new groups during the second quarter to be flown over the coming months. These routes which are here on the slide are basically focused on strengthening the hubs that we have at Lima the Brasilia hub where we've added flights from Brasilia to Orlando and Brasilia to Buenos Aires in recent months and also our main hub at Guarulhos airport in Sao Paulo. And with this our objective continues to be to strengthen the network and to build the strongest network in South America.</p>
<p>A very important milestone that we had a couple of weeks ago and that has made us very happy to finally announce the new brand which is we announced on August 6th. And this is the -- we are unifying the land and TAM brands under a single brand is which is LATAM. This will be a gradual process that will take place over the next three years. But you'll see next year during 2016 especially already the phasing out of the LAN and the TAM brands and you'll see LATAM appearing at airports, at airport counters and sales offices and basically in different points of contact where the company operates as we gradually phase out the LAN and TAM brands and establish LATAM as a single brand for the group. This new brand will include the most solid strength and the main attributes that LAN and TAM has over their respective history.</p>
<p>And turning to Page 10 we also wanted to mention the progress that we've made in terms of launching new aspects of our passenger experience and the continues improvement that we are making in terms of passenger experience. We unified the counters to have single check in already at 10 of the remaining airports where we operate. So you no longer have separate check in for LAN and TAM but a single counter where you can check in for both LAN and TAM. We also are testing a service Self-service Self-Bag Tag for a faster bag drop process at two main airports in Brazil. In terms of digital solutions for contingency management we've launched flight chat and a flight status app and we have also continued with installing the wireless in flight entertainment system for personal devices and we already have this installed at 68 of our A-320s and we expect all of our A-320 fleet to have this in operation by the first quarter of 2016.</p>
<p>Also a very significant is the improvement in terms of on time performance that we continue to see throughout our network. Especially if you look at our domestic Brazil operations we are at record levels in terms of punctuality with a 16 minute standard including all of the domestic operation in Brazil the punctuality levels are almost at 91% with a 15 minute standards there at approximately 90% in the Spanish speaking countries and close to 85% within all of our international network.</p>
<p>Regarding our hedging strategy both for fuel and for FX we currently have hedged approximately 42% of our estimated fuel consumption for the next 12 months. So this for the period between July 2015 and June 2016 with the breakdown that you can see there on the quarter we are 50% hedged for the second semester of this year in terms of our estimated fuel consumption and then on a declining basis for the first quarter of 2016 and reaching a 10% hedged for the last quarter of 2016. And regarding our exposure to FX we have as you know more revenues than cost denominated in Brazilian currency. Therefore we have a long position so to speak in terms of Brazilian reals when we look at the exposure of our operating result to the devaluations of that currency. We hedge the totality of that exposure we have $310 million hedged for the second half of this year at an average of 320 reals per dollar.</p>
<p>During the second quarter we completed two important financing transactions. We issued our first unsecured bond for $500 million and we also completed the issuance of $1 billion double ETC issuance to finance aircraft deliveries until March of 2016. And with that we have financed approximately 57% of our fleet commitment for 2016 and we've also improved our leverage ratio and cash position as you can see here on the slide. We are currently at a net leverage of 5.1 times and our cash is approximately 14% of last 12 months revenues.</p>
<p>Looking at our fleet plan which is on Slide Number 13 you can see the fleet plan that we have for this year we expect to end this year with 329 jets and for next year 2016 to end of the year with 336 aircraft. Basically this fleet plan is relatively unchanged. I think there is a slight reduction in terms of our total fleet commitments versus what you saw last quarter for 2016 mainly as a result of the delayed delivery of four aircrafts into 2017, but other than that the fleet commitment remained more the less the same.</p>
<p>We have a significant turnover of aircraft what we're doing is phasing out older aircraft in our fleet and incorporating newer and more modern and more efficient aircraft. So here you can see that we're growing from 21 A321s to 48 A321s in 2016 and we're growing from 10 787s that we had at the end of 2014 to a total of 22 787s and also 7 A360s at the end of 2016. So a significantly higher proportion of our fleet will be newer and more efficient aircraft which is also resulting in a lower and more efficient fuel consumption for the Company and also in an improved passenger experience as these aircrafts come with a renewed cabin interior and also with the unified interior cabin that we have defined for LATAM Airlines Group.</p>
<p>Finally the last slide shows you our current guidance, the main change here in terms of passenger capacity growth has to do with a reduction in our Brazil domestic capacity guidance, we were previously expecting to be flat for 2016 in terms of total capacity and our current estimate is to have a reduction of between 2% and 4% of our ASKs in the domestic Brazil group which will occur mostly in the third quarter and in the fourth quarter reaching up to an 8% to 10% reduction in the fourth quarter versus the last year level.</p>
<p>Our capacity guidance for the international and the Spanish speaking countries remains the same and our capacity guidance for cargo also remains the same with an estimated reduction of up to 2% driven mainly by the reductions that we're doing in our freighter capacity offset impart by the growth that we're seeing in the bellies in the passenger planes as a result of the growth in international operations. Also here and mainly as I mentioned earlier as a result of the outlook that we have for Brazil we have reduced our operating margin guidance from our previous 6% to 8% to 3.5% to 5% for the full year 2015.</p>
<p>That completes the prepared remarks that we had and we'll be happy to take any questions that you may have.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Bernando VÃ©lez form GBM. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bernando VÃ©lez</span></strong></p>
<p>I was wondering and trying to match I don't know if you saw the capacity guidance by goal and to see how that relates to your capacity goals meaning if compare to what's in Brazil continue drop in capacity in the upcoming months and probably onto 2016, what should we expect from domestic capacity by TAM?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we cannot talk about competitorsâ strategy, so, this is Claudia by the way hi. I am going to talk about our strategy. We have reduced capacity because we saw significant potential in some of the routes and this is what was done and we're keeping, we're maintaining our plan that we have announced three weeks ago. Of course we're always flexible looking ahead what's going to happen with the demand and with the overall market, but we believe in what we have announced three weeks ago is the right measure for how big the market or how big the demand is forecasted to be in the second quarter. Therefore we believe that there will be -- sorry second half of 2015, but we believe that this will help us somehow fewer recovery in yields and because the demand will be much more -- the capacity will be much more matched to the demand.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bernando VÃ©lez</span></strong></p>
<p>And regarding the flexibility of your fleet commitments for 2016, could you comment on what changed from last quarter to this one and what could continue changing if you decide to further reduce capacity in Brazil?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry the question is regarding fleet or capacity in particular?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bernando VÃ©lez</span></strong></p>
<p>The fleet commitments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So with respect to last this is Roberto Alvo how are you? With respect to fleet coming from last quarter to this quarter, we are basically for 2016 delaying three single aisle aircraft and one wide body aircraft we do not expect that any other movements that are significant in 2015 going forward to 2017 and 2018 onwards I think that should was said in the press release were currently looking at delaying the delivery of a certain number of wide bodies aircraft that has yet to be defined and if we end up during this we will communicate that to the market in time.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question is from Duane Pfennigwerth from Evercore. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Eisenberg</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Jeff Eisenberg in for Duane. So, on your margin guidance I assume that some of that margin that you protect at 3.5% to 5% is tie to the domestic capacity that is -- can you comment on where operating margin would be if not for this contemplated cuts?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>Well it's not significantly impacted by the capacity cuts as Claudia mentioned the logic of doing the reduction in capacity is to better adjust the existing capacity to the current levels of demand. So I think the main reason for the decline in guidance has to do with the weaker demand environment in Brazil as a result of the current macro scenario and part of the response to that was our adjustment of capacity in the domestic market versus what we had previously planned.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Eisenberg</span></strong></p>
<p>And then I think you also mentioned that you had grown Colombia capacity in the quarter and I think when your competitors had described competitive demand weakness and some are saying foreign exchange pressures so I guess could you comment on the year expansion that was at variance or if Colombia trends are holding up for you guys?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>Well. The dynamic in the Colombian domestic market this year the market in general has already last year posted a significant double-digit growth in terms of capacity and for this year also the industry as a whole is growing at level of the between 15% and 17% in ASK so we are in line with that and that is obviously led to some pressure on yield and what we are seeing now as of the last few months in addition to that I mean this growth was basically a response to an opportunity that the industry received to grow capacity in this market and what we had seen in Colombia was a very healthy demand level because of the economic situation in the country now we are seeing a negative impact in terms of our revenue per ASK and local currencies also as a result of the devaluation of the currency the Colombian currency as I'm sure is devaluate almost 30% in the second quarter so we are looking at what impacts that is going to have for our capacity growth plans for the second half we may already in terms of on a competitive basis we had a lot of growth in the second half of last year so the second half of this year will grow less than the growth that we had in the first half. [Multiple Speakers] I think that Claudia mentioned that Colombia for us still is very small, a domestic operation, still a relatively small part of our total network.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeff Eisenberg</span></strong></p>
<p>If I could sneak one more in at current levels are you having any discussions or having any appetite to buy back stock?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>Well. In Chile the stock buyback score are not really you can't implement them the way that you can in the U.S. there are certain restrictions in terms of being able to do stock buyback and also you can't do a stock reduction so if the company does stock buybacks you have to do it for a specific purpose and if and you can't reduce those shares you have the obligation to sell them back in into the market within a very limited timeframe. So unfortunately it's not a tool that we can use in the way that companies can use in other markets.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And our next question is from the Victor Mizusaki from Bradesco. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Victor Mizusaki</span></strong></p>
<p>I have a couple of questions on Europe, first I mean can you give a more granularity on what happened with yields in the second quarter I mean if you can give or breakdown on what happened in the April, May and June and given that your release of your cap figures for July can you comment on what happened in July with the yields and what you can see in your forward book?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>Victor do you mean Brazil overall do you have any specifics?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Victor Mizusaki</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Brazil.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>So what we have seen I'm not going to break it down by month but what I'm going to tell you a little of the trend that we've been seeing July is a month where we finally start seeing a slow pick up I think it's too early to say that is structural recovery in the level of yields but we have seen some pick up in the last weeks of July and the first week of August. So we believe that it could potentially be a trend.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Victor Mizusaki</span></strong></p>
<p>And if you think about international for example is there any specific mark in the second quarter that was with week and forced the company to reduce guidance for the full year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>No there is no significant difference between the months in the quarter. And the dynamics of yields are pretty much the same that you see in domestic with this the situation in Brazil is an industrial situation more than an issue of domestic versus international.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Victor Mizusaki</span></strong></p>
<p>And just last question I mean because we introduce CapEx reduction basically the company is expected that year to year have a positive direction right I mean if the bond in second half. But is there any plan for LATAM if you did not respond?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>Victor I think we are following the market very closely. As I said before we do believe that the adjustment that was announced will be enough to adjust capacity to current levels of demand. Of course there is so much uncertainty in the market that we have to be flexible and agile to respond any changes that happen. So if the market happens to pick up and we have a higher level of confidence in the market we can respond quickly and we're able because we're such a big group. We have some more flexibility to respond to that level of demand quickly or on the other hand if the market continues to deteriorate further than was announced we also have the flexibility to change what -- to adjust more of the capacity to the demand. However we donât think that this will be necessary in the short term.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Mike Linenberg from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Linenberg</span></strong></p>
<p>Just a couple questions here I guess the cloudy the capacity cut this year domestic Brazil is down 2% to 4%. I guess by the fourth quarter it is down 8% to 10%. I wanted to confirm is that -- when the press release came out a few weeks ago and it talked about new cutting your domestic footprint in Brazil by 8% to 10%. Where we will be there by the fourth quarter for some reason I thought it was going to be more gradual and if it occur over several year. But it sounds like it's we're going to be there by the fourth quarter is that right I'm interpreting in that correctly?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes we will get 8% to 10% by the fourth quarter of this year. We have already -- if you look at the schedule that was published for the next few months it is gradual it's been decreasing capacity month over month and this is the level that we will achieve by the end of the year. Having said that I think it's important to remind a few things that we have mentioned when we announced the capacity cut. First we're not leaving any of the basis that we all the efforts that we couldnât be served. So we're still covering the same percentage of the domestic flows and second we're leveraging our most important hub which is Brasilia. Therefore we can still guarantee a very, very efficient coverage of the domestic flows. So although we are reducing our overall capacity we're still leveraging one of our key assets which is the connectivity through the Brasilia hub.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Linenberg</span></strong></p>
<p>And then just when I think about 8% to 10% by the fourth quarter and it was gradual. For 2016 your domestic capacity in Brazil just rough numbers because it's sort of occurred through this year at later part of this year. Are you going to be down what 5% to 6% is that kind of the range you think about how much smaller your next year in Brazil?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gisela Escobar</span></strong></p>
<p>We're still working on this forecast we're not ready to review the forecast by next year yet I'm sorry.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Linenberg</span></strong></p>
<p>And then just a last question and maybe Gisela this is for you. I look at the market values of Multiplus and Smiles and you look at the market cap of the airline and you can see just such a huge disconnect out there. Is there at a point where you start re-thinking [indiscernible] and where [indiscernible] all this and especially if you're now moving to a single brand the LATAM brand where do things stand now as it relates to the TAM for [indiscernible] and the [indiscernible] program as you move to single brand. Do we see any sort of combination there just your thoughts on it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>This Roberto Alvo of course we're always looking of different alternatives for doing several things at the company. At this moment we have not changed our decision into how we will continue with those multiples but we are increasingly emerging the features of our both [indiscernible] program. So during the course of the second semester and next year some of the features will be harmonized. But we still have two collections for the time being and to [indiscernible] program needs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Linenberg</span></strong></p>
<p>And then if I could just squeeze in one last one where are we on the front as we move towards Open Skies U.S and Brazil and that kicks in I think in the next couple of months I think itâs October or I could be wrong, have you put out any sort of -- have you seen any sort of press releases or is there anything going on with you and America and about potentially speaking anti-trust community?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>Mike as we mentioned we're still waiting for the rectification from the Brazilin government about the Open Skies agreements which should happen by October, well that's the deadline. So we're waiting for that until we can announce anything.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question is from Renato Salomone from ItaÃº BBA. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Renato Salomone</span></strong></p>
<p>The international market we haven't seen by the industry especially between Brazil and the U.S. any adjustments in capacity and when I look you've added if I am not mistaking the first half of the year about 2.5% ASK in the international market in your guidance 4% to 6%, is there any chance that you revised that as well does that concern you that the market is not adjusting in the U.S. in relative to Brazil and U.S.?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Roberto Alvo so a couple of things, first, I think it's important to see what airlines were announcing six months ago or a year ago in terms of growth in Brazil and what they're publishing today. So yes there hasn't been a decreasing supply, but I think there has been a significant decrease in the growth that was projected into Brazil for 2015, so the adjustment is probably not with respect to the base but definitely with respect to future plans of many carriers. The 4% to 6% remember is the whole international passenger business which has approximately 50% of its capacity in Brazil and 60% of its capacity outside Brazil, so here you're looking at the blended number between what we expect to grow in both Brazil and outside Brazil. So we're confident and we donât that we need to make an important change to the guidance we have made 4% to 6% at this point in time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Renato Salomone</span></strong></p>
<p>And in the international where do have aircraft -- wide body aircraft deliveries scheduled for the remainder of the year and for the first half of that you won't be able to change that there is nothing you can change?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>So I will not comment on our ability to change. I will tell you the deliveries we have, we still have pending 3 787-9 deliveries and the first 8 350 deliveries by the end of the year. And the next year we have 6 A350 deliveries and 5 I think 787 deliveries. We are facing out all of our 330 fleet today we have 10 330 airplanes. So in terms of number of total airplanes we are basically flat.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Renato Salomone</span></strong></p>
<p>And a quick follow-up, can you, you've mentioned the percentage of fuel consumption hedge, can you give us the average prices you have for the second half of the year and for 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">AndrÃ©s del Valle</span></strong></p>
<p>AndrÃ©s del Valle here we typically do not provide the process of fleet which we're hedged because of course of our market reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question is from Stephen Trent from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stephen Trent</span></strong></p>
<p>Most have been answered but just a few follow-ups if I may and forgive me if I missed if you've already said this, but on Brazil understanding that capacity drawdown that you guys mentioned, have you any further color as to where you're going to redeploy that if you're allowed to tell me if some are going to be subleased or you're going to put them into the markets and what's the idea there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Roberto Alvo again so just a couple of comments on that we have significant wide -- single aisle flexibility in terms of fleet so approximately 5% to 7% of the fleet expires every year or is phased out because of aging, so we retain a high degree of flexibility of either returning planes or maintaining those planes as we go ahead. And we also have an important level of flexibility between moving aircraft from the TAM size to the LATAM size by switching operations that we do currently today with both carriers. So we don't see any -- we don't have any particular concern with respect to our single aisle flexibility, single aisle fleet flexibility given or issues given the flexibility we have.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stephen Trent</span></strong></p>
<p>And with respect to the fleet I recall that you guys were in this phase for awhile to pick the TAM aircraft and move them on to the balance sheet in San Diego and could you just refresh my memory where that stands?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes we have made a significant improvement on that front. I think the balance sheet that the TAM mismatched the balance sheet driven asset liabilities is down too below $1 million, so I think we've moved already the majority aircraft those these finance leases, commercial financing and UCA financing, and still up here can we move up that but that we're in the process and the process is expected to be completed within this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stephen Trent</span></strong></p>
<p>And just one last question and might be a question for Claudia sorry to bombard you here Claudia just curious that Brazilian airlines have been fairly active that past several quarters this Avior association I am probably miss pronouncing it and now we're seeing potential changes payroll taxation and fee [indiscernible] and what have you in any of sort of broad color how active Avior is in having discussions with the government or is the current situation just too volatile that the dialogues declined versus where it was last year or the year before?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>You have pronounced it correctly it's Avior the association has been fairly active I think as all of the industry entities have been trying to somehow mitigate the impact of the new taxation and I think we've been quite effective on that it's still too early to tell though all of the measures that you have mentioned are still going through Congress so kind of hard to understand what will be the final picture but what we've trying to do as an industry is to calculate and expose and explain in a fairly simple way what is the impact that does have on us in a moment where there are so many macro economic variables that are also they are also in place. I think one of the examples of how Avior has been very effective is in the definition of the what we call the labor and also the group of activity with revision lot where we have come to an agreement with the union through Congress to a much more palatable regulation going forward which is also so transiting through Congress and still yet to be define but as much more reasonable terms than the original preposition that we had on the table.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question is from Daniel Guardiola from LarrainVial. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Guardiola</span></strong></p>
<p>I have a very quick question. I would like to touch on the fleet commitments. I saw in your second Q 2015 report that 2016 commitments were cut by $340 million. And I would like to know if you could please comment with us from which sources are you expecting to fund the $2 billion commitments for 2016 in an environment of depressed yields? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. For 2016 as the press release commented that we have already finance 57% of that total and those are the commitments roughly 50% of that should be done through public releases and phases and debts from finance leases so what's yet to be financed for 2016 is approximately $1 million and we have already issued the RPs up with the operating thesis and the next that two or three weeks will lost our RP for finance leases and the first asset to be financed which has not financed yet delivers in April next year so we have a number one ample time to do that with those financings and number two we have our older markets soften both our capital markets side ECS put loans and commercial loans as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Guardiola</span></strong></p>
<p>And just a follow-up regarding that if necessary, how much could you further cut this commitments for 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>How much of I'm sorry?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Guardiola</span></strong></p>
<p>How much could you further cut this commitments for 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Roberto Alvo</span></strong></p>
<p>I think we already commented that Dan on the our flexibility for 2016 what has been said already at that we postponed three narrow body aircraft and one wide body aircraft this is what we have done so far and we can up that on 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And we have a question from the line of Marcio Prado from Goldman Sachs. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marcio Prado</span></strong></p>
<p>I would just like to make a quick follow-up question on the jet fuel hedge. I heard you comment that you are not going to comment on the average price. However, we have seen a large increase in terms of the hedging levels. If I'm not mistaken in first Q the Company was at around 30% to 35%. Now the Company is at above 40%. So can you comment on the timing with regards to the implementation of this increase in the hedging levels, if this was spread throughout the second quarter, or if in fact not only second quarter but also third quarter? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">AndrÃ©s del Valle</span></strong></p>
<p>I think for the third quarter of this year we could have a sort of our legacy hedge that was taken at the year before and now for this year our side [indiscernible] commented we have a total for the next from today through Q4 of next year 2016 the total is roughly 2% to 3% consumption hedged for this year is roughly 50% and for next 12 months it's roughly 40% and this is in line with the crew policy for which we typically have for the nearby quarter which is in front of us 50% of hedged and then or may declining skill going forward so I donât think we have seen substantial changes in level of our hedging policy that's is roughly the same that as we have done in the past.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marcio Prado</span></strong></p>
<p>Just on the front and what are the hedging levels in first Q that you have disclosed for the next several months. Wasnât it close to the 30% level just thatâs why I mentioned the higher hedging level so?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>I think your point is that we have taken a lot of these hedges especially the 2016 hedges during the past three months thatâs correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marcio Prado</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>And thatâs in line with Andreas was mentioning it's in line with our commencing of always looking to hedge for the next four or five quarters. We have seen now during the past three months the opportunities to stuck building our position for until the fourth quarter of 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And we have a question from the line of Ricardo Fernandez from EuroAmerica. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ricardo Fernandez</span></strong></p>
<p>[Indiscernible]</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>Ricardo your line is breaking up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ricardo Fernandez</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes well I canât help that whatever it is. Can you hear me now, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>We can hear you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ricardo Fernandez</span></strong></p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>Go ahead. We can hearâ¦</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ricardo Fernandez</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes? Okay. The question if we assume the low end of the guidance range 3% EBIT margin. And will that allow you to maintain your CapEx you're funding even into 2016. Very low margin or do you think you will need to do something on either capital rates or asset sales?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>No we donât foresee the need to do that at this point. As Andreas mentioned we have already financed more than half of our fleet commitments for 2016. And the remaining are already in process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ricardo Fernandez</span></strong></p>
<p>So even at the low end of cash generation 3% or so you are confident that you can go through the end of 2016 with CapEx that you have?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Claudia Sender</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And I'm not showing any further questions. I will turn the call back to Ms. Gisela Escobar for any final remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Gisela Escobar</strong></p>
<p>Well, thanks everyone for your participation in today's call. If you have any follow-up questions we're available here at LATAM and through the IR department to take any questions you may have. Thanks a lot and have a good day.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
