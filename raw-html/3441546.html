<p><strong>Douglas Raucy</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Terry. And welcome everyone to our quarterly conference call. Joining me on the call today is our Chief Financial Officer, John Hill.</p>
<p>Our second quarter was highlighted by growth in our core Louisiana market and our first Texas premium through the Brotherhood Mutual alliance. This growth was largely driven by our understanding of these markets and our first rate independent age of network. Our financial results were impacted by weather-related events, namely wind and hail that affected many of the markets in which we write.</p>
<p>On today's call I'll discuss our growth and the impact of these seasonal events on our bottomline. John will discuss our financials in greater detail. And then I'll return to summarize our strategy in the coming months. After which, we'll be happy to take any questions you may have.</p>
<p>For the quarter, the company's gross premiums written were up 37.2% from the same quarter last year to $12.2 million from $8.9 million. There are two primary drivers to this growth. The first is our ability and experience at 1347 PIH. And the second is the overall favorable market conditions. In addition, we had our new alliance with Brotherhood Mutual.</p>
<p>Since the company's inception in October of 2012, we have expanded our geographic presence to 63 of the 64 parishes within the State of Louisiana. This business is supported by a strong network of independent agency partners through relationships we have developed in our many years of experience in the State.</p>
<p>Thus far in 2015 we have improved in-force policy count significantly, which has been produced by our agency network, with cultivated relationships with our business partners over many years and have similar experience in other coastal states.</p>
<p>As we expand, we plan on leveraging similar operational strength in every market we enter to successfully write our specialized type of business. We continue to benefit from the gradual reduction in coastal exposure by large national and regional insurance companies that use property insurance as a component of what they write.</p>
<p>We currently write four products, homeowners, wind and hail only, manufactured home and dwelling fire policies. The majority of our policies are homeowners, supported by wind and hail and manufactured home, all of which are written through our wholly-owned subsidiary, Maison Insurance Company.</p>
<p>We are able to differentiate our sales from large national writers, because our business model allows us to manage risk locally versus managing on a national exposure basis. Our overall book of business includes a diverse selection of policies. As we continue to grow, we are looking to maintain a well-rounded book, although the mixture may change as we expand.</p>
<p>Many customers and agents will prefer our policy, because we provide overall better service and a higher commission for the agents. Taking these two things into consideration and having an experience-based understanding of the underlying cost of risk, we then price our products accordingly to delivery expected above-average underwriting margins.</p>
<p>The value of our service component was particularly evident in the past few months, where we experienced higher than normal amounts of claims related to storm activity. While this activity negatively impacted our income in the quarter, it also galvanized our relationships with many clients.</p>
<p>These claims affected our combined ratio and ultimately our bottomline for the period. We recorded higher than normal loss ratio during the period, as a result of unusually high wind and hail activity. John will go into our ratios in greater detail in a moment.</p>
<p>While we encountered losses in the period, we understand that properly underwriting natural risk is the nature of our business. Though this does affect earnings in short-term period, because this activity was seasonal in nature, the combined ratio in the quarter is not reflective of our expectation for the full year.</p>
<p>We also have in place a sufficient financial infrastructure and reinsurance protection to safely grow in a sustainable manner. This mitigates risk to both the company and the investor, so events such as those in the second quarter are not significant threats to the positive long-term prospects of the company.</p>
<p>We see these as being opportunities to both strengthen our agency relationships and demonstrate how we are different than our competitors by further displaying our client handling expertise.</p>
<p>Now, I'd like to turn it over to John Hill, our CFO, to go through the financial results in greater detail. And then I'll return for closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>John Hill</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Doug. Now, I'll briefly go through our financial highlights of our quarter ended June 30, 2015. I encourage everyone to review our press release and Form 10-Q, which was filed yesterday evening for additional information. We've included year-to-date information in both documents, but for purposes of this call, I'll focus primarily on the quarter.</p>
<p>To begin, gross premiums written increased 37.2% to $12.2 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared with $8.9 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014. This was due to organic growth through our independent agency network, which Doug previously mentioned, that resulted in an increase in the company's in-force policy count.</p>
<p>Our policies in-force grew an annualized 23.6% during the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, from approximately 22,300 to approximately 23,600 policies at June 30. Our policies in-force are up 40.6% from June 30, 2014. Net premiums earned increased 31.9% to $6.3 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared with $4.7 million for the quarter ended June 30, 2014.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, we entered into a new catastrophe reinsurance program with a similar structure to previous contract years. We increased our coverage from $92 million to $140 million. This is proportionate to the increase in exposure related to our greater number of in-force policies.</p>
<p>Additionally, the consecutive hour coverage arising for a particular event was increased from 120 hours to 144 hours, while the total cost increased from approximately $10.2 million to $13.8 million. The rate online for these coverages decreased approximately 15%, while maintaining the same aggregate retention of prior year at $5 million. This reduction in effective cost is both indicative of our claim handling experience as well as the continuing soft reinsurance market.</p>
<p>Our net loss ratio was 48.3% and 24.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and 2014, respectively. We incurred significant increase in weather-related losses for the 2015 period due to numerous wind and hailstorms. The weather-related claims were approximately 80% of the net incurred losses for the quarter ended June 30, 2015, whereas weather-related storms made up 60% of the net incurred losses during the second quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>One single event made up of series of storms, which occurred during the last week of April 2015, accounted for $1.45 million of the weather-related losses of both the three and the six month period ended June 30, 2015, for properties that we insure in the state Louisiana.</p>
<p>This event, while not classified as a catastrophe, represented approximately 50% of the total incurred net losses for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. As a comparison, our total 2014 year weather-related claims processed were approximately 25%. We have defined catastrophe loss as an event, where our estimated loss exceeds $1.5 million.</p>
<p>Non-weather-related losses experienced during the second quarter ended June 30, 2015, improved slightly over the same quarter of 2014. Non-weather claims were approximately 20% of the total net incurred losses for the second quarter ended 2015 compared with approximately 40% of the total incurred net loss for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014.</p>
<p>Deferred policy acquisition cost amortization was in line with our growth in premium. This includes items such as commissions earned by our agents, premium taxes, assessments and a portion of our policy processing fees. Deferred policy acquisition cost amortization, expressed as a percentage of gross premiums earned, was 17.3% for the quarter compared to 17.9% in the prior-year period.</p>
<p>This reduction is primarily due to a larger portion of renewal business generated in 2015 from the company's independent agents. Our commission structure is such that agents receive a lower commission payout on renewal business when compared to new business.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses, expressed as a percentage of gross premiums earned, was 21.8% for the three months ended June 30, 2015, compared to 24.5% for the three months ended June 30, 2014. Our ratio improved, as growth in gross earned premium outpaced the increase in general and administrative cost during the period.</p>
<p>While some G&amp;A expenses were higher in the second quarter due to first-time events, such as filing our first proxy and holding our first Annual Meeting, we expect our G&amp;A expenses, expressed as a percentage of gross premiums earned, to continue to decline as our premiums increase profitability. We are proud of the fact, that despite these new costs our overall gross loss ratio declined year-over-year, demonstrating improved operating efficiency.</p>
<p>For the second quarter of 2015, the company reported a net combined ratio of 105.2% compared to 79.6% for the prior-year period. The impact of the April storm was 23.2% in all weather-related losses accounted for 39.8% of the net combined ratio for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>Whereas weather-related losses accounted for 15.2% of the net combined ratio for the second quarter ended June 30, 2014. Therefore, excluding the impact of weather-related claims for the second quarter of 2015 and 2014, the net combined ratios would have been 65.4% and 64.4%, respectively.</p>
<p>As a result of the aforementioned, in the second quarter of 2015 the company reported a net loss of $0.1 million compared to net income of $0.6 million in the prior-year period. The company reported net loss of $0.02 per diluted share during the second quarter of 2015, based upon 6.4 million weighted average shares outstanding compared to net income of $0.15 per diluted share, during the prior-year period, based on 4.1 million shares outstanding.</p>
<p>Also worth noting in the quarter, we began buying back shares. We realized that we are stewards of capital and that investors rely upon us and trust us to put their capital to use in a way that we will responsibly build value for them and the company. This is what we intend to do, but not all capital can be invested immediately.</p>
<p>We have been pursuing a number of strategic business expansion activities. Some of these opportunities, where we are planning and building upon, have not yet required capital allocation, but will. These carefully selected opportunities will then generate the long-term value that we strive to create at 1347 Property Insurance Holdings.</p>
<p>While the company currently appears to have more capital that it requires, we believe it is important to have dry powder, to ensure that we are able to take advantage of these opportunities. However, based on recent stock price, we feel it was prudent to buyback shares with the amounts we have.</p>
<p>During the second quarter 2015, the company began purchasing its common stock on the open market, through a previously announced buyback program. Through August 12, 2015, the company purchased approximately 92,800 shares at an average price of $8.01 per share. At June 30, 2015, the company's cash and investments aggregated $69.5 million.</p>
<p>With that, I'll turn things back over to Doug to share some closing comments.</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Raucy</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, John. As mentioned, we had a very successful reinsurance placement during the second quarter for the 2015-2016 treaty year. Our overall price went up, as we purchase more cover. However, the comparative rate online was down from prior year, while maintaining our aggregate retention at prior year levels.</p>
<p>We did see the first signs of a possible hardening reinsurance market. We monitor the reinsurance market closely, and we'll provide more information to the expectations for future reinsurance costs appear to be changing. While hardening of the reinsurance market could increase our cost, you should also catalyze an increase in primary insurance rate.</p>
<p>Our second quarter weather losses, when totaled, are almost equal to our reinsurance retention for a major storm, and we still basically broke even for the quarter. While these losses represent the seasonal nature of our business. The losses incurred in the current quarter were abnormally high, caused from a series of continual storms over an eight-week period.</p>
<p>Obviously, our goal is to generate profit, however, this quarter does demonstrate the stability of our business, even in worse than average loss periods. We continue to work on our fundamental strategy. We leverage our experience, relationships and expertise to outperform the market in coastal areas, where there is opportunity due to the large carriers retracting from the market.</p>
<p>These are the core competencies that provided Maison with a competitive advantage, when we started in Louisiana. And we are now leveraging them, as we expand into other states. Maison has the ability to properly underwrite, respond to and pay claims, by fully utilizing the expertise of our people. We expect to continue to grow responsibly by properly managing our capital.</p>
<p>Our goal is to grow aggressively, but intelligently and strategically. Our opportunity in Texas, while still in the early stages, is an example of this expansion. We fairly reviewed and then pursued our alliance with Brotherhood Mutual. The size of the market and Brotherhood's success was a perfect marriage to our niche focus on wind/hail underwriting and claims expertise.</p>
<p>The Texas market overall possesses similar coastal and catastrophe characteristics as Louisiana. We spent over one year researching and developing the plan for Texas expansion. This program is now poised for growth in the second half of 2015. Our Texas strategy includes four distribution channels for profitable growth, which include: partnerships, independent agents, managing general agencies and Texas Windstorm Insurance Association or TWIA, which is the residual market for Texas.</p>
<p>We are continuing to explore and review opportunities in other coastal states that closely match the characteristics of Louisiana. As I mentioned, the company differentiates itself through its expertise and properly underwriting in niche coastal markets. Our senior management has relationships with independent agents and other important business partners in numerous geographies. We will continue to seek methods of deploying our available capital strategically.</p>
<p>As John mentioned, we understand that we serve as stewards of capital for the benefit of our shareholders. With this in mind, we began purchasing our common stock under our share buyback plan. Since we began buying our shares in mid-June 2015, our acquisitions represent approximately 12% of our shares created on the open market through the beginning of this week. We still have ample capacity to purchase additional shares under the term of this plan.</p>
<p>I'd like to close by mentioning that in the past few months, we have thought to expand our Board of Directors to include quality professionals from different backgrounds that can help guide and provide counsel to our company, as we continue to grow.</p>
<p>To that end, I'd like to welcome Scott Wollney, Josh Horowitz and Dennis Wong to our Board of Directors. We have an exceptional Board. We are all aligned in helping 1347 Property Insurance Holdings grow profitably.</p>
<p>Operator, let's open it up for any questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from the line of Joel Salomon with SaLaurMor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>I have a few questions, if you don't mind. First of all, great, great disclosure on the elevated claims this quarter. So just my understanding was that about 80% of the 48% loss ratio was related to, what I'd call, non-cat weather, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Hill</span></strong></p>
<p>80% of the 48% was due to weather related claims and none of the storms in by themselves were above the $1.5 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>So it sound like you said, it was $1.45 million, so you miss the definition of catastrophe by $500,000 or so.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Hill</span></strong></p>
<p>By $50,000, yes, but the largest single series of storm, which covered as a PCS event, that we were tracking was just under a threshold for a catastrophe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>So a little bit nomenclature, but it sounds to me like this quarter was fairly elevated, not a normal second quarter, even though you didn't breach any reinsurance attachment levels. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>I would agree with that assessment, yes, correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>And it seems there have been elevated claims this quarter, I think across a number of your coastal peers, so it wasn't really surprising to us. So thanks for that.</p>
<p>Second question on just the pricing environment, MarketScout showed property rates of 1% in July, 2% for homeowners, one of the few areas where pricing is still going up. I'm just curious what you're seeing in your book? Are you still seeing price increases? And is there any seasonality in terms of the price increases through the spring summer or is it consistent throughout the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Hill</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's a great question, Joel. I think from a pricing standpoint, we're pretty flat. I mean, our reinsurance cost were down again last year and then through the recent buying of reinsurance. So we really can't justify any rate increases at this point in time. And our markets that we're entering are becoming extremely competitive. What we're finding is our competition is going into that market and actually kind of undercutting us in price.</p>
<p>So while, everybody overall maybe up, there are a lot of new companies in our direct competition, is actually in their cutting rates in order to trying to take business away from us. So I don't think we're going to have to do that. I think our pricing is pretty steady at this point in time.</p>
<p>But then one thing I will say about this quarter, it's just really one quarter, I mean, what you find when you write business in states like Texas and Louisiana, spring time is always going to be a very busy time for you. And then, the rest of the other three quarters tend to be not quite as active from a claims standpoint, assuming you do not get a hurricane, right. If we get a hurricane, then it becomes active.</p>
<p>But the spring time is always just going to be very active for us. We hope that, not quite as active as this last quarter was, because we literally did have, Joel, we had eight weeks where we just got pounded every single day with rain, and wind, and hail, which is really is unusual. So I think we're in a point where we can maintain our pricing where it is today, and we'll see how the rest of year falls out and what happens with reinsurance rates as move forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>But it sounds like at least with the renewal you just had, reserve rate on line was down, you said, around 15%, so you should have some nice margin extension, even with pricing flat over the next 12 months?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Hill</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I agree.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>So maybe, we'll switch to the investment side for a second. Even with these really high elevated losses, you still put up 86% combined in the first half, which for most companies, that that would be great, but you're really not generating much on the investment side. And I guess, the question is, you have a large amount in cash in short-term still, and when do you expect to move that into higher yielding investments? Is that over the rest of this year or is it over the next 12 months?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Hill</span></strong></p>
<p>We are slowly building up our bond portfolio, as well as looking at other strategic investments in the marketplace right now with the volatility on the interest rates, so it's a slow moving process, but we are continuing to build that investment portfolio up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me just say one thing too, Joel, some of that powder we really do have to keep dry. John mentioned it in his remarks, I mean as we do look at expansion in the other coastal states, some of that we're going to have to keep liquid in order to allow us to make that expansion.</p>
<p>So we want to grow the Texas book fairly aggressively. We've got some great, what I consider to be, operational plans in place to growth that fairly quickly. And we're just going to need to keep some of that powder dry, so we can continue to do that. And that's the cash that we just can't invest at this point in those high yielding bonds and other items.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>And maybe let's move there next over to Texas. Is there any kind of guidance you could give us in terms of growth out of Texas over the next 12, 24, 36 months? And should we expect similar type of loss ratio, expense ratios to Louisiana? Any type of guidance sort of for modeling purposes will be great?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me just say that, number one, we are very excited about our entrance into Texas and with that opportunity will become, we really feel that there is significant opportunities, that given the size of the market, the products we can offer, the quality of service we can provide and the relationships we already have there.</p>
<p>So we do plan on, as we mentioned already, we plan on further building strong relationships with agents like we've done in Louisiana. We've already established the partnership with a well-established company in the state in terms of Brotherhood. So yes, I think you could safely say that, we anticipate some of the similar types of returns that we're experiencing in Louisiana.</p>
<p>I mean, Texas is a little bit different state though. I mean, they are literally exposed to every catastrophe you could ever imagine, because it's so big and it's so large. Now, we're going to focus mainly on the coastal part of Texas, but we will offset a lot of that growth on the coast from some inland writings too, which will expose us to maybe some different natural payrolls than what we're exposed to in Louisiana.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>So any type of guidance, and should we expect a higher loss ratio, lower expense ratio, any type of growth metrics you can give, so we have similar type of growth in Texas over the next 24 months that you'd experienced in Louisiana over the last 24 months something like that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>It's hard to relate it to, Joel, because the state is so big. I mean, we're virtually looking at a state that's what five times the size of Louisiana. For our metrics, we're looking at possibly little bit higher loss ratios in Texas, just because of that exposure I mentioned in the last little pieces, so I could say, yes, loss ratios we anticipate being a little bit higher.</p>
<p>Growth-wise, we're in the process of modeling TWIA right now. We're not sure what we're going to find in there. We do think there will be some policies we'll be interested in, we're not sure. They don't even have the process set up. And we're not sure, what that process is or how we'll compete with the other nine companies that are in TWIA looking for depopulation.</p>
<p>So lot of unknowns in Texas, but we're going to build this thing, as I mentioned, through our partnerships, through our independent agency channel, through managing general agencies, which is a little bit of a different concept for us, and then, finally, through TWIA. So we anticipate a fairly quick ramp up. Percentage-wise it could be close to what we've done in Louisiana, but numbers-wise different, because just the size of the market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>In terms of the capital management, it look like you bought about 3,000 shares back in 2Q and another 90,000 just in the last what five, six weeks or so. So is that going to, I mean now stock price is actually right around book value, should we expect that to be a good run rate per quarter going forward? And obviously, the stock is trading dramatically below what we think is economic for a value, and so the buybacks will be dramatically accretive at these prices and you still have what more than 400,000 share left?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>Correct, Joel, I would say. And just to kind of correct your number there, we purchased in the second quarter just under 28,000 shares. And then in subsequent date, we disclosed that we'd purchased 92,800 shares through the 12th of August. And I would say that that run rate would continue for a while, as long as we see the prices in this range, correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>And just finally on, operating leverage is very, very low. I know, you have strong growth plans over the next couple of years, and part of the reason why I'm having a hard time getting to 15% ROE. So I guess the question is it seems like you have an ability to ramp pretty dramatically. Some of the peers can write at 1.5 premiums to surplus or even higher.</p>
<p>So it seems like just talking about the buyback, talking about the capital that you need for the businesses, substantial amount of capital, I think even beyond buyback, you could use and pay a dividend. I think you could retain even more business and still be nowhere near that 1.5x. I think I have you getting to 1.2x in my bow case in a really high-growth scenario. So I just put that out there. I don't know if you have any comments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>So when do you have us getting to that 1.2x, Joel, at the end of the 2015, 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It's conservative. I mean, we're in the process of re-forecasting the remainder of this year and 2016, 2017 and into 2018. So we, as possible, will share what we can with that from the forecasting, but we are in a process of re-forecasting that based on the expansion plans that we kind of have on the table.</p>
<p>But we'll see how they -- you know, John and I, we kind of like to under-promise and over-deliver a little bit. But we'll let you guys know. I think you are very conservative on that estimate. [multiple speakers] gross or net basis, probably that's pretty conservative.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joel Salomon</span></strong></p>
<p>On net premiums written to equity basis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Hill</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from the line of Casey Alexander with Gilford Securities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>You guys have done a great job answering most of my questions. I only have one remaining, and that's, as it relates to the competition, as you've seen there has been spilling into the state from out-of-state insurance company, and so you said they've been very aggressive on rate.</p>
<p>In my discussions with them, they have also been aggressive on commission as well. And I know you guys base your business plan off of having the best relationships with the best agents in the state, and they keep telling me that their way into the state is to do help the best relations with the best agents in the state.</p>
<p>So kind of circling around to my real question, which is, if you are offering a lower commission on renewal do you worry about churn, especially when there is companies coming in from out-of-state that are aggressive on premium and are aggressive on commission, are you worried about your agents doing rate shopping and commission shopping?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Hill</span></strong></p>
<p>Casey, great question. From a pure numbers standpoint, I look at retention and alike, and we are not seeing any impact on our retention. And I don't think our overall commission structure is different from what's there in state from a non-competitive standpoint. But I do look at that and our retention ratios are holding tight. So I don't have any concerns from that standpoint.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me jump in Casey, because I want to mention that, yes, a lot of companies will say, we've got the best relationships, but remember -- </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Casey Alexander</span></strong></p>
<p>We can't all have the best relationships with the best agents in the state.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Douglas Raucy</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, that's true. Remember my strategy, when I opened the company in Louisiana, I was going to establish residency in the state. I was going to bring in people who have those relationships in the past, and we were just going to do it differently.</p>
<p>Louisiana is truly a good old boy state. You need to know the market, you need to know the people, you need to know where you need to be competitive and where you don't want to be competitive. And you just don't get that coming in from outside the state, no matter what people tell you they can do.</p>
<p>So that's why we have a guy like Dean Stroud, who has been in there 40 years, worked his way all the way up from the Mayor room to President of Audubon Insurance. He knows every single agent in that state. He's probably the best respected underwriter in the entire state. He knows all the good agents. He knows them on a personal level.</p>
<p>And I put that relationship up against any of the other companies that are telling you, well, we've got the best relationships, because a lot of these people don't even have local employees on the ground in Louisiana. We do. We have an office in Baton Rouge. That's part of our strategy.</p>
<p>I know for a fact, when we talk to the agents, when they have five pieces of business that they're going to write-out during the course of a day, then we're typically getting number one or two in terms of the best business out there. And that some of the other companies may think they are getting the best business, they are not getting one and two, they are probably getting four, five.</p>
<p>And then you just put our loss ratio up against any other companies on a combined overall lost ratio, and you will see that we have some of the lowest loss ratios in the state. A lot of that comes from getting the best business from these agents, and that's really relationship-driven.</p>
<p>As much as people want to say, well, we're going there, we're going to cut Maison's rates, we're going out for more commission and everything else, you just can't duplicate those relationships that we've had and we've build over the last 40 years in the Louisiana. You just can't do it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. At this time, I will turn the floor back to management for closing comments.</p>
<p>End of Q&amp;A</p>
<p><strong>Douglas Raucy</strong></p>
<p>Well, thanks again everybody. Great questions. We did have, what I consider to be, a pretty strong quarter and we look forward to a strong rest of the year. We look forward to speaking with each of you again on our 2015 third quarter conference call. Thanks again everybody for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>This concludes today's teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect your lines at this time.</p>
