<p><strong>Walter Schalka</strong></p>
<p>Good morning everyone. It’s a great pleasure for me to be here with you and thank you very much for participating in this earnings conference call to discuss the results of the second quarter of 2015 of Suzano Papel E Celulose. Here with us today is Mr. Carlos Anibal, our Commercial Officer both for Paper and Pulp; Marcelo Bacci, our CFO and our IR Officer; Alexandre Chueri, our Forestry Business Unit Officer; Carlos Griner, our Human Resources Officer; and Ernesto Pousada, our COO, our Officer for Logistics, Supply and Inventory. I would also like to mention Michelle Corda, the Manager In-charge of Investor Relations.</p>
<p>At the end of the presentation we will be available to take your questions. I would like to begin the presentation on Slide Number 1, the focus does to operating cash generation of the company our EBITDA in the last 12 months was R$2.2 million but we understand that EBITDA is not a good adequate metric for our industry the most adequate metric is operating cash generation and we’re pleased to inform you that we had almost R$2.1 million of operational cash generation in the last 12 months. This KPI is very relevant and as such as of last year we now use this as one of our main KPIs when it comes to variable compensation to our offices. The main objective of the company is that anytime we want to grow gradually are return on capital employed to our shareholders. To that end we understand that moving the high level of the same CapEx in the industry when be operational cash generation becomes the winning factor, the very strong cash generation allowed us to reduce our debt and net debt in the last quarters.</p>
<p>The growth in net debt in the last quarters we have to celebrate our net debt over EBITDA ratio was 3.2 times and this represents a significant reduction in the last 8 months after the end of the [indiscernible] project it was 5.2 times and now the ratio is 3.2 times or 2.9 if you consider it in dollar terms. And a downward projection should continue to occur due to the gradual EBITDA increase that we've been experiencing quarter-on-quarter. I would also like to mention another important measure which is the reduction of the net debt of the company going from 15.3 billion to 13.9 billion. We have adopted a program of cash reduction to allow for a reduction of interest arbitration that we had in [indiscernible] our growth debt is 13.9 and net debt is R$11 billion.</p>
<p>In addition to that with the liability management program of the company we were able to reduce the debt cost in June of this year, the debt was a little bit below of 90% TDI for real denominated debt and the dollar denominated debt was 4% a year. Throughout the quarter now going to Slide Number 4, we developed further liability management actions and there were two very important aspect one was a syndicated lower operation the cost of LIBOR plus 2 with the term of five years and CRA of R$675 million the cost was 101% of CDI with the total term of four years. With that we were able to prepay the debt in a total amount of R$3.3 billion debt which had a higher cost. And because of that we were able to maintain the debt maturity profile while at the same time we were able to reduce interest rates this will allow us to promote a reduction of around R$70 million a year in our financial expenses. And this is a continuous process and we’re calling this process a liability management, we went in before of the liability management program and we’re also introducing other measures, this is a pursue of the company to reach a top capital that is more adequate to the company improvements of the debt maturity profile.</p>
<p>Now on Slide Number 5, I would like to refer to our EBITDA. We had a record high adjusted-EBITDA of R$959 million with 40.2% margin, but as far as our policy on total transparency with the market in an humbleness we believed that we’re below our true potential of R$60 million. And this difference is explained by some factors and most of them are non-recurrent, one of the factors is the fact that we had a start up of the new digester which was started on May 13th according to our plan and this is just to remind you this digester replaces the other five digesters that we had at Suzano so we replaced five old ones by one new digester. The learning curve was a bit longer than expected for the new digester but the good news is that this is already solved it was solved end of June but we didn't capture any benefits in the second quarter certainly the benefit will be more clearly apparent in the third quarter, because now the digester will be running according to plan.</p>
<p>But certainly the fact that we had in the quarter was the effect of energy in April and May there were different energy prices between in our market in North and Southeast and those led us to have a difference in energy capture between what we saw in the North in our Maranhão Unit and what we got in the submarket in the Southeast to our Suzano Unit both have been solved in June but as of July there was a drop in energy prices in all the markets and those will certainly effective us in the third quarter. We also have the adjustment of the long-term incentive plan in Portuguese ILP and needless to say on Mucuri [indiscernible] shares as we had a significant increase in the price of the stock with the other side of that is that we had to make increases in our allowance results for that in the quarter. We also made adjustments in the launch for result for debt, when it comes to commercial expenses related to paper domestic market. We’re taking all necessary adjustment measures to be able to take full advantage of our full potential and the company is totally in this process of continuing operational gain.</p>
<p>Now speaking about Pulp on the next slide, the good news is that the market is highly demanding of pulp in the last 12 months. We had almost 3.4 million tonnes of pulp than our production in the second quarter it was higher when compared to last year’s production and our sales production was also much higher 16% higher than that of last year, our inventory reduction was 60,000 tonnes during that period this is very positive, inventories are at very low levels which allow us in a timeline to expect further reductions during the period.</p>
<p>In terms of paper what is happening is that we have a production loss related to maintenance downtime in Suzano. This was a one off situation and only happened in the second quarter and we also have a lower domestic market sales was about 6% and you might remember that in the first quarter of this year we referred to a drop of 12% in the first quarter but this now has been reduced down to 6% in the second quarter. Therefore we believe that we will have lot significant drops now already in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Also there was an increase in the average net price that was flat versus first quarter of last year. The difference in the volume of paper production is now being allocated in the domestic market because the volumes are growing to offset reductions in the current market. The cash cost now on Slide 8 we had an increase from 565 to 626 in this quarter vis-à-vis the same quarter of the year before we will see the evolution in wood is the main impact that we have in the past equation and energy is the other element. With wood we have the advanced purchase of third-party wood to supply Mucuri this was a decision by the company and very positive to shareholders. But refer to the decision we made to purchase wood from third-parties another important element is the average distance increase at Maranhão mill this is here to stay and it will not be reverted in the short run.</p>
<p>Now referring to energy there was a difference in price in the submarkets as I mentioned before and also we had an overhaul downtime something that happens once every seven years that is for turbine number five which lowers the volume of exported energy during that quarter. The turbine has resumed operation on July 15 and therefore after that the volume of energy will increase again in the third quarter of this year. We had two downtimes in the quarter. So we should not expect to have any more downtimes in the next stuff and more consumption after the resume.</p>
<p>The company continues to focus on cost and expenses differently. We have record high revenue in the last 12 months. We had 2.69 and our revenue was R$8.7 billion so despite all of the effects that we mentioned before in our nominal COGS between June 14 and June 15 is still low meaning that despite all of the effects we had with wood and energy our cost in nominal terms continues to drop and this is a very positive element and admin expenses this far reached an even lower level accounting for 8.8% over sales. Therefore the focus of the company and the company’s discipline to manage costs and expenses continues to go on and this will give us ever more positive results from now on.</p>
<p>Now referring to investment in the last six months with 945 million and we are now revisiting our CapEx growth for this year for something close to R$1.8 billion, R$1.7 billion and R$1.8 billion part of that the first year purchase of wood from third-party which is quite positive and this will be explained further in the next slide. This is a decision made by the company in view of the positive trend from the market concerning exchanger relation and price of pulp and therefore we decided to exempt the purchase as far as our wood from the third-party to avoid any drastic variation. In addition we are engaged several retrofitting projects in our facilities. The most recent projects approved involve the retrofitting of the digester of Suzano Unit also they are retrofitting of the biomass boiler of the Maranhão Unit and also the purchase of light carrier for vehicles. These are continued programs of the company and we’ll continue to pursue these programs in the next quarters.</p>
<p>The next slide, Slide Number 11, I would like to call your attention to the slide because this is very relevant as to our analysis. This slide shows a comparative analysis on the upper side of the slide we have our cash cost in 2012 and then the cash cost in the last six months of 2015. As you can see the cash cost has progressed the CAGR or the average annual growth was 1.8% a year which was much lower than inflation in the period but more significant than that is the fact that despite the growth below inflation the wood cost was up by R$84, so we grew R$31 in terms of the total cash cost and the wood cost accounted for 84 from the total cost. So out of all the cost we have a nominal drop of R$53 despite inflation and despite the exchange adjustments that we quoted in the six months of 2015. Therefore this as a focus and the discipline of the company towards reducing consumptions in the different mills and this is part of a continuous program. We do that during so two ways one is a program or the managers are totally independent to bring about new ideas and on the other side we also have more encompassing structural programs that are in place in several mills.</p>
<p>Now speaking about wood and this appears on the lower part of the chart all of the effect is concentrated at Mucuri mill, for strategic reasons we were not giving you any disclosure about how we were operating and purchases of wood from third-parties. And the reason for that is that we still have to buy wood from third-parties for the future. As we’re almost concluding that purchase of third-party wood we now today are able to give you the disclosure about the fact that Mucuri -- in Mucuri we went from 98 kilometers of average radius in 2012, as the restructure radius is 95 kilometer so we were above the average radius and today it's 298 kilometers in Mucuri, and this has been impacting our cash cost and that’s why the cash cost as you can see on the upper side of the chart was impact toward in a very relevant way. So we went from 45% of wood from third-party and arrived at 62% of wood from third-party in this lower chart in the first six months of 2015. What I can tell you that after the second half of the year this will drop dramatically. We’ll experience a dramatic drop so far we decided to buy more wood from third-parties and the situation we’ll become more aggregative in the third quarter and fourth quarters of this year, meaning that we’ll be bringing more wood from third-parties to be able to preserve our forest and therefore have a drastic drop of wood from third parties and also the average distance. We made all of the analysis and the return on employee capital is therefore very significant to our shareholders.</p>
<p>And so the good news is that the productivity gains that we’re able to get at Mucuri in a greater old fashion we’ll be able to operate below our structural cash cost in the company for a certain time. So next year we’ll expect a drop for less than half of third-party wood purchases vis-à-vis this would in terms of longer distances and in addition to that we’ll also have a significant productivity gains in our [indiscernible] operation at Mucuri. So we really wanted to disclose these figures and I would like to emphasize that we couldn't disclose it sooner because we still have to buy more wood from third parties and we were afraid that by disclosing it too soon this could impact the prices of wood, but has really almost -- everything we needed, now it is a good time to disclose the numbers. This is a very important chart because that really shows how the company is performing and how important cash cost is for us from now on. We’re making good progress in terms of our industrial cash cost. We also made significant charge towards our harvesting cash cost and third-party wood at Mucuri and the average distance improved by the good news is that in a very short period of time all of this will be reduced and [indiscernible] positive. And just for your knowledge of this really impacted our CapEx because buying more wood from third parties impact OpEx so our impact CapEx and our OpEx because we have to pay more for transportation cost that the short-term combination more than offset the benefit that we will be able to have in the long-term.</p>
<p>The next piece of news I have for you is a third area where we’ll be working in. As I said before in our [indiscernible] one of the period refers to a gradual reduction in our structural cost the second important period of the process refers to a search of new business that can have a good possibility for the future. Businesses that are adjacent to the ones where we are already operating and the asset base is higher than our current asset base. The next that we have in mind is lignin if you look at the lower part of the chart you’ll see the manufacturing, the production process of lignin. The tree consists of lignin in our pulp and we extract lignin and we produce the Black Liquor and we put it in the recovery boiler for burning and energy recovery. The idea now is to take this business and turn it into silicon products that can replace the carbon chain of oil.</p>
<p>What we are doing is quite positive we already have several applications which are rubber, phenolic resins cement additives which would have a return, the first half of the return of energy. Now we made a unit, we anticipate a scale up of 20 months on the pilot plant we had a very small plant of onetime a day and we will upgrade to a plant of 20,000 tonnes a year and this capacity will happen in the next 12 months with the CapEx of 70 million approximately. This is quite significant because it accounts for 2 tonnes more of this oil of energy that we have in terms of return on capital employed the good piece of news is that those projects and other projects in the projects at [indiscernible] and the three adjacent that we already have today we have high scalability with the projects that allow us to bring higher volumes in the future especially in lignin our potential in all of the plants if we fully operate with investments in all trends we will be able to have approximately 185,000 tonnes of lignin. This is a new product. This is an innovation as presented this is part of DNA and this is part of our concept innovation program and we are now introducing this new program to the market and that was a decision by the Board.</p>
<p>With that I conclude our presentation and myself and my team are now available to take your questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we will now initiate our Q&amp;A session. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Caio Ribeiro from BTG Pactual.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Caio Ribeiro</span></strong></p>
<p>I have two questions, first if you can comment on the short-term scenario for pulp. Now looking towards the next few months, how do you see demand in the different regions and whether you also see any room for further pricing increases? Also could you please comment on [indiscernible] depreciation from China that we saw recently whether you see any impact on the supply and demand demographics? Secondly about the paper market, how do you see the evolution in the short run and what are the expectations in terms of closing the domestic demand for this year and whether you see any room for increases in paper?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Anibal</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Carlos Anibal. Thank you for your question Caio currently our view is very positive in terms of the basics because they fully support the current price in our market the global demand grew by 4% because it grew 19% and inventories are at their very lowest 31 days even though there is no new capacity in the last few months, but there is one thing that may change the market dynamics in the next few months which is the situation as we go. I’ll just briefly comment on the different elements and at the end I will refer to the question about renminbi. So in the second quarter we experienced a growth of 2.7% of pulp demand growth an increase of 3.2% growth vis-à-vis the first quarter so the year-to-date growth is 4%. We also see a strong demand of pulp from eucalyptus in the last six months the growth was 7%, China performed well in the first half of the year growing 2% vis-à-vis the same period of last year eucalyptus was the highlight because it grew 17%. In July demand was quite robust in all regions and the volumes performed as expected in the area we have the closing of the business in August so once again we have the very positive of this market. When it comes to [indiscernible] in the first half of the year we had an operating rate of 2 percentage points above the numbers of the same period as the last year before hardwood in June in terms of CapEx was about 101% and this shows the clear perception of our robust performance of eucalyptus pulp in the Northern Hemisphere that contributed to our lower inventory.</p>
<p>[Indiscernible] is a plant of 1,600,000 tonnes located in Shandong two lines one line of 1.5 million that started up in the last quarter of 2010 the plant is located in the midst of [indiscernible] the plant is supplied by water coming from our Artesian Well the region has been severely affected in the last few months for a lack of windfall and as a consequence the availability of water was quite low, so today the local model is trying to deal with those low availability to supply the population, therefore the local government decided to stop their small line of 300,000 tonnes in the first part of June and the second line of 1.5 million in the second half of the month. There are a lot of rumors about the starting up again of that unit, whether [indiscernible] will be resumed by October until the conclude the construction of a new canal that will pump water into the region but there is also another rumor that says that the plant should be resumed any minute because of the strong rainfall of the last few days.</p>
<p>But again there are many uncertainties that I believe that what is more important regardless our plant in China is that the investments will be able to support all of the prices, the current prices and the only the other aspect is that, we’re closing businesses in China at price levels that were part of our plan inventories again are low in all June, the industry and producers have low inventories our clients have low inventories 38 days of short wood in my understanding is a very low number at the end of June. So 38 days is the lowest number in the five years, in the last five years I think we had 4 million to 5 million tonnes in addition that should probably increase that number of balance of inventories of short wood. So [indiscernible] again is a very low inventory level. We had a reduction of 60,000 tonnes of inventories in the first half of the year in the second quarter we showed everything we produce we are operating with inventories at very low levels, much lower than we would like to be operating with. Current prices today are 810, the lowest price in Europe, 700 in Asia and U.S. and once there is a positive reading. Prices are supported by our fundamentals in China in the last few days. We had an increase of about $20-$30 of prices in the spot market of short wood. And that was also due to [indiscernible].</p>
<p>Now about, the Yuan the Chinese currency we had 2% to 4% depreciation in the past few days and [indiscernible] prices are managed according to the client demand as it happened in the beginning of the year in Europe price has changed. So I don't see in the short run any impact to depreciation of the renminbi well we’ll have differences in the Chinese prices but we’ll benefit from import China export more than 2 million tonnes of paper. So in the short run I don't see any major impacts coming from [indiscernible]. But it is important that we keep monitoring this relationship between hardwood and short wood and also it's important that we monitor the margins of [indiscernible] we have in wood any -- we haven't experienced such significant pressure as we’re seeing today, in the case of paper demand continues to be impacted by the macroeconomic situation and this was mentioned earlier on in the presentation there was a drop of 7.5% in the demand of the products that we sell, well it was lower than the 12% that we posted in the first quarter that was also a better performance in our market in terms of printing and writing paper in the second quarter the performance was very positive there was also an assessment of [indiscernible] of the volume of the national program of textbooks, and particularly we may see a stronger trend in the next few months which refers to gains of market share, so we gained market share in the second quarter, but we believe that we’ll continue to gain more market share in the forthcoming quarters in [indiscernible] by 31% in the last quarter vis-à-vis the second quarter earlier before in July, coated paper which was the both of our export/import was down year-to-date by 35%. July 2015 and July 2014 had a 60% reduction.</p>
<p>So once again we are prepared to observe this decrease -- increasing our sales and as a consequence we will then increase our market share. We are also taking advantage of the good exchange momentum. We grew volume in the second quarter vis-à-vis the first quarter of this year and also vis-à-vis the second quarter of 2014. Therefore for the third quarter in terms of export we anticipate stronger export stronger than the second quarter and stronger when compared to the third quarter of the year before. We are announcing tiers of price increases as of August 1st. The increase [indiscernible] by 9.5% as of September 1st we will also increase by approximately 10% our non-coated paper to 7 and as of September we also increase the price of paperboard therefore our strategy is well elaborated looking our metrics product channel and this is aiming at having a successful operation as we had in these areas. We see the need coming from demand but we can support this increase in the domestic market and this also brings about another addition on incentives coming from more exports.</p>
<p>So at the current exchange rate we have a large volume of our exports based on this current exchange rate but we still have more [indiscernible] and secured. Therefore we see good opportunities to be more rigorous in this implementation. We won’t be able to [indiscernible] capture all of this potential but there is a deployment curve that will certainly assure of the gradual recovery of our prices in the next months and next quarters. We had a gain of 5.5% in the second quarter versus the second quarter of 2014 in the domestic market. Those gains could have been higher if we’re not for the mix that we have, we had a great variation in our sales mix. So paper on the demand side we do not anticipate any improvement at least for the moment and in our period that -- our chains are still working with very lower visibility in terms of future demand that’s why I would rather not be committed to any demand projection for the end of 2015, but on the other hand we will certainly feel greater discipline to start implementing the announced prices.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Mr. Lucas Ferreira from JPMorgan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lucas Ferreira</span></strong></p>
<p>I also have two questions and the first refers to production cost. It was very clear that 50 million is a one-off impact [indiscernible] settled in the quarter and so the cost should come down in the second half of the year I think this is the major reading I just want to understand whether my reading isn’t affected now. The stock price is close to R$100 and lower now in the second quarter -- at the end of the second quarter and the impact coming from the exchange rate. So my question is can we conclude that your cost of production of pulp should be nominally lower in the second half of the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Walter Schalka</span></strong></p>
<p>Lucas, this is Walter. Now our cost should still rise in the second half of the year and the reason for that is what I explained earlier during my presentation it is because we’ll still bring more wood from third party at Mucuri and this will affect our cash cost through wood in terms of chemicals consumption we’re evolving, this will bring us an increase in the second half of the year. The cash cost is up next year we experienced a significant drop also second half of next year because we have a significant amount of third-party wood but we will see an increase, one-off increase in the cash cost in the second quarter, stemming from a larger volume of the third party wood. Well, we have available wood to cut a [indiscernible] at Mucuri, but what we want is to preserve that Mucuri were to reduce with the average radius quicker next year and in terms of energy as you mentioned is something that depends on pricing -- in terms of energy volume our export position is likewise of energy and currently in July and August prices just fails about R$130 per megawatt. We do not know how it will perform because it varies week-on-week. But we are now buying future to us as in a unit taking the advantage of the current situation of the market. Right now also we’re buying future energy to preserve exports going to market in the next coming years.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lucas Ferreira</span></strong></p>
<p>I have another question related to working capital in this quarter I think great part of that was due to your receivables accounted exchange variations et cetera, can you elaborate more on that or what do you expect for the second half of the year or you anticipate any just as any other variation?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marcelo Bacci</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, this is Marcelo Bacci, this is [indiscernible] both the exchange rate and price in the case of pulp are rising and this is causing working capital to perform as such, considering current market conditions that should continue to in the third quarter by for these reasons and this also means that we’ll have better process in our business.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Marcos Assumpção, Itaú BBA.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marcos Assumpção</span></strong></p>
<p>My first question refers to the wood selling in Maranhão. You talked about Mucuri, but can you give me any visibility in terms of the percentage of third party wood and the average radius for 2015, and 2016. How should we expect the progress to occur and also I would like Carlos to talk about allowance reduction debt, you referred to the domestic market therefore we’re talking about paper prices, is that [indiscernible] increase more our focus on this first half of the year or do you think that this will continue and we should be alert? And also I would like you to compare that with other critical moments that occurred in the domestic market or whether this is a normal level and we shouldn't be so concerned.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Walter Schalka</span></strong></p>
<p>Marcos good morning this is Walter, I will talk about wood in Maranhão. And thank you for your partition. Wood in Maranhão we’ll have a contribution from third-parties in the second quarter of 30%, and this number from third party should continue to be the same in the next quarter. So it's nothing that indicates any changes the trend is very similar and the average rate is in Maranhão should we change in a significant way in the next coming quarters. We’re increasing our forestry base in Maranhão we’re planting closer and this is something that we’ll be able to get the effect further on but in the short run, we do not see any relevant effect in Maranhão.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marcelo Bacci</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Marcelo Marcos, referring to our allowance for doubtful debt, we only have some one-off situation thus what was an increase in ADD that was about R$6 million in the first half of the year which is not very relevant, so this is a matter of concern to us the chain has been pressured by low volume so we have low availability of credit in the market for all kinds of credit especially regarding midsize company in the paper industry therefore we've been concerned but we haven't noticed any relevant effect to-date. But this has narrating our attention.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marcos Assumpção</span></strong></p>
<p>I just have a follow-up question about wood Walter, looking forward and taken into account your current forestry base, so is this normal level in terms of third-party wood 30% from third parties and the remaining will be your own wood or you think that this ratio should change as you look at the mid and long range?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Walter Schalka</span></strong></p>
<p>Now I think this is the normal range, maybe a little bit less wood from third parties but this is a normalized figure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marcos Assumpção</span></strong></p>
<p>Just one last follow-up with this current profitability level that we see today as we have been in the industry as a whole that the cash generation that you currently how do you see your return on invested capital of the company. I remember that you questioned a return of the industry but do you believe that at these levels return is satisfactory or return on employee capital currently very positive.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Walter Schalka</span></strong></p>
<p>Well we've to understand capital [indiscernible] has being something that is denominated in reals but part of it should be denominated in dollars because the refer to how investments denominated in U.S. dollar but we’re pricing it in real, and then the capital employed of today at the exchange rate and the pulp price that we have today the returns are very positive but the issue how refers how sustainable this is in the long run we’re adopting a very clear strategy and also quite positive to the market. And first that refers to a continued reduction of our cost throughout time, therefore we don't believe that we still have room for further cost reductions and we’re working in projects to meet that goal those in terms of forestry coming from harvest and forestry logistics as well as a the industrial side and others. So therefore we’re declined several options on the other hand we've to look for adjacent businesses that go add value to our asset base. A combination of all of these activities we would provide us apparently this is very positive but we have to be humble to understand that considering the industry as of yesterday we have to look for sustainable growth instead of only celebrating one-off situations and good returns of capital employed we have to be prepared for the future that’s why we are very determined to go to that direction. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Viccenzo Patemostro from Credit Suisse.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Viccenzo Patemostro</span></strong></p>
<p>My first question refers to CapEx, CapEx related to wood at Mucuri mill. I don’t know whether you can give me more details about how you calculated the CapEx and how can we calculate that in terms of positive return and if you increase by 300 million CapEx and at first this purchase with the purchase of wood, so is it possible to say that in the next few year we will see lower CapEx because we will no longer have to buy wood in the future or can you also give me an idea of how much that will be possible for reducing the cost of pulp in Mucuri. So this is my first question. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Walter Schalka</span></strong></p>
<p>Viccenzo this is Walter. Good morning and thank you for the question. In addition of investment of wood in Mucuri it’s about R$100 million in addition to -- I mean it’s higher than was anticipated before. Our sustained CapEx will still remain in the same level of 1 million or 1.1 million. So this is our sustained CapEx and this is for current and it will continue to have a difference between both CapEx and the total CapEx comes from two different lines one refers to purchases of third party wood and we have a high number this year and in addition we are also having another R$100 million and the other part which is not irrelevant but quite relevant refers to the retrofitting of our operations that will bring a return of capital employed of at least 20% in order to capture that in your model I think you may consider that we have approximately today a wood consumption in Mucuri of about 6.5 million cubic meters lower. And this 6.5 million cubic meter as the years also consider the average distance from 2009 until now by 200 kilometers it includes the 200 kilometers but once it comes down with time we will go down decrease another 200 kilometers. Therefore we will come down by 200 and some kilometers in terms of reduction. If you analyze the impact of that you will then have the impact of cash cost at Mucuri and this will also have an impact on the total cash cost of the company.</p>
<p>In terms of CapEx just to clarify I think that the number is 1.5 million and about 1.1 million was recurrent or sustained and the 400 million in higher return projects that you talked about this all now, the number is 1.7 and 1.8. So 100 million refers to wood and the difference refers to new higher return projects. [Indiscernible] yes it was [indiscernible] and now is 1.7 or 1.8 depending on the volume of wood and the [indiscernible] of which the projects are deployed and the difference between [indiscernible] reducing your level means some part comes from wood and the other part comes from other projects with higher return.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Viccenzo Patemostro</span></strong></p>
<p>My second question is about the capital allocation. After recent allocation I’m assuming that the exchange rate will be as it is today and by the end of the year your debt level is low. So for next year debt level I mean would you expect to have high cash generation. I just wanted to understand whether you can tell me about thinking about priority cash or allocation of cash whether you have some project in mind or if you have any project being currently analyzed or whether you intend to pay the most expensive debt or increase dividend. I just want to have an idea about your cash generation for next year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marcelo Bacci</span></strong></p>
<p>Viccenzo this is Marcelo yes we will see an acceleration of the net debt over EBITDA ratio so next year we are focusing on the strategic areas. First additional projects that can be deployed to improve the long-term return of our assets bottleneck et cetera we’re looking into the several alternatives that can be implemented next year also we see some investment alternatives that can help us to reduce even further the average radius of our operations we will continue to invest in adjacencies in products like the new that was announced today and that investment will take place next year. So we [indiscernible] this is what we’re looking at and either we do not intend to do [indiscernible] or a line duplication or anything like because we still believe that direct return ratio of these projects is not adequate yet, and if we had adequate market conditions the return will be good but slight changes in market condition can really change the return and it could defer materially from what we might have expected. Increasing dividend is another possibility the trend is that we’ll recover anytime a dividend payout that would be more in keeping with the historical dividend yield of the company in the last three years we paid out very low amount. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Our next question is from Thiago Lofiego from Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Thiago Lofiego</span></strong></p>
<p>I have two questions concerning cost. How much of that variation of R$61 per tonne in your cost with no downtime is recurrent? If you can give me the numbers in real per tonne and how much of the downtime cost which was R$36 per tonne how much of this 36 is out of the curve for a downturn? I would just like you to elaborate more on that. And now we’re visiting the average ratios, can you please reinstate the actual number for the average radius for Mucuri and whether you can quantify the impact. And my last question if you allow me refers to capital allocation going back to Viccenzo’s question the acquisition in other non-pulp market is there a possibility that you would look at other paper markets in Brazil just in terms of [indiscernible] rationale?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Walter Schalka</span></strong></p>
<p>You are talking about our cash cost, I would just like to elaborate on that. Our cash cost is 626 and the 594 year-to-date, the cash cost in the third and fourth of this year should increase and the only two reasons and the main reasons are increases in the average distance in Mucuri and the decrease in energy prices is the main reason. And as of the third quarter of next year we’ll see a drastic drop in the average distance of the Mucuri forest. We acquired third party wood and we’ll start cutting early this year in the end of -- early next year and the end of this year and then as of the second half of next year we’ll have very little wood to acquire, that’s why we should expect a very strong drop as of the second half of next year and cost of wood in Mucuri and cash cost in Mucuri and the general cash cost of the company. So I would like to reiterate that this is a deliberate decision of the company in terms of the wood operation, because further on we’ll experience insignificant drop, our structural cash cost is certainly lower than the cash cost that we have today.</p>
<p>Today' cash cost have a significant burden coming from wood in Mucuri and this impacts our cash cost that’s why we see an evolution from 2012 to-date, in terms of capital allocation which was also part of your question. Marcelo said that we’ll look at the other structural projects towards the future, both in terms of forestry and industry and it's possible to assume an increase in dividend payouts because I think we have to remunerate our shareholders accordingly considering our cash generation but even then we’ll have a significant deleveraging we’ll start paying the most expensive debt, the reduction of our cash level -- we've a policy to reduce the cash level of the company because while we've the [indiscernible] project we decided to have a higher cash position but today given the fact that the company promoted a deleveraging this is no longer necessary therefore we’ll probably reduce our cash position.</p>
<p>We’re also looking at the redesign of the industry which in the third pillar of our strategy, there are several alternatives about how we’ll allocate capital in the future, I have always been very clear with the market saying that we would not look at M&amp;A as long as two other proceeding conditions were established, the first being an increase in the value of the share, we thought that the share is not really quite represented the value of the company but now the value of the start increase significantly, certainly I will not comment on what I think will happen to the price of the stock because it is not up to me to say that. And the other issue is, is that our debt position now is much better than what we had before and this is happening gradually we went from 5.2 and now is 3 and with the relevant trend towards the next quarter. Therefore our position will be much more comfortable as of next year and this is about to discuss more encompassing issues related to the industry we design.</p>

<p>Our next question is from Alan Glezer from Bradesco.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alan Glezer</span></strong></p>
<p>I have two questions, the first about paper. We know that the 20% increase in the domestic market this quarter at the same time imports are following I would like to understand whether you see any more room to gain share from your other products considering current measures where importers are squeezed with the current exchange rate or whether you saw some movement on other players in terms of increasing prices as you said that you will do in August and September the other prices will also go in that same direction. This is my first question. The second question refers to the original loss we saw increase of sales to Europe do you believe that there has helped your effective cost and whether this should maintained throughout the second half of the year? Thank you. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Anibal</span></strong></p>
<p>Alan, good morning, this is Carlos Anibal. Thank you for your questions. We experienced a significant drop especially in July, especially in coated paper 67% vis-à-vis the same period of last year, and coated paper is the bulk of our experts so certainly we’ve been able to gain market share in the second quarter and we are considering the fact that we do believe that we will continue to gain market share in the second half of this year. Our contribution has increased our share has increased when compared to what we had last year. What I have been hearing from our clients and competitors is that some of them have already increased their prices. Therefore I think it’s natural that they do it especially the non-integrated producers they are suffering with margin pressures due to a significant increase in the price of pulp in the last few months. In terms of pulp we have a geographic mix and we experienced a growth coming from Europe and a decrease coming from Asia. Thus far we have to look at that every quarter there are variations due to our commercial strategy and our volume availability. Therefore I think that our expectation is that we will continue to operate with the mix very close to the mix that we had in the last 12 months. There is nothing that could justify stronger contribution coming or [indiscernible] share coming from China or Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Now we conclude the Q&amp;A session. I would like to give the floor to the officers of the company for the final remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Walter Schalka</strong></p>
<p>This is Walter. I would like to thank you very much for participating in this conference call. I would like to say that the company is very pleased with some of the results that we had this quarter. The operational cash flow of the company is growing significantly the deleveraging of the company is also taking place. The progress in our operating unit is bringing about better results. Our investment as a whole have giving us returns on the capital employed even higher than what we planned. We are also progressing in terms of our relationships with our employees. We are training them, educating them, giving them better conditions in our plants. We are working in a very encompassing way to improve IT. We are introducing liability management progress in terms of our relationship with our customers we still see room for future improvement. Therefore I am very pleased to see how the company is performing. But I’m also very humbled to recognize that our results were below our potential in the second quarter. But we are working hard to change that situation. So we build that situation. I believe that the transparency that we always pursued with shareholders, investors, analyst, banks and the society as a whole is what will certainly prevail in the company and this has become a very positive move on the part of the company. So my final message is very positive. The company has gone through a very positive moment and especially towards the future we see very positive days. And thank you very much for your participation. And Michelle and Marcelo will be available further on -- later on to answer questions that you may still have. Thank you very much, and have a good day.</p>
