<p><strong>Michael Hession</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Michael. Hello, everyone and thank you for joining InterOil’s second quarter call today. The achievement of important milestones with the LNG project and pricing appraisal results at Elk-Antelope and PRL 15 are among features of our second quarter. Additionally, we have maintained a healthy finance position as we have worked on our discoveries and opportunities at Elk-Antelope and PRL 15. Today, we will touch on each of these elements.</p>
<p>First, the Papua LNG development, our latest operational results continue to excite us and have confirmed our confidence that Elk-Antelope can support two trains. This confidence is driven by data. For example, we now have more than 1,350 hours of flow test data from Elk-Antelope. Therefore, the insights we present today are based on substantial information and data. Our latest downhole pressure measurements from flow testing at Antelope demonstrate a clear connectivity across the reservoir. That is we see no evidence of compartmentalization either horizontally or laterally. The testing also shows a world class multi-darcy reservoir with strong deliverability which will favorably affect reservoir with strong deliverability, which will basically affect the number of wells needed for production.</p>
<p>In addition to our flow testing, the PRL 15 joint venture selected sites of the Papua LNG project in the middle of the year. This milestone was reached on schedule and continued the venture’s good progress to develop Elk-Antelope. The project potentially below the cost-neutral LNG development broadly is now entering basis of drilling with Total as the operator. David Kirk, our Senior Vice President of Development and Drilling will expand on this shortly. And secondly, Saxon Palmer, our Senior Vice President of Exploration will discuss our exploration and appraisal activities outside of PRL 15, including Triceratops and Wahoo. Finally, Don Spector, our Chief Financial Officer will review our financial position and priority for capital allocation.</p>
<p>At the end of the second quarter, we had a healthy liquidity position of more than $0.5 billion. And as we look ahead, we also expect a material specification payment from Total in mid-2016 after we complete the Elk-Antelope appraisal program. This will provide long-term funding for our offshore LNG project and will support the execution of our strategy. While we have a robust balance sheet, we remain disciplined about capital allocation while streamlining our organization to account for Total becoming operator for PRL15 and we are prioritizing investment on proving up our revenues.</p>
<p>And with that, I will hand over to David whose team has been making a word on developing Elk-Antelope. Over to you, David.</p>
<p><strong>David Kirk</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Michael. First, we will provide a brief overview on Slide 5 of our testing program at Elk-Antelope and the insights we have drawn from the data. We will then talk about progress in the Papua LNG project and its indicative economics. Before I begin, it may help to note something of my background as well as recap on our leaders’ agreeable drilling program. After a period with back-tail on LNG construction way back in 1982, I moved into the upstream operator side, in which I have spent 30 years working on megaprojects we are getting resource volumes cracked at tremendous value. With that foremost in our mind, we assembled at InterOil a first-class subsurface team working within the rigorous assurance process, involving peer reviews by independent industry experts.</p>
<p>To start, I will recap on the appraisal drilling campaign at Elk-Antelope. As a reminder, Antelope-5 actually came in 230 meters or 750 feet above our reference case and uncovered some of the best reservoir in the field. This new data increased our understanding of reservoir size and quality in the western flank. However, we had only initial surface data from the clean up flow test at Antelope-5 when we showed this material in June. Today, we will show more data to expand on the Antelope 3.</p>
<p>Let’s turn to Slide 6 for context by the Antelope field testing program. In June, we set precision downhole pressure and temperature gauges in Antelope-5 and reentered the old Antelope-1 well, 2.5 kilometers from Antelope-5. We also set precision gauges there in preparation for an interference test between wells. As Antelope-1 is only open across the lower limestone interval, we were able to record lateral and vertical pressure changes across the layers of the reservoir. We flowed Antelope-5 to four different choke sizes over 72 hours, following this with a 5-day buildup to measure downhole pressure changes. We describe Antelope-5 as the producing well, because we produce gas from it and Antelope-1 as a listening well, because we use that to measure for pressure response. When Antelope-4 is completed, we plan to also use it as a listening well as part of a larger interference testing program.</p>
<p>Today, we will explain the insights we have taken from the Antelope-5 and the Antelope-1 data as shown on Slide 7. At our annual meeting, we discussed the extra reservoir qualities of Antelope-5 as indicated by the pressure response data reported at surface in addition to wireline log and the core data from the well. Since then, we have recovered the downhole pressure gauges from both Antelope-5 and Antelope-1 which is the lightest analyzed bottom hole pressure responses. This is a very important distinction. While surface data is extremely useful in the absence of anything else, it is impacted by pressure losses within the wellbore itself as fluid enters the well from the reservoir and flow at the surface, thus introducing some uncertainty. Bottom hole pressure and temperature data reduces uncertainty.</p>
<p>On this slide, we have readings of bottom hole pressure changes at Antelope-5 gauges during the flow test. Bottom hole pressure shown in green dropped at Antelope-5 as we increased the flow rate shown in red, but bottom hole flowing pressure should drop as we progressively opened the well through different choke sizes, we did not expect such a tiny pressure drop, only two pines per square inch as shown in the graph between the initial pressure and 3,536 psi to a final flowing pressure of 3,534 psi at the maximum choke setting. As I said, this change is tiny and even better than other Antelope wells which had impressively low drawdowns of between 10 and 5 psi during flow testing.</p>
<p>I should point out the small pressure drop for a large flow rate is a very good thing. Hanging is even better. When we shut in the well after the flow rate, the bottom hole pressure recovered almost immediately throughout the pressure. This tiny drop in pressure when flowing and rapid recovery when shut-in, confirms the world class reservoir permeability and well deliverability. Permeability, which describes the ability of the reservoir to allowing gas to pass through it, is commonly measured from tens to hundreds of millidarcies. In the case of Antelope reservoir, we are dealing with millidarcy permeability, an order of magnitude greater than its column. Detailed analysis of the Antelope-5 pressure response data across the flowing and shut-in periods using different analytical techniques gives us confidence that the volumes seen by the Antelope-5 test supports a 2 trillion project.</p>
<p>Now, the question of compartmentalization has been raised in the past. The outstanding results from Antelope-5 and consistent gas compositions and pressure data across the field do not suggest any compartmentalization. But if there is any compartmentalization, then the compartment accessed by Antelope-5 is huge and any other gas compartments will be most welcomed. Actually, I apologize there is one other compartment that we do know of. The Elk field is separate to Antelope and the volumes in Elk therefore are in addition to the volumes seen by Antelope-5.</p>
<p>Slide 8 illustrates pressures from data at Antelope-1, the listening well, where we detected clear pressure changes after flowing Antelope-5, the producing well. The response on normal scale as shown on the top right graph is indiscernible, because it is so small. But when we magnified the scale, we can see the pressure data variation. Analysis of this pressure data supports the data, an analysis we have done at Antelope-5 and tells us three key things.</p>
<p>First, we saw within 20 hours of flowing Antelope-5 a pressures response 2.5 kilometers away at Antelope-1, which demonstrates the strong connectivity between these two wells. Second, the gauges in Antelope-1 were in the lower limestone only, so we were able to test lateral and vertical connectivity across the reservoir. And third, the pressure data we recorded at Antelope-1 gives us another means to support calculation of a minimum recoverable volume, which was consistent with our analysis of the Antelope-5 data and the two three scenario.</p>
<p>Finally, on Slide 9, we have flooded pressure reading against flow rates from Antelope wells in comparison to data from the prolific Arun gas field in Indonesia. Readings towards the lower right side of the graph indicates better fluid performance. In other words, wells at the highest flow rates for the lowest pressure draw-downs are the most productive. Arun was a giant carbonate field that mobile discovered in 1971 and developed as a 6-train LNG project. When Arun started export in 1971, it puts Indonesia on the map as an LNG producer. Geologically, Arun is considered to being amongst the world’s best producing carbonate fields. We believe it is a good analogue for Antelope. And as to be seeing the flock, the Antelope wells are at least as productive as Arun with Antelope side being the standout. Antelope has the characteristics of being a world-class field. The well there has data point to a reservoir that is likely to meet only a few wells to meet production targets.</p>
<p>Now to Slide 10 for a quick update on progress with the Papua LNG project. In early July, the PRL 15 joint venture unanimously agreed on occasions for the project’s three key infrastructure components. The second processing facility will be in the Gulf region near Elk-Antelope and flows to the Purari River for easy access. And the 340-kilometer pipeline corridor to the plant will include onshore and offshore pipelines for both gas and condensate. The LNG plant will be at Caution Bay by 25 kilometers northwest of Port Moresby and next to ExxonMobil’s PNG LNG plant. The site provides geographical, operational and financial advantages and we are pleased that the Papua New Guinea government has welcomed debentures decision. Earlier last week, we announced the transition of PRL 15 operatorship to Total. We welcome the global LNG experience that Total brings and we look forward to supporting them as we move through the major LNG development stages, the business of design, content engineering design, early works and, of course, a final investment decision.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we continue to finalize appraisal drilling and you may recall we have had positive indications already from Antelope-4, which has resumed operations. With all lines expanding to the very top of the reservoir, we are keen to drill the total depth in this well. We have only a few hundred meters to go and then we will then move on to Antelope-6 where the site is near completion. We expect to spud that well later this year.</p>
<p>Before we wrap up on the Papua LNG project, let’s revisit some of the key economics of the project against global peers on Slide 11. The charts on this page shows two important metrics: rates of return and breakeven gas price for competing projects. This data is taken directly from Wood Mackenzie, which initiated coverage of the Papua LNG project last week announced with the site collection. According to Wood Mackenzie, the Papua LNG project is the highest returning Greenfield project. Papua LNG also enjoys the second global free-on-board breakeven gas price after Cameron LNG in the U.S. Keep in mind, the leading U.S. projects on these charts are existing import terminals that are being converted for export. So, they do not have the same cost base of the new build developments. Projects that foreshadow high returns and the low breakeven gas price are attractive to LNG customers and financiers, particular when they are close to markets. As we have said before, low-cost projects tend to go first and we are confident in Total’s ability to develop Papua LNG according to schedule.</p>
<p>With that, I will pass over to Saxon.</p>
<p><strong>Saxon Palmer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, David. Slide 12 is about one of our discoveries that we’re re-pricing, Triceratops-3 and PRL 39, in which we have a 69.1% interest. This is a commitment well under our license conditions targeted a significant carbonate buildup in Triceratops-2. In the original work by GLJ Petroleum Consultants, Triceratops was given a contingent P50 resource volume of about 400 Bcfe or less than half a Tcf equivalent. Triceratops-3 will further appraise the field. And based on our license estimate, has the potential to more than double the contingent resource volume. This is important because the field would tie back to an LNG development. Earlier today, we reached total depth of 2,090 meters, having recovered 13 meters of core and preparation for logging is now underway. Given this encouraging results, we will further appraise the field.</p>
<p>Let’s turn to Slide 13, Wahoo. Wahoo was designed to test whether the successful PRL 15 trend extended 170 kilometers southeast into a frontier exploration area. As previously announced in July 2014, Wahoo-1 was suspended due to unexpectedly high pressures and gas. In June 2015, we re-entered Wahoo-1 and sidetracked to investigate a seismically identified target horizon we interpreted to be carbonate reservoir. The maximum depth reached by sidetrack operations was 1,589 meters measured depth. This was below where the target design was interpreted and no carbonate was intersected. The well is now being plugged and abandoned. We previously indicated Wahoo with a high risk target, but it was a well we wanted to drill. Although reservoir was not present at the target horizon within the Wahoo structure, the well has provided valuable information which will assist in evaluating future targets in this front area. We have confirmed a working hydrocarbon kitchen, the presence of thermogenic gas and an effective seal in the Orubadi mudstone.</p>
<p>With that, I will turn over to our CFO, Don for an update on our financial position on Slide 14. Don?</p>
<p><strong>Don Spector</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Saxon and welcome to everyone listening to today’s presentation. Before I go to our consolidated income statement on Slide 14, there have been a number of significant events from a financial perspective that have occurred since the release of our first quarter results. Firstly, with the formal transfer of operatorship to Total on the August 1, our company is now in the process of streamlining the organization to more closely aligned with the loan of a non-operator with Papua LNG project. We expect these changes to be implemented throughout the second half of this year. Secondly, the PRL 15 joint venture has appointed financial and legal advisors for the project financing for the Papua LNG project.</p>
<p>Thirdly, during the period leading up to the receipt of a certification payment on Total next year, outside PRL 15 our capital will be prioritized to proving up 15 discovered resources. This is an important metric consolidating account strength we have in the funding position. And then finally, if we refer back to our previous comments on deductions in the user costs for our activities, to-date on seismic we have seen a 39% improvement in bridging connection, a 37% improvement in the short haul drilling and a 23% improvement in recording productivity. It translates through a seismic cost per kilometer by 20%. And in addition to the new hiring, we have also reduced our headcount by 11% since the beginning of this year.</p>
<p>If we now move on to our financials, our company returned a loss of $32.3 million for the quarter. The majority of the loss is made out from the reversal of $25.9 million of interest income recognized on accretion of a certification payment to be received in Total. This adjustment is required with the certification timing expected to be received by mid-2016.</p>
<p>Moving to our liquidity position at the end of the quarter, which is set out on Slide #15. You will see from the slide that we finished the second quarter with liquidity of $541 million. Expenditures for the quarter consisted of $65 million for drilling and testing on Antelope-4, Antelope-5, the Wahoo sidetrack and Triceratops-3 as well as site preparation for Antelope-6. Those $40 million seismic activities, conceptual studies in PRL 15, inventory and other corporate costs, plus we also have a positive working capital adjustment that reduced our net spend for the quarter by $18 million. With the PRL 15 joint venture improving the sidetrack for Antelope-4 and forecast expenditure for this year will be now in the range of $290 million to $320 million, plus we also have the redemption of the convertible notes of $70 million in November. As I mentioned earlier, inventory in the second half of this year with liquidity of $541 million. It is pleasing to say that our company continues to be in a very strong position financially as we are very closer to the development of the Papua LNG project.</p>
<p>Along that note, I will hand you back to Michael for summary on Slide 16.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Hession</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Don. In summary, we are making great progress on Elk-Antelope appraisal and project development. In particular, we are hugely encouraged by what our sub-services we are seeing within Elk-Antelope. We believe the data confirms we have sufficient gas for two trains. LNG project milestones continued to be met. The sites are completed and basic design underway with Total as the operator. We also note further confirmation of the robust economic to the Papua LNG project from Wood Mackenzie. Outside of Elk-Antelope, we have exciting prospects on discoveries that were driving towards monetization as part of our strategy to build long-term value to the shareholders. For example, we are encouraged by early results from Triceratops-3, which could add to our resource base.</p>
<p>On the operations front, we are also encouraged by continuous improvement in our drilling performance. Triceratops was drilled from spuds to total depth in 59 days, the most drills in country by this rig. So, our mantra of having the right team with the right equipment and the right planning, we are delighted to see a positive improvement in our drilling performance, and finally, to our financial standing. We are prioritizing our capital allocation on discovery resources and continue to maintain the financial discipline as we execute our strategy. As you know, this strategy is about finding hydrocarbons enabling their development with a wide prowess of maintaining a material interest in that development and then completing that project.</p>
<p>With that, we are happy to take your questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Evan Calio from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Evan Calio</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, good evening guys. My first question is really a disclosure strategy question. I know you actually collect more data you have talked about Elk-Antelope now supported by data with the giant you have confirmed two train potentials and making the room comparison more pointedly today. Yet, I guess my question is how do you think about the asymmetry of information between Total and the public shareholders as we progress through the appraisal results period and should we expect or what’s the consideration to putting a finer point range on the resource prior to final certification?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Evan, first of all, hello, how are you doing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Evan Calio</span></strong></p>
<p>I am good.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Good. That’s an excellent question. And the asymmetry of information is something that we thought hard about. We did the venture and actually we did enjoy. Really when it comes down to the data, as I have said before, we are a data-driven company and what we will do, we will release the data that as we go through this appraisal program and that data will tell the story. And we will let our shareholders and the market see the data as it comes in. So you saw at the Annual General Meeting, we released the flow data, the surface flow data and the sort of conclusion is one can drill from that. Now, with this call tonight, we have taken a step further and we released the information between – since the end of the meeting, which is the downhole data. Downhole data is generally it is more reliable. Now we have put those numbers down, we have been very specific with the graphs, we have been very specific with the numbers and people can draw their own conclusions. Some of the equations that you can use are barriers of entry and people can work out there with what the data is and make their decisions on the relative value of what we have got in the portfolio. So, it comes back to releasing data and showing people our conclusions are absolutely based on data. And with that, we think we have reduced the isometric nature of the information. I guess what you are talking about is the asymmetry that potentially other than to the ventures would have more data. Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Evan Calio</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I think that’s helpful and I look forward to that progression. My second question is on timing. And here, just trying to square the circle a little bit. I know before, you had targeted I think payment in the first quarter of 2016. Today, you are talking about the second quarter of 2016 and then you all said the Triceratops, at least the operational performance there and the speed of the drilling being much faster than the prior wells. So maybe if you can – and maybe if I talk in there in Antelope 7 well, is that something that’s in consideration that’s hopeful at the timing shift or is it just consistent with what you have discussed before?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Let me take this, probably three main components there timing, Triceratops and the drilling and the potential for Antelope 7. Timing, I think as I have said before, I want to remind people on the call, every trillion cubic feet that we establish extra 7 Tcf [ph] this was $400 million purely in terms of a cash payment towards this company. Now when you add in the MPV associated with that project and this can be cash flow, you are talking $200 million to $300 million. So you can see every Tcf is worth in the order of $600 million to $700 million. So we are absolutely focused on getting that volume correct, and that is our major priority. So where we have to spend a little more time understanding things, making sure we get our interpretations right or we retrieved the right data and retrieve complete data set and we are going to that. I mean, very simply $700 million per Tcf and it’s a significant value for our shareholders.</p>
<p>Now when you combine that, that doesn’t mean that we are relaxing in any way, shape or form with respect to our schedule and example is the recent drilling performance at Triceratops and the drilling components associated with Antelope-5. We are genuinely pleased by the performance of our drilling team on those wells. And we are seeing a marked improvement and by any measures according to wells down in less than 60 days to Triceratops is a significant achievement. I would like to see a lighter thing that we can continue in that space.</p>
<p>Thirdly, comment and question around Antelope-7. Well, frankly, Evan, we have been surprised on the upsize with respect to these tests. We have seen – David may want to add that we have seen one huge compartment as a result of the Antelope-5 well. Now, we have got – what we have to do is we have to take a look at what that means until the overall appraisal program. First, what we are going to emphasize is that’s good news. So, Antelope-7 will be a joint venture decision. And what we will do is we will just continue to operate the results from Antelope-5 and Antelope-4 and Antelope-6. But David, do you want to give any update on where we are with Antelope-7 in the joint venture?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Kirk</span></strong></p>
<p>You are absolutely correct, Michael. We are looking at the value of information. That’s what drives us on what data we need. So, that’s under active discussion within the joint venture and the joint venture will come to a conclusion on that in the near future I expect. So, we are actively discussing with the joint venture. We are looking to see what can be the value to the joint venture of any additional activities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, [indiscernible]. So, in summary, the segregation process will start at the end of the appraisal program. But as I said before, we thought this behaving like a giant. And a field like this had to be appraised appropriately and that’s $600 million to $700 million per Tcf in terms of value. We absolutely got to get it right. But you combine that with the fact that we are improving our [Technical Difficulty] payment in the middle of next year. Does that help, Evan?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Evan Calio</span></strong></p>
<p>Just one more kind of more on the pragmatics here in terms of rig deployments, so is Antelope – the rig that’s on Antelope-6, is that the rig that you will utilize for Antelope-4? And then somewhat related, if the JV partnership determines that you will drill an Antelope-7 well, is it possible – do you have the rig flexibility to do that simultaneously with an Antelope-4? Just again, it just goes down to the details of a quarter and the timing of the payment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Well, we think the excellent performance of the rig 115, and the previous excellent performance of the rig 103. We are now in almost luxurious position where we have got two rigs, and two rig groups that are performing very well. So, your point is very well taken, because now we have got two rigs that is on the track record drilling on Antelope until what we need to do is we need to take down and just take a look what the event was in with respect to each wells for each rig. So, it will be again the decision, but the JV is now faced with a good conundrum. We have two rigs in country, with two rigs that are performing as very, very well. So, we will take a look at the schedule and we will be starting exactly where we are going to deploy the 103 and the 115.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Evan Calio</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks guys. I will leave it there. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Neil Beveridge from Bernstein. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Beveridge</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks very much guys for the presentation this evening. My first question is just around clarification, Mike, around the delay in certification. Can you confirm if the delay is a result of delay to the drilling program or is this a delay due to the possible addition of additional appraisal activities such as a seventh well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s a mixture of both, but let’s be clear. We are not at this stage saying there is going to be an Antelope-7 well, Antelope-7 wells. And there is no doubt that the issues that we had thus far – had Antelope-4, has caused the delay. But we have been very, very careful to make sure that we gather the maximum amount of data and that when we do the testing, we are not going to shoot [ph] on the testing program or any belonging programs. So the appropriate amount of data as much as we possible can, so we make the right decision at the right time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Beveridge</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. That’s understood. Yes. The second question is really just around the dynamic data you have got from the extended well set, so you talked about the confidence that’s given you in terms of this being a more simple container, you talked about the permeabilities, has this – has the pressure data – the downhole pressure data you have got has that enabled you to narrow the range for the potential resource size?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe I’ll start and I will ask [indiscernible] is named in charge of the development. Let me give some data that we gathered provided its good data is targeted on reducing the range first of all and obviously then get into the accurate number. So we sit with 1,550 analysts now testing data. We are certainly hoping in on a range and a specific figure. But this is all to go yet. And we have only tested on five in this present campaign. We have got our work to continue and at Antelope 6. David you want to give some more detail about we are heading?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Kirk</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s quite a simple answer to your question is absolutely is if we have now the range with significant to reduce the down type and we now I think we understand the minimum volumes that we could be on.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>So that comes back to me, my commentary around, Neil we are confident that we have got enough gas for two train development.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Beveridge</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. And that would be 7 Tcf for the two trains?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>What I will say Neil is we are confident we have got enough gas for a two train development.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Beveridge</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. And just one final quick – yes, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry. I was actually remembering and reading one of your reports and I think you are calling back the fact that you guys think its 7 Tcf, but I would say gas is two trains now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Beveridge</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. Just one final question, just on the forward drilling program, can you just talk about Antelope deep and Raptor appraisal, the second appraisal well, that wasn’t mentioned tonight, but I just want to understand if that’s still on the schedule?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the simple answer is yes. Raptor, once we finish the Triceratops, just an update on Triceratops, we will be logging and we will be doing testing, is that correct, David?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Kirk</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. And that’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>And from there when they will mobilize the rig to Raptor, so the 115 [indiscernible] the Raptor and Antelope signed the JV’s approved location. And final timing, we see is sometime in 2016. That will be a JV decision obviously by Total because it sits within in PRL 15.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Beveridge</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks very much, Mike. Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Neil.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your last question comes from the line of Pavel Molchanov from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Pavel Molchanov</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi guys. Sorry just to kind of pickup on that last one, you mentioned three months ago that Raptor or Raptor appraisal is a 2015 spud date, so has that shifted now into next year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>No, no. I mean maybe I will pass this to David to give some more details. But broadly what I am saying is, now – once we complete testing on Triceratops, we will be moving across to Raptor definitely.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Kirk</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s correct, Michael. We just finished some remedial work on the Raptor site at the moment. And as Michael says the rig 115 is currently in Triceratops will finish the logging and testing and then it will be mobilized to Raptor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Pavel Molchanov</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, got it, okay. I appreciate the clarity on that. And then just kind of taking a step back, obviously we have seen a lot of deterioration in LNG economics in Asia-Pacific. And I think I asked this question three months ago, but they have actually got more since then. Is there any adjustment or modification in how Total is thinking about its LNG portfolio based on the fact that there is kind of a medium-term risk of oversupply now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, first of all, let me answer the question been asked in a way that’s really a question for Total. And what they are thinking in terms of their development on that portfolio, I will address that to them. But what I can tell you is from all communications and all work in the JV, Antelope and PRL 15 sits as a very important strategic project for Total. And rest assured, we are in communications with Total at all levels from Chairman to the highest level of Total down to the guys working in the field and we are seeing them pushing this project and moving forward with great enthusiasm. So, I don’t really see any need or cause for concern in that space.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Pavel Molchanov</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And it’s your internal sense of the prospective project economics as appealing as it was, let’s say, 6 months or 12 months ago?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Hession</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes. And I mean, let’s take an independent view. I mean, we have put out there the Wood Mackenzie slide, I think that was on Slide 10. And as you can see, in terms of Greenfield LNG projects, we started very well. We are possibly the lowest cost or one of the lowest cost LNG projects on the planet. And I think this is moving down our material. This present environment where projects, let’s say, the more modular projects or the more expensive projects are going to explore down and sometimes cancel or sometimes postpone actually could play into the hands of the more cost advantage of these projects, which obviously we all want. I am certainly seeing a greater interest in people wanting to participate in Elk-Antelope and that goes from people wanting to work on it or companies and contractors wanting to participate in everything from seismic through to construction. So, we could be in a really good position, where the services are properly priced. And when the thing is coming on stream, there will be left by these in the next couple of years and therefore less projects coming on stream in the early 2020s and that could place us in a very nice division. Low cost and then be able to capture high prices, because there will be less projects.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Pavel Molchanov</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Now, I appreciate the color on that, obviously, a lot of thoughts these days about the macro commodity landscape. So, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And we have no further questions. Please go ahead, Dr. Hession, for your closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Hession</strong></p>
<p>Well, thank you everybody for joining the call today. This past quarter has been important for Elk-Antelope. The first program continues to encourage us and encourages us that we have enough gas for two LNG giants. Total is now operating PRL 15, tangible evidence of their commitment to the LNG projects at the beginning. With selective size of the LNG project infrastructure, I am now into basis of design. And rest assured we are going to continue to prioritize our investment on proving out the discoveries and the series shareholder value. So, with that, I look forward to catching you next time and thank you for your participation today.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, that does conclude your conference for today. Thank you for your participation and for using AT&amp;T Executive Teleconference. You may now disconnect.</p>
