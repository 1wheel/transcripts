<p>I will now turn the call over to Ms. Jyoti Deshpande, CEO of Eros Plc. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Jyoti Deshpande </strong></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. Thank you for taking the time to attend Eros International Plc’s earnings call for the first quarter ended June 30, 2015. Eros International is a leading global entertainment company that co-produces, acquires and distributes Indian films across diversified distribution channels across 50 different countries and in over 25 different languages worldwide. </p>
<p>Our dominant box office market share consistently each year, along with our significant library ownership of over 3,000 films allows us to be frontrunners in this space as new opportunities present themselves on the back of explosive structural growth in India. </p>
<p>Last year was all about delivering the 20 times growth in the last 10 years by crossing the $100 million EBITDA milestone and laying the foundation for the ErosNow strategy. Our exciting and unique OTT platform that offers endless entertainment to the consumers with movies, music, television shows and originals. </p>
<p>What you will see starting this year is a systematic strategy which will continue for the next five years to firstly scale our film slate from 65 to 70 films currently to over 100 to 120 films across the next three to five years, across Hindi as well as multiple regional languages.</p>
<p>Secondly, we will fast track our execution strategy for ErosNow customer acquisition worldwide through a 360 degree product, content, pricing, distribution and marketing strategy. </p>
<p>Thirdly, we will target new markets such as China, Japan, South Korea, South America, through co-productions and other collaborations, not only to tap into the box office potential and the television licensing market, but also to create consumer demand for a curated version ErosNow by partnering with local synergy partners. </p>
<p>With that background, I am pleased to report a strong set of results for the first quarter ended 30<sup>th</sup> of June 2015. Revenues increased by 10.1% to $50 million, compared to $45.4 million in the prior year period. Currency comparable revenues increased by 14.9%. Adjusted EBITDA increased by a 43.2% to $11.6 million, compared to $8.1 million in the prior year period.</p>
<p>During Q1 FY 2016, we released a total of 16 films, of which, two were high</p>
<p>budget films, both Tamil, namely Mass and Uttama Villain, and three were medium budget including the blockbuster hit Tanu Weds Manu Returns and Dil Dhadakne Do for overseas only and the rest were low budget films. Tanu Weds Manu Returns had an extraordinary run at the box-office and ended up grossing over $40 million worldwide which is reflected in the theatrical skew to the revenues this quarter.</p>
<p>Now let me share some more progress on ErosNow. We did the official marketing launch of ErosNow in mid-July in India with the marketing peg of TV se pehle, which means before TV and premiered Tanu Weds Manu just eight weeks from its theatrical run along with four other premier films. </p>
<p>The 360 degree marketing burst included TV ads, print ads, digital advertising, social media campaigns on Twitter and Facebook et cetera. We are pleased to announce that as of end July, ErosNow has 26.5 million registered users worldwide, which comprises of free transactional and premium users, a 38% growth to the numbers that we previously announced. </p>
<p>Additionally, we announced the production of our four original programs to be aired exclusively on ErosNow later this year. By January 2016, we expect to launch at least one of the original series a month and by 2017, we expect to launch at least two series a month including second seasons of the 2016 originals.</p>
<p>We have announced our disruptive pricing strategy for the premium subscription model, which will be implemented through the next quarter. Our two-tiered premium subscription pricing will offer a user all content on a basic ad free experience for Rs.50 per month which is around $0.80 per month and our second premium tier will offer access to all of the content as well as features such as high definition, portability across devices, offline caching and other features for Rs.100 a month which is around $1.6 a month. </p>
<p>We believe this pricing is geared towards strong customer acquisition in the future. Our distribution strategy for ErosNow continues to be platform-agnostic. We have inked an important deal with Bharti Airtel one of India’s largest telecom operators that has launched 4G in over 286 cities to integrate ErosNow on their 4G platform to combine data and content for a compelling consumer proposition with over 860 million mobile subscribers in India slated to cross 1 billion by 2017 and 25% of them being smartphone users and with 4G launches on the way in over 300 cities. We are excited about the prospects this holds for ErosNow.</p>
<p>Our second quarter has had an extraordinary beginning with the new box office records set by Salman Khan’s BajrangiBhaijaan which has already grossed in the worldwide box office over $78 million and is the only Indian film to have crossed the prestigious $16 million mark in just three days. The film is gearing for a wide release later this year.</p>
<p>Our high budget Telugu release Srimanthudu starring Mahesh Babu, has crossed the Rs. 1 billion or the $ 16 million mark going on to becoming the second highest Telugu grosser this year.</p>
<p>Further releases in Q2 include Welcome Back, Hero, RajiniMurugan and Life of</p>
<p>Josutty This year Q2 is likely to be our biggest quarter driven by timing of the new releases, although library revenues tend to be more back-ended as we get the benefit of full slate from bundling deals. </p>
<p>Q3 is pegged around BajiraoMastani the big magnum opus on Christmas. Other high profile releases in the year includes Singh is Bling for overseas, Sardar, which is again a franchise film 24 Dictator and a slate of other Hindi and regional language films. </p>
<p>We have full visibility for our slate for FY 2016 and FY 2017, since our near-term slate is substantially funded and the original shows pipeline for ErosNow is budgeted. We do not expect investment in content in fiscal 2016 to exceed the $225 million, which is lower than the $267.2 million we spent in fiscal 2015. Unless we opportunistically decide to spend an additional amount on furthering our slate, ErosNow or libraries, we are on track to be free cash flow positive by the end of fiscal 2016.</p>
<p>We are at an inflection point where we can combine our internal strengths of strong balance sheet, library and global distribution network and the ErosNow first mover advantage with the prolific growth in the traditional and emerging distribution platform within India to significantly increase our profitability, as well as shareholder value in the times to come. </p>
<p>With that, let me turn the call over to Prem Parameswaran, our newly appointed Group CFO to address his maiden earnings call and walk you through our financial performance in more detail and we’ll then open the call up to your questions. Thank you. </p>
<p><strong>Prem Parameswaran</strong></p>
<p>Terrific, thank you, Jyoti. Good morning, everyone and thanks for joining us today. We are off to a strong start as Jyoti pointed out in fiscal year 2016 with solid year-over-year growth in our first quarter. </p>
<p>Revenues for the three months ended June 30th increased by 10.1% year-over-year to $50 million. Taking into account the effects of foreign exchange, our constant currency comparable revenue for the first quarter actually was 14.9% increase. I should note that the average rate of exchange used to convert Indian Rupees to U.S. dollars was Indian Rupees 63.4 to 1 US dollar.</p>
<p>The increase in revenue in the quarter was driven primarily by the mix of our film slate released during the quarter, along with strong contributions from our valuable catalogue of films. In the first quarter, we released 16 films, two of which were high budget films, three were medium and the remaining were low. </p>
<p>Looking at profitability, EBITDA increased an impressive 43.2% to $11.6 million, that’s compared to $8.1 million in the year prior. The increase in adjusted EBITDA is primarily attributable to the successful execution of investing in high-quality Hindi and regional language films that we distribute globally and monetize across traditional and emerging distribution platforms. </p>
<p>As Jyoti mentioned, during the first quarter, we released Tanu Weds Manu Returns, which was a global box office success for us. This release was the first film of the year to gross Rs1 billion crore $16 million at the Indian box office in only 11 days ending with over $40 million in worldwide growth, a testament to the strength and popularity of our growing film slate. </p>
<p>Due to these strong film results, the aggregate revenue from our theatrical stream increased from $19.1 million in June – the last quarter to $33.7 million in June 2016. </p>
<p>At this point, I would like to draw your attention to the note regarding the use of non-GAAP measures and their uses and limitations contained within our earnings release. As you know the Company’s primary revenue streams are derived from three channels; theatrical, television syndication and digital and ancillary. For the three months ended June 30, aggregate revenues from theatrical, television syndication and digital were at $33.7 million, $10 million and $6.3 million respectively. </p>
<p>The mix of the revenues were approximately 6% of the revenues were attributable to India, 34% were attributed to the rest of the world. Given the continued success of ErosNow, growing registered users over 89% from 14 million registered users in February 2015 to over 26.5 million today, we expect the shift in revenue mix over time.</p>
<p>Even though the revenues increased, we are also able to decrease the cost of sales by 0.8%, to $33 million in the first quarter, compared to $33.2 million in the year ago period. This marginal decrease of approximately 1% was related to a $2.3 million decrease in direct costs due to the mix of films as the two high budget films; two high budget Tamil films had relatively low and print advertising cost. And Tanu Weds Manu Returns was a medium budget film with lower direct cost than a high budget Hindi film. </p>
<p>This reduction was modestly offset by an increase in amortization cost reflecting the company’s new release slate, as well as additions made to the film catalogue and prior released content. </p>
<p>Gross profit increased $5 million to $17.1 million in the quarter primarily due to increased revenues in proportion to the cost generated by the new release slate, as well as the timing of contribution of revenue from catalogue sales. As a percentage of revenues, our gross margin was 34.1% in the first quarter, compared to 26.8% in the year ago period. </p>
<p>These strong results with net income increasing by $6.4 million or 246.2% have largely led to the increase in adjusted EBITDA of $11.6 million. But I’d draw your attention to the non-GAAP financial measures as the corresponding notes contained in our earnings release for this figure. </p>
<p>Turning to the balance sheet, net debt at June 30, 2015 totaled $320.9 million with cash and cash equivalents totaling $155.6 million. Since our near-term slate is substantially funded and the original programming pipeline for ErosNow is budgeted, we do not expect investment in content in the fiscal 2016 to exceed $225 million, which is lower than the $267.2 million we spent in fiscal 2015. </p>
<p>Unless, we opportunistically decide to spend an additional amount on furthering our slate, ErosNow or libraries, we are on track to be free cash flow positive by the end of fiscal 2016. </p>
<p>Overall, the business is off to a strong start to the fiscal year and we are excited with the opportunities that lay ahead for our business. We have an impressive slate of films on top for this coming year and the recent official launch of the ErosNow gives us great confidence in the strength of the business going forward.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll turn it back to Jyoti for final comments and open it up. </p>
<p><strong>Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>Let’s take some questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session </strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Now we have an opening question from John Janedis of Jefferies. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Janedis</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Jyoti, the $26.5 million ErosNow service, I think puts you well on your way to your targets and so, from a subscriber acquisitions perspective, or cost perspective, has it increased over the last quarter compared to a couple of quarters ago and has the acceleration of the subs allow you to attempt to monetize the sub sooner? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>Yes, so I think it’s a combination of factors. So if you see, we sort of gave the update probably three months ago, during the last results, as of that date and now we are giving you as of July. So we’ve had the benefit of couple of weeks of post-marketing to see what the trend is and we can see a pronounced difference post-marketing as well. So, we think we have tailwinds behind us, momentum behind us to get the user base to a very large number and then now, we are going to implement the new pricing which is the much lower pricing than what the rate card is right now. So we think, the pricing will be attractive once we launch it out over the next quarter for people to come in at Tier-1 basic and Tier-2 basic, so we should – it should encourage people to sign up to premium subscription as well. So we’ll have to monitor the progress across the next three to four portals, but we are doing all the things. We are doing all the right things. We are getting all the right content. We are pricing it right. We are marketing it. We haven’t yet started marketing it internationally. That will start this quarter. So, slowly, we are platforming the marketing in India as well as internationally and we hope to reap the rewards in the coming years. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Janedis</strong></p>
<p>Okay, and maybe, a similar related, can you give us a little more color on the original programming? The slate in 2017 sounds aggressive and I was wondering how that affects your programming? And then, can you help us with what it means in terms of – maybe either episodes or hours of originals and will you actually own that content?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>Yes, content ownership is at the heart of our strategy. That is what differentiates us from any other player out there, whether Indian or international. So, all of the content that we create including originals will be owned by us and so, we have a cricket-based show. We have a women-based show which is edgy, and it’s a thriller. So we have different zonals of programs that we’ve greenlit, one is an international format that is licensed for India and we are going to remake it in India with popular movie stars. So we’ve mixed it up a little bit. We are targeting the youth of course, average age of Indian being under 29. So these are young edgy shows and very different towards the programs on TV currently are, which are mainly targeting the housewives. And in terms of cost, unlike probably what our international peers have to spend on making high quality series, we could make 13 episodes season one for $2 million to $2.5 million. So, investing in 12 shows a year would be $20 million or $25 million. So, it’s not a lot and we are going to make that investment for sure and we will scale it up in the years to come. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Janedis</strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much. </p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Eric Katz of Wells Fargo. Please go ahead. Your line is open. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Katz</strong></p>
<p>Hi, thank you. What are your thoughts on conversion rates to monthly paying subs in India with the new pricing strategy? Why did you pick those rates? And what month do you expect the new pricing to start? I am just curious if this disrupts the marketing campaign at all since it’s all happening after the campaign?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>The marketing campaign was all about the content; it was not about the pricing at all. So, the marketing campaign was basically saying, here is a disruptive strategy where you are getting content TV Se Pehle, or before TV, so the marketing peg of the content was, here is a one-stop shop that provides you with endless entertainment and latest movies before TV. So that is what we want to encourage registered users and not really highlight the pricing right now. So we want more and more people. Tanu Weds Manu was available free, so it’s not like we blocked it. So anyone who came in and signed up could see Tanu Weds Manu free. But the idea in terms of the long-term is that the current pricing was around Rs.299 which was four times, five times what we are contemplating. And if you compare it to television, so if you look at other forms of entertainment, you get a bouquet of basic channels on cables, of course, with that, but you’ll get 200 channels for that similar price of Rs.300 or $6 or $7, you will get 300 channels. So we decided that OTT platform, we should price it attractive, such that people don’t think twice about spending it and then you will increase ARPU over time by adding new content verticals. You’ll add kids, you’ll have international, you’ll add lifestyle. So you’ll add different zoners of content and increase the ARPU overtime. But right now, what we want to try and do is, convert a large percentage of the user base very quickly to premium subscription. Of course, all of the things are not under our control alone, 4G growth has to happen, broadband growth has to happen. So the user experience is not just a function of all the cool things that we do. It’s also a function of broadband and bandwidth. So, we think, the two will converge in the next couple of years and premium subscriptions should take off at a decent momentum in the next couple of years. Meanwhile, we’ve kept it attractive to grab the low hanging fruit at least.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Katz</strong></p>
<p>And I think the music piece of your business is underappreciated. Can you talk about your position here versus others in this space? How much role music plays? And was that something that was instrumental in your marketing campaign as well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>So, basically what – so music is something that there are other apps that also offer music. So, I think the combined power of being a one-stop-shop that offers movies, and lots of them exclusively are music, our content exclusively and some of the others that we aggregate and including South Indian labels which is a differentiator and TV originals, TV catch-up shows, since we only have linear TV in India and there is no way to catch-up all those shows again, having those shows on ErosNow 48 hours after they are shown on TV is quite compelling and people can watch them without ads and then the originals. So, I think it’s a combined proposition. Yes, music, we have hundreds and thousands of tracks and music videos available which is very, very popular, especially for the mobile subscriber user where short form content is quite compelling as well. So, they come in when music is played exclusively and then they also watch other stuffs and convert to becoming a registered user.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Katz</strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you. </p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Tim Nolan with Macquarie. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim Nolan </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. I don’t look at your Eros India Media Limited, India subsidiary, all that closely, but I noticed that they had some different growth figures, at least for revenue, I believe that high EBITDA, one of you could just – just curious what the differences are between that and Eros PLC? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>So, basically, there was a one-off transfer of the digital rights from India to our international structure for PLC which was an inter-company, which in consolidation gets knocked off. So the Indian revenue growth, if you look at that, if you look at without that transaction, was around 37% growth and not really 96% growth as it’s apparent on the face of it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim Nolan </strong></p>
<p>Okay. Testing to those things as though, could you address please the potential in terms of NetFlix to India and how you see that panning out? And then, secondly, and separately or thirdly I guess and separately, I see, you are flowing most of the growth as Techzone transaction. That’s been a long time, I mean, just curious why that took so long to actually to close? And then I think I understand, but if you could just walk through what the advantages of that are for the ErosNow platform please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>Perfect. So, sure, NetFlix is welcome to come to India, probably it will help market the category and increase the consumption through OTT platform. NetFlix is likely to come in with just a original content, because, the English movies are already scattered and fragmented to other players already like the existing television players and alike. So, English content in terms of a box office benchmark for you contributes about 8% to 11% of the total Indian box office. So, it’s an attractive niche market for high quality franchise films at the moment. If NetFlix wants to offer Indian content and really attract the mass market, then probably they will get talking with players like us to see if there are any synergies. That’s how we see their strategy playing out. In terms of the other question that you asked about Techzone and the synergies, of course, the deal took a long time to conclude, because it involved considerations in shares and FIPB approval because they are a foreign company. So regulatory approvals was what took this long. So, it’s a procedural, but it’s integrated as a 100% subsidiary of ErosNow and we are actively marketing. So Techzone has over 40 million to 50 million transactions going to it’s back-end every month through its billing integration with all the major telcos in India. So we are leveraging the telco relationships. We are cross-marketing our ErosNow platform to those subscribers that Techzone has and trying to convert some of them each month to monthly registered users of ErosNow. So, we see synergies. We are building in that purchasing capability using the Techzone billing integration and so on and so forth. So, it’s definitely a complementary to our ErosNow strategy. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim Nolan </strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Bryan Goldberg of Bank of America. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Goldberg</strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks. So I’ve got a couple. First on ErosNow. Aside from the premium subscription offerings, ad sales seems also like a meaningful part of the opportunity. Can you just update us where the company stands with respect to assembling the manpower either internally or working with external firms to go out and take advantage of the advertising opportunity? And then, what needs to happen to drive real advertiser buy-in at the platform and what metrics do they need to see to really – for us to really see the floodgates open up here? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, in terms of recruitment, we’ve got a team on board and our Head of Revenue is a gentleman who used to work with Star TV which is the number one TV channel in terms of ad sales. So, he comes from that background and has deep relationships with all the brands and he is building a bigger team around him. His name is Zulfiqar. So, the team is in place and for the launch, we partnered with Mindshare who is the biggest media agency for ad sales in India. And in fact, during the launch, all of our merchandizing and posters and campaign was displayed all across the Mindshare offices and to encourage their sales people to sell and things like that. So, we got brands on board. For the launch, we had a brand partner called Videocon who came in and sponsored our Tanu Weds Manu launch. But we think that this can be an exciting opportunity. Goldman Sachs says in the next ten years, it will be a $2 billion plus kind of an opportunity which is not insignificant given that television advertising currently is just over $2 billion. So, we are excited. What we think we need to do to convert ad revenues a bit more is, we’ve just only switched on the ad ability, we have switched it off until now. We’ve only just switched it on, but we need to invest more time in data analytics and share some more data with advertisers which are unwilling to do just yet, just like all of you are curious for data and we aren’t sharing anything beyond Tier-1 data. So we are going to give it another six months of build and then we will have ad decks and we will start monetizing on a serious nature. Right now, we are taking brands on board who don’t want too much data, but who just want the association. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Goldberg</strong></p>
<p>Okay, that’s very helpful. And then, I guess, I’ve got – sort of a derivative question on ErosNow. With the scaling of the platform now and increased content availability, how was the rollout of the service impacted the dialogue that you are having with the traditional syndication buyers of your film content? I mean, is it helping you with pricing power or is it making discussions a little more contentious? Is it tougher to get the rate increases or no change at all? Just kind of curious what’s going on there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>So, right now, they are sitting up and taking notice. We definitely have their attention. But we did manage to secure a deal for Tanu Weds Manu and the other films that we bundled with it including four or five other premiers after the ErosNow carve out. So, in terms of experience, it has not impacted us at all so far. But we will see. As we grow, there maybe a little bit of pushback in terms of licensing deals, television licensing deals, et cetera. But because we own the content and we sort of control the windowing, we think that, even if there is an impact, it will not be minuscule. It will be more than compensated by the new revenues and new value creation from ErosNow. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Goldberg</strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. And then I guess, it’s more of a housekeeping question about some comments you made about the future films slate as you ramp towards 100 to 120 films per year and I apologize if you addressed this in your prepared remarks. But can you help bridge us – at least conceptually from the current 60 to 70 film slate size, I mean, will the incremental films be about mix is sort of what your slate looks like today, high and low budget or how many are going to come from Trinity Pictures or your Chinese co-production deal or any kind of color there you could provide would be helpful?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>So, basically, right now, we just tell you 60 films - 65 films a year and about eight films are high budget and 15 to 20 films are medium budget and the balance are low budget, right? So, we are only dividing up the films on budget. And actually, if you look across the slate, the growth will come from the regional slate. So, you will – if you are doing 120 films, you may still end up doing 30 films in Hindi across high, medium and low and you may still do only eight films which are Hindi, which are high budget or it may even be six, but, you will do ten films in Tamil, ten films in Telegu, ten films in Kannada, Malayalam and so on and so forth and a Malayalam high budget film is actually $1 million, a Tamil high budget film, it can be $8 million. So that differentiation and revenue model is what we will have to help you build which we will as this strategy pans out a little bit more. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Goldberg</strong></p>
<p>And then I guess, - thank you, and then finally, just your ability to go out and source all this incremental film content, quality film content, I am just curious are there – what are the most significant challenges in your ability to actually scale to this size? I mean, is there enough decent output out there? Or how should we think about that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>So, we can see that the power of our brand has already percolated across all the regional space. So, we are confidently saying this because, as we speak, we have three Bengali greenlits, about six to seven Malayalam greenlits, couple of Marathi greenlit. So Telegu and Tamil, we’ve always been strong anyway. So it’s just a question of taking that to the next level. So, we’ve been working on this for the last couple of years already and we are already at that point where we see visibility in our ability to scale this quite successfully. We’ve given ourselves three to five years. But it’s a question of how much we want to spend, if we want to do it earlier, we are in a position to do so. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Goldberg</strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you very much. </p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Justin [Indiscernible]. Please go ahead. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Hi guys. Thank you. Just, two quick questions, if I may. First one, have you guys thought regarding the new pricing strategy for the subscription models, have you guys done any market research or surveys or anything to consumers over there in India as to who might be willing, accept to paying this price in terms of percentages or any kind of feedback you have? And second question is regarding, I haven’t taken a look at your recent the balance sheet with this release, but where do you guys stand in terms of funding? Obviously, you are going to need to spend a lot more money on ErosNow going forward. What are your plans in that capacity? Thank you. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for that question. So number one, we had the benefit of keeping in soft launch for over 18 months where we grew our registered user base to a fairly large number. So we used that user base as a research base to collect data, find out price points, because it already had a $4.5 price point attached to it. So the premium service was available, but we didn’t convert a lot of people at $4.5 price point. So we used our large user base to learn more. What are they comparing it to and what are the price points that will excite them and for what features are they willing to pay more. We also access other third-party researches, general consumer researches on what price points in which socioeconomic and demographic groups, what do they spend on, how much do they spend on. They may not be related products, they may – because there aren’t similar – too many similar services available. So you have – do have to rely on comparing little bit of apples and oranges. So, based on that, over a two-year period study, we’ve come out with this pricing. </p>

<p>And just to add on your balance sheet question, we are actually lowering our CapEx this year to $225 million from $267.2 million which we talked about. So, we are actually spending less. So, hopefully that gives you comfort.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>And we are well capitalized. If we needed to spend more, we wouldn’t have to raise more capital necessarily. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you very much guys. </p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. At this time, there are no further questions. I will now turn the call to Jyoti Deshpande for any additional or closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>Well, thanks again for asking all these questions, being interested in our company. It’s showing in the growth in the share price as well. So, we want your continued support. We will want to concentrate on our strategy and execution and we will continue to try and give you more and more information, especially about ErosNow as we also learn more about the service. So, thank you again and speak to you in three months time. </p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you for participating in the Eros International fourth quarter and full year 2015 earnings conference call. You may now disconnect.</p>
<p><strong>Jyoti Deshpande</strong></p>
<p>First quarter ended June 30, not fourth quarter and full year.</p>
