With me on the call today are Darren Richardson, Mad Catz's President and Chief Executive Officer; and Karen McGinnis, Mad Catz's Chief Financial Officer. Darren will provide an overview of the results and the principal drivers behind them. Afterwards, Karen will review the financial results in greater detail, before we turn the call back to Darren for some closing remarks.</p>
<p>Before we begin, however, let me just take a few minutes to read the Safe Harbor language in today's discussion that will contain forward-looking statements about the company's financial results, estimates, and business prospects that involve substantial risks and uncertainties.

<p>With that, I would now like to introduce Darren Richardson, President and Chief Executive Officer of Mad Catz. Please go ahead, Darren.</p>
<p><strong>Darren Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Norberto, and good afternoon, everyone. We appreciate you joining us on the call today to review our fiscal 2016 first quarter financial results. </p>
<p>The overall market environment for Mad Catz remains challenging in the first quarter of fiscal 2016 largely the result of two broad trends. First, consumers were largely focused on products for the next gen consoles as evidenced by our 83% sales growth for next gen products. At the same time, demand for legacy platform products fell sharply more than offsetting that growth. Positively, we have very limited inventories of legacy platform products and minimal future exposure. Our initiatives are centered around the extensive and still expanding next generation console installed base that now includes over 25 million play station for consoles and more than 11 million Xbox One consoles.</p>
<p>Second, demand in Europe has been very weak and as a result, competitors continue to be very promotional in an effort to drive sales and create inventories. Fortunately, we limited our inventory exposure to the legacy consoles over the past two years. We are very excited about our partnership with Harmonix to launch Rock Band 4 in October. Harmonix is the most successful music and developer of all time having developed Guitar Hero I and Guitar Hero II before kicking off the Rock Band franchise. The Rock Band games are some of the most critically-acclaimed games of all time and have sold tens of millions of units. Rock Band 3 was a significant contributor to Mad Catz financial success in fiscal 2011 and we believe Rock Band 4 has the potential to be much more successful. And I would like to take a few minutes to explain why. </p>
<p>We are now at the start of the next-generation console cycle, which gives us a nice runway into a rapidly expanding installed base. For Rock Band 3, the keyboard was the new instrument and our sales were predominately the keyboard and keyboard bundles while EA sold the standalone game. This time around Mad Catz is the co-publisher and we will be selling the entire product line including the core brand instruments, guitars, drums and microphones, as well as guitar bundles, Band-in-a-Box bundles and the standalone game. Last week, we showcased a new and groundbreaking gameplay in Rock Band 4 at Gamescom in Germany.</p>
<p>Guitarists can now express themselves like never before, leaving their own mark on their favorite tracks with the new Freestyle Guitar Solo gameplay. No music lessons or expertise required. Freestyle Guitar Solos allow players of any skill level to string together truly original solos. And the response to the new gameplay at Gamescom just like E3 in June was overwhelmingly positive. We are seeing great critical reviews, strong consumer preorders, very positive initial orders from retailers, we have factor production fully ramped up, we expect shipments to retailers to begin at September and in fiscal 2016 we expect sales of Rock Brand 4 products to contribute to significant sales growth, improved operating leverage and increased cash flow.</p>
<p>Our focus and our goal is to bring to market compelling products for passionate gamers on a global basis. We believe that Mad Catz can succeed if we build on our strength to pursue targeted segments within the games industry and leverage our strong and deep distribution footprint to deliver products with the right design and features that are essential to the passionate gamer’s experience.</p>
<p>With that, I would like to turn the call over to Karen to provide some additional color on the results. Karen?</p>
<p><strong>Karen McGinnis</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Darren. I'll begin my comments with a review of the income statement. Net sales for the first quarter were $13 million, which represents a 23% decline from the first quarter last year. The overall decrease in net sales is driven primarily by a decrease in sales of audio products related to legacy consoles as well as a decline in sales of our universal audio products. </p>
<p>While we are experiencing strong acceptance and continued growth in sales of products developed for the new consoles which represented 28% of our sales in the first quarter, these sales only partially offset the decline in sales of products related to legacy consoles, which has had a more pronounced decline than anticipated and is also affecting sales of our universal audio products. </p>
<p>The universal audio product category include products that worked universally on the legacy consoles as well as new products that work universally on the new consoles. As a result, sales of products designed for legacy consoles represented only 2% of sales in the quarter compared to 7% in the first quarter last year and sales of our universal products declined to 15% of first quarter sales from 25% of first quarter sales last year.</p>
<p>Outside of console gaming products, sales of products designed for the PC and Mac which represented 45% of our first quarter sales were down compared to the prior year despite continued strong sales of our Saitek flight simulation products. Sales of Saitek products represented 24% of our first quarter sales, compared to 18% in the same period last year. </p>
<p>We are excited about the growth opportunities for Saitek brands, including the recently announced agreements with Cloud Imperium Games to create dedicated gaming hardware for the immensely popular Star Citizen Space Stimulation game.</p>
<p>The decline in sales of products designed for the PC and Mac was due to a reduction in sales of gaming mice and keyboard. As we continue to face aggressive pricing by some of our competitors, particularly in Europe. We are launching a refresh of our R.A.T. gaming mice this year starting with the R.A.T. PROX, which is available for pre-order now.</p>
<p>We believe this refresh of the R.A.T. line will help to once again drive growth in this category. As expected, we experienced a decline in sales of products for smart devices, which represented 10% of our first quarter sales compared to 8% last year, driven primarily by gaming controllers sold to our customers in the Asia-Pacific region under a private label program last year. </p>
<p>However, these declines were offset partially by growth in sales of our Mad Catz branded controllers, particularly our control R and Control I. Momentum continues around mobile gaming and we remain very excited about the growth potential of our expansive game smart line of products, which has been developed specifically for gaming on mobile and smart devices.</p>
<p>Looking at the results by geography, first quarter net sales in EMEA declined 33% to $5.6 million and represents 44% of total net sales in the quarter, compared to 50% a year ago. First quarter net sales in the Americas declined 9% to $5 million and represented 38% of total net sales in the first quarter, compared to 33% a year ago.</p>
<p>First quarter net sales in Asia Pacific declined 19% to $2.4 million and represents 18% of total net sales in the first quarter compared to 17% a year ago. Overall, the strengthening of the US dollar against the currencies of our foreign operations had a negative impact on sales growth and sales in local currencies are converted to fewer US dollars than they were a year ago.</p>
<p>Excluding the effects of changes in foreign currency rate, our net sales for the first quarter would have declined 17% rather than 23% compared to the prior year. As a result of the decrease in overall net sales and the decline in gross margin from 30.2% to 22.2% gross profit for the first quarter decreased 43% from the prior year first quarter. The decrease in gross margin over the prior year period was due primarily to an increase in royalties and licenses as a percentage of net sales based on our product mix and fixed distribution cost. These decreases in gross margin were offset partially by lower product returns. </p>
<p>Going forward, we expect gross margin to decrease in fiscal 2016 compared to fiscal 2015 as sales of Rock Band 4 products are expected to have a lower gross margin in many of our other products. Total operating expenses in the first quarter were $6.6 million, up 7% from the first quarter last year. The increase in operating expenses was driven by increases in marketing expenses, particularly trade shows and an increase in research and development expenses, due primarily to a reimbursement we received in the first quarter last year for engineering work performed on behalf of a third party. </p>
<p>These increases were offset partially by decreases in general and administrative expenses. Although we are investing in marketing efforts and ongoing development in new products we continue our efforts to tightly manage discretionary spending. As stated previously, we expect operating expenses in fiscal 2016 on an absolute dollar basis to be higher than fiscal 2015. </p>
<p>However, we expect Rock Band 4 to drive a strong increase in net sales and a decline in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales. For the first quarter of fiscal 2016, our operating loss was $3.8 million compared to $1.1 million last year.</p>
<p>Other income and expense which primarily represents interest expense that are outstanding debt, foreign currency exchange gain and losses, and changes in the fair value of our warrant liabilities generate expense of $230,000 in the first quarter this year, compared to expense of $131,000 in the first quarter last year. This increase in expense was driven primarily by higher interest expense compared to the prior, due primarily to an acceleration in the amortization of fees associated with the replacement of our Wells Fargo Credit Facility.</p>
<p>The income tax benefit of $27,000 for the first quarter of this year and $170,000 for the first quarter last year reflects effective income tax rates of approximately 1%. Our effective income tax rate fluctuates, depending on which jurisdictions generate taxable income or losses.</p>
<p>For entities that generate taxable losses, we may not always be able to record a tax benefit for those losses, if we cannot reasonably predict the ability to use the loss carry forwards in the future. As a result, our effective tax rate can fluctuate greatly. Overall, we generated net loss in the first quarter of $4 million or $0.05 per share, compared to a net loss of $1.2 million or $0.02 per share in the first quarter last year. </p>
<p>Moving on to our cash flow statement and balance sheet, net cash used by operating activities was $2.4 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2016 compared to $600,000 in the first quarter last year. The use of cash this quarter primarily reflects the net loss for the period before non-cash items; and an increase in inventory of $2.1 million, as we start to build inventory to meet forecasted demand. These decreases in operating cash flow were offset partially by $1.8 million decrease in accounts receivable, resulting primarily from the decrease in net sales, and an increase in payables of $1.1 million due primarily to the timing of payments. </p>
<p>Our DSOs were 71 days this quarter compared to 63 days in the first quarter a year ago. And our inventory turns on a trailing-four quarter basis were 3.4 times this quarter compared to 3 times in the first quarter a year ago.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2015, we had a cash balance of $2.1 million and borrowings under our credit facilities of $7.8 million. As a result, we ended the quarter with a net position of bank loan less cash of $5.8 million, compared to $5.3 million a year ago, and $2.8 million last quarter.</p>
<p>As we announced in early July we replaced our $25 million Wells Fargo credit facility with two new facilities that provide combined financing based on eligible accounts receivable and inventory of up to $30 million. The facilities also allow for an increase in capacity to $45 million from September 1, 2015 through September 31, 2015.</p>
<p>We are excited by the growth opportunities ahead of us in fiscal 2016, including the launch of Rock Band 4 this holiday season and we believe these new facilities will provide the financial capacity and flexibility we need to support that growth. We are pleased to be working with both New Star and FGI during these exciting times and look forward to building long term relationships with these lenders.</p>
<p>With that, I'd like to turn the call back to Darren, to provide you with our fiscal 2016 strategic and operational objectives, as well as closing remarks, after which we'll open the call for questions. Darren?</p>
<p><strong>Darren Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Karen. Looking forward to the second quarter of fiscal 2016 we are seeing continuing weakness in our European sales and tough sales comp due to prior year product launches. However, there is a strong stride of new games launching in the back half of the year that we believe will result in this year being more back loaded than usual.</p>
<p>We expect our sales in the second quarter to be particularly strong due to the initial shipments of Rock Band 4. We are very optimistic about our prospects of fiscal 2016. The early reaction to Rock Band 4 has been extremely positively and we expect Rock Band to drive significant sales and modest incremental costs.</p>
<p>Our console business is rebounding on the back of strong next gen sales. We continue to add key PC and Mac products to drive growth in this segment. We are seeing early signs of traction in our game smart products to smart devices and more importantly key new mobile titles are launching with controller support for the first time, and we remain focused on working capital management and OpEx management. </p>
<p>Although the past couple of years have been tough, we’re pleased with our ability to drive operational improvements while still investing in new product development to capitalize on growth opportunities from the ongoing console transition, as well as the shift towards mobile gaming.</p>
<p>We believe fiscal 2016 will be an exciting year for Mad Catz, particularly as we work with Harmonix to launch Rock Band 4 this holiday season. Before we move to Q&amp;A, I wanted to first take a moment to thank our talented and dedicated team at Mad Catz. We've faced some tough environmental challenges over the past two years, but the team continues to execute our key initiatives and drive us forward. </p>
<p>I'll now turn the call back to the operator, so we can answer any questions. Operator?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Thank you. Our first question is from Dave King with ROTH Capital Partners. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dave King</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Good afternoon, Darren and Karen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Karen McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Dave.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Dave.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dave King</span></strong></p>
<p>So I guess first off, in terms of Rock Band 4, I understand you have co-publishing rights this time. So you might have better access to information than you did last time around. But in terms of the initial preorders from consumers and then purchase orders that you’re getting from you guys are both that are seeing from the retailers, is there a way to think about that in terms of how strong the interest has been initially versus Rock Band 3 or versus prior versions, whether that’s from your conversations of the Harmonix et cetera. Just to get a sense, is that orders of magnitude stronger, is that higher percentage is stronger I guess just how are you feeling about the initial traction obviously realizing that we are still early and we’ll know more in September, October et cetera.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thanks. I think in terms of preorders, our feedback from retailers is we’re trending at the higher end of preorders of most title launching this holiday and holding our own against other AAA titles that are launching for holiday. So that’s a very, very positive early stage sign. In terms of retail sell in, retail sell in commitments and even purchase orders in hand at this stage are trending higher than we saw on Rock Band 3. And so we see that as a very, very positive sign as well. Obviously, the key factor is going to be what the actual retail sell through is going to be. </p>
<p>We’ve got a very strong production build, we have inventory in hand and a significant amount of inventory in transit, so we’re going to be set for launch in terms of hardware. Obviously the software needs to be finished up and then we need to get over first part of the approvals on that before we are in a position to ship. So a couple of hurdles to get over, but we are not anticipating anything meaningful on that front and so we feel very, very strong about the launch. </p>
<p>One of the things with Rock Band 4 is it’s envisage to be the Rock Band game for this generation of consoles. So in terms of inventory flow, we are not planning to loading excessive amounts of inventory with a view to blowing it out post holiday. So we want to make sure we’ve got a good solid flow through the holiday and then from holiday to be able to have a three or four year business that actually flows on from Rock Band 4. So right now, we feel very, very pleased about where we are at.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dave King</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That’s great, great color and I can hold my thoughts on that to offline. Again switching gears in terms of the universal business now at 15% of sales, Karen in your comments I think you talked about obviously and me understanding the portion of that legacy versus next gen. I guess for either of you, what’s the good way to think about how that breaks out between universal products that are for legacy consoles versus next gen consoles and I’m just trying to get a sense of when we would start to see maybe the pressure there on the legacy stuff.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It’s kind of difficult to get a cut off there because some universal products were basically run from PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One plus PC. So you have a little bit of a scoop going-on on what’s happening on universal, but there is no question the fall off ties to the lack of having consumers the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 demand. Our positive degree on that, we are pretty much out of all of the inventory that are specifically to Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3, and we’ve been winding that down for really the last two years. So we’ve been very handsome out and being prepared to give up sales to avoid having to do inventory markdowns and price protection at retail and all that. So I think we’re probably ahead of the pack and ahead of competitors in terms of being proactive on that. And so as a result, you see that play out in the sales line where our top line sales are down but at the same time we are not shifting legacy product at zero or negative margins and driving down gross margins further.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dave King</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, fantastic. And then maybe along lines of gross margins in terms of thinking about what drove the margin decline this quarter, it sounds like there was fixed distribution cost also higher royalties paid and then Karen I think you talked about the outlook, obviously Rock Band is going to way just sort of mix perspective, how should we be thinking about some of those other things if you take Rock Band out, I would assume then the fixed distribution cost would continue but also how we should be thinking about the royalties and is there anything else to be thinking about in terms of offsets to Rock Band et cetera.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Karen McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>No, those are the main drivers. It is positive news as that we are actually seeing a decrease in returns as a percentage of sales and so that’s a positive impact. Our fixed distribution costs won’t change materially. We have like Darren said a little bit of incremental cost from Rock Band 4 but not a substantial amount of cost. And so you’ve got that fixed distribution expense that would be much higher sales rate as a percentage that will be on pretty substantially. On the royalties, it’s really the next gen console. </p>
<p>So anything that has a royalty attached to it, so whether it’s fightpad [ph] or fightsticks, it’s our product mix that’s causing the royalties and the percentage to be higher where our PC product particularly the Mice and keyboards which has been declining a little bit don’t have as many royalties attached to them. So as we get some growth back in that category, that will have a positive impact on that product mix for royalties. Our goal outside of Rock Band is to get closer to that 30% gross margin and then the Rock Band 4 will certainly have a downgrade effect to that because it will be a much lower gross margin than that. Does that line help? I know it’s pretty general, but…</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dave King</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s great. I have some others. I’ll hold those for offline. Thanks for all the color and good luck into as we had in the holiday.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Karen McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Dave.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question is from Ed Woo with Ascendiant Capital. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ed Woo</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my question. I just had a little bit of housekeeping. You mentioned product for Rock Band 4 will be shipping in September but again it looks like it’s being released in October. How would you account for that and what do we expect I guess for revenue balancing for next couple of quarters?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>The bulk of the revenue is going to come in the third quarter. However, to be [indiscernible] early October launch day, you need to be shipping a couple of weeks out. So shipments will begin in that last couple of weeks of September. The rate of those shipments is really going to depend on how we go in terms of bundling rates which is all happening here in the U.S. and also in Europe and then secondly, when retailers want that flow coming in. So obviously for East Coast distribution centers that product needs to be hitting the road early to be able to do that eight or 10 day transit time plus get through retailers distribution centers for West Coast and for retailers that have fairly rapid store replenishment that doesn’t have to happen little bit later.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ed Woo</span></strong></p>
<p>Great.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Karen McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>We will definitely have revenue in September. We are anticipating that. And also when you get to that last week in September, it will depend on the customer as well because it will depend on our shipping terms with that customer sort of revenue recognition to similar FOB shipping point which means we recognize revenue when we ship the product and that will be FOB destination which means we recognize revenue once they received it, and so that might have a little bit of play and timing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ed Woo</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. I know there has been a little bit of volatility with the Chinese currency and I know last year some people had quality issues coming out of China. Do you see anything that may possibly present an issue over the next – heading to the holidays?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, we are not anticipating any and a lot of those core issues were in the U.S. but we are not anticipating that this year but again that’s not something we control. So, we were hoping as strongly as we possibly can that there will be no issues this year, but obviously if that happens that is going to be a challenge, but again we do have a lot of inventory in transit and inventory in hand as we speak today, but we are depended on the bulk of the inventory arriving over the next six weeks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ed Woo</span></strong></p>
<p>Great and then going back to Karen, you mentioned that operating expenses on absolute basis will go up as a percentage of revenue should go down, how much of the cost of launching Rock Band are you responsible for and do we imply that, you know you are spending on your other products will also be going down as a percentage?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Karen McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, when you look at a pure dollar perspective they are going to go up a little bit and they are going to go up a little bit for a variety of reasons, but the biggest significant one, which isn’t that significant will be that we will be doing some additional marketing this year, not just Rock Band 4, but even for existing product lines. So we are participating in all the trade shows, we went to E3 and went to Gamescom, we went to Tokyo Game show, we were at ChinaJoy and so we’re investing in that market effort and in our internal marketing and sales efforts. As far as Rock Band 4 goes a lot of the marketing though is being paid by Harmonic and then we are working with the retailers through our normal profit of advertising programs, to also sign marketing at a retail level, but that is not as much out of pocket expense for Mad Catz.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>And I think the other key in terms of that fixed cost, this quarter was very low sales quarter and not the lowest we've ever had, but one of the lowest we've ever had. And that is really because we have almost no legacy console sales. As we hit the third quarter and also little bit in the second quarter with that growth rate of next gen console sales being up around the 83%, we start to actually get</p>
<p>Next Gen becomes the clear driver of the console business, and we get to the full open legacy behind us. So that inflection point is happening around now. So, by the time we get to holiday the sales rate of Next Gen should also drive down the impact of the fixed cost in our distribution infrastructure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ed Woo</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Well thank you good luck.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Karen McGinnis</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ed.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question is Ronald Rotter with RLR Partners, please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi Ron.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. I remember if I recall correctly that gross margin on Rock Band 3 was in the 24% to 25% area. And now with co-publishing rights, which I imagine have much higher gross margins associated with that. You had indicated that gross margins on Rock Band 4 would be less than traditional and I don't know which is – and you gross margin has been all over the place, but the tradition is they call of around 30%, are we expecting gross margin in Rock Band 4 to be somewhere in that 27% , 28% area or?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we are not breaking out the margins on the different product lines specifically, but I think when we did Rock Band 3, it dragged the average margins down into the mid-20s and so to the extent that we are targeting around the 30% right for our normal product line that certainly had an impact of dragging it down in and around there. This time around we have got – by doing the actual software publishing in the bundle which gives us a greater value within the bundle, but the bundles themselves are inherently fell in lower margin just because you are giving a lot of additional consumer value in buying multiple products in the software altogether. This summer along with Rock Band 4 we are anticipating to have more bundles from standalone simply because most people don’t have their Rock Band 3 instruments and then secondly the most compelling product is probably back to the band in the box switches a large box with multiple products and has great consumer value.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>And as far as inventory goes, you r inventory was pretty flat with where it was last year at this time when 20% plus decline in sales, is the reason for that being that you already have a meaningful amount of inventory on the books for Rock Band in the June 20 numbers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>No, we are actually seeing really the slowdown in Europe as been the thing this quarter has sat on the inventory front, European sales much softer than expected and most of that inventory is going to be PC products, as well as Next Gen Console products rather than Legacy Console Products.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay so you don't see any markdown much in the way of mark down risk with that excess inventory?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I think we're pretty good on the inventory front on that and it is very forward facing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And you talked about already having pre-orders sales for a Rock Band 4, anything meaningful that you can talk about at this point …</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I can't give actual numbers, but we have been told by retailers that we’re sort of trending in the upper end and I think if you look at how we're training on Amazon, which gives you kind of just another data point there, we sort of make our way into the Top 10, Top 20 products on Amazon on a regular basis. So that’s always a very, very good sign.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>And the revaluation of the Chinese currency is that going to have much of a positive impact on gross margins in the Christmas quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Most of our actual purchases in, coming out of Asia are in US dollars and in some cases Hong Kong dollars, we have some OpEx that runs in RMB. So we're not envisaging anything meaningful coming from there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and then finally I think you kind of indicated this, but as far as the impact on the September quarter you indicated that you would be starting to ship mid-September, is that correct as opposed to the end of the month?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes it is got to be a round the end of the month. The last couple of weeks of September and you know that’s always difficult to know how much will go out in September and how much will go out in October forward, but we will definitely have sales in September and then the bulk of the sales for the year happened in the third quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ronald Rotter</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Darren Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks Ron.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And those are all the questions we are taking at this time. I will now turn the call back over to you Mr. Richardson.</p>
<p><strong>Darren Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks to everyone for joining us on the call today and we look forward to updating you when we get to a physical second quarter 2016 call.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes the conference call for today. We thank you for your participation and ask that you please disconnect your lines.</p>
