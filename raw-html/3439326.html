As many of you know in June the Board of Directors asked me to accept the role of CEO of Cartesian. I would like to thank Don Klumb as well as the Board of Directors for assisting in a seamless CEO transition.</p>
<p>Before I begin talking about our financial results in the second quarter. I wanted to comment briefly on where we are today, what attracted me to this position and what I have learned since taking the helm. Underdone Don's leadership as CEO Cartesian diversified and expanded its service offerings to address higher value consulting engagements and solutions and began the reorganization of the company to build a solid foundation for future growth and profitability. My aim is to build upon the strong progress Cartesian has made over the last few years.</p>
<p>I first joined Cartesians Board in 2012, over the last three years the company realized strong growth and we initiated an effort to augment our legacy as a pure consulting services business with technology centric solutions offerings and now with our recent acquisition of Farncombe, we’re approximately an $85 million business with a broad services and solutions platform and a product of client base and most importantly a phenomenally talented and sought after a group of employees. We have a terrific reputation delivering complicated products be it consulting our solutions to our customers. As I told our employees several times since getting started two months ago, they are the main attraction for me for this job.</p>
<p>The company has all of the ingredients to continue its recent history of growth to improve profitability and to improve its business model. Let me cut to the chase on what I've learned about our company since becoming CEO and what I believe needs to be done to achieve our potential. First and foremost, the organization has undergone a significant amount of change in recent years and the final stages of implementing the reorganization initiated in January, 2014 need to be completed. To the outside world a reorganization such as that one may be a simple exercise of dotted lines on paper and a people based organization such as ours it has profound implications. The concept of the reorganization was the right one, now it needs to be completed in a way that instills basic element of clarity and prove communication to employees regarding expectations, alignment for the people in groups who are working toward common goals and accountability.</p>
<p>Second the concept of investing in our business has been somewhat vague and loosely defined. We are changing the way we consider investments, to be clear investments to us means addition of people outside of the ordinary course of our normal business cycle, expansion of offerings, geographic expansion and any other discrete deployment of capital. When we invested we do so in a planned sought out way with a focus on our long term strategy and returns. We will play to win and we will consider investments in a dual context of risk management and lofty goals. In other words we need to move the needle but in ways that makes sense for us.</p>
<p>As an employee recently remarked to me, we play small roll, well $100,000 to $1 million engagements are in many ways our life blood, but I agree while we close those deals every day we need to be working on a variety of large opportunities that may have long sales cycles. I'm happy to take some of those opportunities that have been identified and are underway. We need more and those opportunities need to compete for our capital and capacity. </p>
<p>Let's turn to our financial results for the second quarter end of July 4, 2015. Revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were 16.9 million, a decrease of 3% from the same year ago period primarily driven by the impact of approximately a $1 million unfavorable change in foreign currency translation along with reductions in total volume of projects in our North American segment. These reductions were partially offset by modest growth in our EMEA segment.</p>
<p>On a non-GAAP constant currency basis, our revenues in the second quarter increased 2% 17.8 million from the same year ago period. Looking at Q2 revenues by geographic region and the portion of each revenues contribution to total revenue on a reported basis, Europe, Middle East and Africa or EMEA accounted for 9.2 million or 55% and North America accounted for 7.7 million or 45%. Going forward we will provide additional breakdown by category of offering to improve the transparency in our reporting. Breaking down Q2 total revenues by source and their percent of total revenue strategy consulting accounted for 1.6 million or 9%, management consulting accounted for 1.1 million or 7%, managed solutions accounted for 2.2 million or 13% and execution accounted for 12 million or 71%.</p>
<p>Our gross profit was 6 million or 32.9% of revenue compared to 6.3 million or 36.4% of revenue and the second quarter of 2014. The decrease in gross profit was primarily due to higher percentage of lower margin services work relative to our higher margin advisory or solutions business. We had a $300,000 inventory reserve included in our cost of goods. This relates to our Elutions partnership and I will elaborate on this later.</p>
<p>There is a natural tradeoff between certainty of revenue from long term and higher volume contracts and margin elevation across the business. To be sure we are focused on expanding margins which will be driven by increasing our mix towards managed solutions and other higher margin offerings. We need to capitalize on our ability to serve the needs of our clients in order to expand our position within the organizations, extend our brand and give us entry into future high margin opportunities. Along those lines one of my key initiatives is to accelerate our transition from a service centric lower margin business model to a higher margin model driven by technology enabled managed solutions and other higher margin offerings. We’re working on our strategy to effect this transition which involves analyzing our go to market approach including future organizational requirements that may enable acceleration.</p>
<p>In Q2 we started to see a favorable mix of higher margin strategy and managed solutions projects particularly in North America. Our EMEA business is showing positive signs of steps taken to accelerate the growth of higher margin offerings on that side of the pond. SG&amp;A expenses in the second quarter of 2015 were 8.2 million compared to 7.8 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to higher non-cash expenses and certain other unusual charges in the quarter of approximately $1 million. The $1 million included a crude executive severance of just under a $0.5 million, $250,000 in expenses related to our strategic acquisition of Farncombe that closed last month and a charge of $256,000 related to our decision to vacate one of our leased office spaces.</p>
<p>I'm committed to making every attempt to align our total cost with the current revenue size and we will be looking at ways to maximize the efficiency of our SG&amp;A dollars. Our GAAP net loss for Q2 2015 totaled 2.8 million or $0.34 per share. This compares to GAAP net income of $87,000 or a penny per share in the second quarter of last year. Our non-GAAP adjusted net loss for the 1.5 million or $0.20 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2015, this compares to non-GAAP adjusted net income of 1.8 million or $0.23 per share in Q2 2014.</p>
<p>Now turning to our balance sheet, at the end of the quarter cash and cash equivalents totaled 11.1 million compared to 13.8 million at the end of the prior quarter. Our net working capital position remains strong at 13.9 million. Now I will turn the call over to Susan for additional comments on the firm's business segments. Susan?</p>
<p><strong>Susan Simmons </strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Peter. During the second quarter we continued to enhance and differentiate our competitive position within the TMT sector, this was demonstrated by a healthy mix of business which spans both longstanding clients and new business wins. As we announced earlier, we expanded our agreement with a longstanding EMEA Tier 1 service provider in Q2, over the years we've delivered a mix of services and technology based solution for this client. More recently we have collaborated with his client on a number of technology based initiatives aimed at improving service delivery to it's customer base.</p>
<p>This contract extension brings the value of the relationship to approximately 34 million including the license with an estimated 28 million to be realized through fiscal 2016. This expansion demonstrates our ability to execute on our long term strategy of penetrating existing clients and selling higher margin technology solutions. It also reflects the long term value we provide to our clients as well as the stickiness of our business model.</p>
<p>We also continue to bolster our sales resources globally to better support a growth initiatives in the second quarter. Along those lines following our EMEA sales team expansion in first quarter we expanded our U.S. business development team with two key hires who are responsible for generating new business and driving solutions based initiatives in North America both individuals have a wealth of experience in selling and delivering solutions to the communications industry. I'm confident and their contributions will further our goal of driving growth in our business by building longer term partnerships with our existing clients as well as expanding our global client base.</p>
<p>We continue to see opportunities globally as providers are investing billions in their networks and services creating significant opportunities for our Cartesian. EMEA continues to produce strong results, for the first six months of the year our revenues from this important region were up compared to the same period last year. These gains are a reflection of strong sales leadership and account management coupled with our efforts to engage clients in new ways. We continue to see opportunities in our largest clients in EMEA although we experience a sequential decline during the quarter. Certain programs we executed were completed and we believe we're now at approximately a sustainable run rate at this stage and in a strong position to capitalize on the Farncombe acquisition. In North America we continue to experience some short term challenges related to sector consolidation which resulted in our revenues declining slightly in the first half of the year. As many of you know several of our large clients including AT&amp;T, ComCast, Time Warner Cable, Frontier and Sprint to name a few have been evolving significantly M&amp;A proceeds in the associated executive and organizational changes.</p>
<p>While M&amp;A activity has proven to be a business driver for us over long term, in the short term it can lead to [indiscernible] program and shifting executive objectives. However as clearing [ph] objectives and management has gained, it opens up significant opportunities for us. We are beginning to see our client activity picking up in North America and we are focused on capturing both the near term services and longer term managed solution opportunities for Cartesian, notably we have already initiated a seven figure engagement with the major service provider that we believe will continue to generate a strong mix of business for us into the second half of 2015 and into 2016.</p>
<p>Now I will pass the call back to Peter. Peter?</p>
<p><strong>Peter Woodward</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Susan. Cartesian has arrived at an inflection point in it's development with a strong potential for growth supported by unique combination of talent, experience and reputation in the markets we served. At the end of last month we expanded our capabilities reach and geographic footprint through the acquisition of Farncombe, a leading consulting and advisory services provider to the Digital TV sector. Farncombe is highly respected in the Digital TV industry but it's leadership and consultants is widely recognized as experts in video content and security across mobile, cable, satellite and broadcast platforms. In addition to a complimentary client base, Farncombe's strength within Digital TV allows us to better support the evolving needs of communication service providers in North America and EMEA. While the quad play may be more mature in North America and Western Europe opportunities still [indiscernible] and offerings of all as more functionality is demanded by customers. Farncombe has the relationships, skill and experience to grow significantly.</p>
<p>We expect the acquisition to provide a tremendous cross selling and up selling opportunities across our combined customer base particularly in strategy and analytics. In fact we’re already realizing synergies from the acquisition in terms of customer activity. Farncombe also enhances our markets goals through its proven experience in deploying and managing large scale projects for the Digital TV industry and further solidifies our quad play position with historical Cartesian customers. Farncombe is on a revenue run rate of approximately £10 million or $15 million, they have a slightly lower gross margin profile in Cartesian but they are comfortably profitable at the current revenue and margin levels. We expect this to be a strongly accretive deal based on the current business although we are working plans immediately to improve their margin profile and scale more efficiently on top of our fixed cost structure.</p>
<p>In terms of deal structure, the purchase price is approximately $6 million but 40% percent of that in the form of a two year earn out and both the initial and earn out payments will be half cash and half stock. In addition, this was an equity purchase of the Farncombe entities and Farncombe's bring with it some cash to us. We expect to complete the integration by the end of Q3 which will help drive new business this year and beyond without any significant successes we expect Farncombe to be accretive to Cartesian on an earnings per share basis.</p>
<p>Finally the cultural fit between our two companies is excellent. The principles the Farncombe has been friends of Cartesian for years, they have excellent relationships across Europe and we believe there will be strong additions to our leadership team. Switching gears to Elutions, as we continue to work with our partners to build pipeline opportunities and bring current opportunities to closure. We’re in discussions with Elutions with respect to certain features of our relationship and believe there are opportunities to adjust their relationships to benefit both sides. Elutions remain not only a business partner but an important shareholder of Cartesian. As previously discussed we and our auditors have assessed the Elutions inventory that is on our balance sheet and determine we should adjust the carrying value of that inventory by $300,000. We will work to realize the entire value of the inventory.</p>
<p>Let me make a few comments on the back half of the year, to build on Susan's comments earlier the North American sales in Q2 were impacted by small number of projects that became victims of the M&amp;A process in certain customers. In addition we experienced losses of certain sales executives earlier in the year. Our outlook for the second half of the year in North America is directionally better. I expect to see sequential growth both North America and EMEA sales in Q3, that will put overall revenues back to a level where we should be approaching if not reaching cash flow neutral for Q3. </p>
<p>On our Q3 call I'll be in a better position to provide more details about 2015 overall. I'm encouraged by our initial progress but we have our work cut out for us. I realize it's important that we act quickly in order to capitalize on the attractive opportunities on the horizon. It's been a whirlwind two months since starting on this job and I want to thank all the team members who have been very supportive. And with that we're ready to open a call for your questions. Operator, please provide the appropriate instruction.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of Orin Hirschman with AIGH Investment Partners. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>You know it's good to hear about getting free cash flow breakeven again, but if I can get more granular you know without knowing even details on the acquisition and knowing that there's some organic growth you know wouldn’t that suggests that there is still a long ways to go on the profitability side for the existing business today in terms of getting to margins going -- in other words, to do with some growth, you have the acquisition there on top of that, the acquisition is profitable, the additional growth should help you. I guess not [indiscernible] but why isn't there more of a swing in terms of overall profitability or cash flow positive aspect.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Depending on the turn in the revenues and the mix of revenues that come in Q3, there could be a greater swing but as we said right now not forecasting a dramatic sudden turnaround. The prudent forecast for us right now is to enough growth to get us back to right around that level and managing expenses plus and Farncombe and probably makes feel pretty good about being right around or act like even from a cash flow standpoint.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Can you talk more if you can about Elutions in terms of anything you can say further and if you can't say anything further when do you think you'll have more to say further?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>I can tell you that we remain in a position of having customers in the pipeline. I think we've all been waiting patiently for customers to close. There are features in a relationship as I’ve said in my comments that we feel at this point this far into the relationship we could look at it just to benefit both sides, and so in terms of when you say wait to hear news in terms of any adjustment to that. I don't have a specific timing on it, we're talking regularly about it and I hope we could get to some quick resolution on that. And in terms of the custom up front we remain patient where we believe that our customers that could come to fruition and so I don't have a much more granular timetable to offer to you today. I'm sorry I wish I did, we’re long into this relationship and are looking for some business closing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>Then just thinking the next quarter, the quarter we’re now do you’ve a good [indiscernible] call or more people?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>I do, I think there is that chance yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>And my last question is returning growth to buyback, you know some of the cash on the balance sheet, any thoughts there? Any revenue -- buyback I think would be talking [indiscernible] time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes I think we're going to look and having now reported these results and as we get more clarity on, as we go through Q3 and how the Q3 results look I think you know we're looking to deploy capital and way it makes the most sense for shareholders and we're going to watch stock--</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, [indiscernible] not much more than roughly twice cash on a company of size you’re turning it positive, anything you do to shrink the share count make a huge difference.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Got it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Stevens, Private Investor. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I have a couple of questions, you made a reference to reducing the Elutions inventory. I think you said from 400,000 to a 100,000, what are you referring to by the Elutions inventory?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>The comment was that we took a reserve against the Elutions inventory, we have $3 million of inventory that’s associated with the Elutions Aleutians relationship, it's Elutions product that as per our agreement sits on our balance sheet we took an accounting valuation allowance against 3 million the amount was 300,000 and so at the current value on our books now is 2.7 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And Peter do you think that the change in management, the change in the position that you are now in any way does that have the potential to breathe life into thus far I think by any standard failed partnership. In other words is the change of management in any way going to positively affect that relationship or no?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>I mean there's really two levels to your question, there is the personal relationship between management teams, between companies and then there is the company the strategy to drive commercial success. The change between -- the leadership of Cartesian has minimal effect on the commercial success of the Elutions in the market. Does that improve communications or the change gives an occasion for a lot of communication between companies. So to the extent that accelerating the pace is not for a period of time, hopefully ongoing if that improves the relationship between the companies then yes there has been a lot of communication off late. But the Elutions sale in the marketplace is a long complicated large enterprise sale. The change in Cartesian's leadership isn't going to be the determining factor of this success of the Elutions sale in the market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and did I understand correctly in the last call that the direct cost that Cartesian incurs on a quarterly basis to support that partnership is about $400,000 per quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>So we look at that number pretty regularly, I think that number now is probably a little bit lower than that, there are direct cost through the contract that we pay and through the coupon payment on the note that Elutions has with us and then it's essential people's time after that and I think the number is probably slightly lower than that but in the low 100s to 1000s dollars.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So you know basically I guess what I'm saying first of all every partnership doesn't work. And to date this this one really hasn't lived up to expectations. You know $300,000 - $400,000 or quarter to support it is a good chunk of change for Cartesian, I mean do we get to a point sometime later this year where we just say, hey it hasn't worked, it's not worth the overhead to support it. And do we just cut the cord and move on?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>We have a contract with Elutions that commits to various facets of the relationship. I think really at this point we're focused on trying to make sure that we have a relationship between the two companies that works for both sides and in order to drive commercial success. This is well I understand your point this works out best for all of us if we have commercial success in the marketplace and the Cartesian [indiscernible] can be rewarded by the investment that's been made to-date. So the discussions that we're having with Elutions are about how to achieve success in the marketplace. They are large shareholders of the company I think they'd like to support the company and do what's best for Cartesian on that front. And so I am certainly optimistic that we'll be able to have a commercial relationship with Cartesian that fits for both sides and allows us to continue to shoot for commercial success in the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well I think what I'm hearing is we're not ready to give up on it yet and as long as the pipeline still has potential, I certainly understand that. Listen my final question is on an unrelated topic. The company at least since my involvement which has been I guess about 18 months now maybe two years, the company has really had a policy of not updating shareholders on meaningful developments and events with a very few exception to that, the company has not updated shareholders between quarterly calls on not necessarily earthshattering homerun type but just on things that would be meaningful if someone looking at the company either as a shareholder or potentially considering taking a position in the company things like new customer wins, expansions with existing customers. A lot of times we hear what I think would be newsworthy events in the call which might have had an impact if they had come at the time they occurred.</p>
<p>The company also puts out a quarterly industry newsletter that's got a whole section dedicated to recent achievements and many of those things are very newsworthy especially for a company Cartesian size with you now taking the helm. Can we, maybe hope some change in that policy so that we are a little more up to date and then in tune with events as they happen?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Not to make no point about the company's policies before, we certainly will do the best we can to try to inform all of our shareholders about how we're doing to the extent that there are discreet items that are either announceable or referenceable. We'll certainly do our best to try to get those out into the public. We do all the time it's not always easy with customer especially with large customers who are sensitive to either names or strategies that they are working on, being referenced even without their names publicly. So I know you understand the challenges Neil and so about getting specific customer related items out in the public but to the extent that we can and there are items that are in those newsletters, we'll try to do as good a job as we can to get out there in public and we augmented the disclosure a little bit this quarter providing the segment results and so we will try to continue to improve the information flow.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Well I think a lot of people would certainly support that Peter and news flow is the lifeblood of a micro-cap company and I would just encourage you every few weeks to look at what might be meaningful and see if it's appropriate for periodic announcements and I'd also like to echo the sentiment of one of the previous callers. If we're not going to buy back stock at these levels then you know really why not just cancel the buyback program, it's been there now for quite some time it hasn't been used and I think obviously with the stock at the levels it's been for the last few quarters it's certainly a good use of cash versus what it's getting in the bank.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Bill Sutherland with Emerging Growth Equities. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>A number of questions I’ve been asked. I was curious on the sales turnover that you experienced early on the year. Was that just normal poaching or was it somewhat related to you know some internal issues?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>I wouldn't say I'd call it internal issues, I think we're dealing with customers that are large customers and we have a group of sales people and that group has had grown since the reorganization we initiated 18 months ago and these are sales people who are sought after, they have relationships with Tier 1 carriers and cable and they can go and do a variety of different things and so we did have some losses, we did -- we filled two spots in this past quarter with people who I think are very, very strong and bring great relationships and great skill sets for us. So it impacted Q2 revenues and we're trying to make sure we get people who have joined the organization as productive as possible as quickly as possible and we're looking at our entire customer base to figure out where resources makes sense.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>Are you back to where you were or do you have hires to go or you want to go to a higher number?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>We are right about where we were I guess coming into the year and in terms of going further and making the group larger I think there is -- if you look at our customers, their spend and the marketplace the customers that we don't serve today it would be very easy to come to a conclusion that we should add lots of sales people. I think we want to do it and per my commentary about making investments in our business we want to do this in a smart way that plans and it will only give sales people or anyone else to join the firm the best chance for success. So I wouldn't [indiscernible] go and run out and add a lot of people quickly but we serve very large customers in very large markets. And where you could even get to a conclusion that we could add a lot more, so we're going to look at it carefully over the next few months.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>The last thing I was hoping you might spend some time on as you mentioned you know wanting to putting emphasis behind margin strategic or strategy businesses and also the managed solutions I guess what -- if you can just be a little more detailed in terms of what you would like to see happen other than to [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I mean I think it's any time you have a leadership change like we've had it's a good opportunity to kind of pause and say take a look at what we're doing, what's working and what we can do better where we could make more investment, where other ideas that should compete for capital dollars or investment or development dollars and so it involves looking at our go to market so I know other avenues that we can pursue that would accelerate our go to market and involves looking if we were to spend development dollars in one particular area or another, how would we prioritize that, as you can imagine sort of stopping it taking a stab shot of your business and the growth opportunities. I think there's no question there are significant growth opportunities in front of us, the [indiscernible] business including the sort of managed solutions we have today and our analytics practices can all grow dramatically. I think it's worth looking at how we can accelerate that, how we can do it in a capital efficient way and in a risk managed way so that -- some of these can be can large but competitive markets we're not the only ones who have found the analytics market and so we want to make sure we're differentiating, we want to make sure we're deploying capital smartly and that and that we're doing what we can to grow most efficiently. So I wouldn't say that I see a dramatic change in the offering per se or I think it's really more operationally how we’re approaching it, how we're going to market, where we can invest dollars and how we can do it with the best chance of success.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>So I mean I guess what you're saying is I just want to put more resources behind the particular offerings that you think you know will respond the most and that's obviously that's clearly kind of goes without saying.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>There could be other ways to do it too but aren't specifically putting more capital behind it. So we're working with partners that are our role example in our sales group are mostly direct sales people, there maybe areas where other types of go to market strategies are relevant that all of that all takes a little bit of looking at kind of where we've had success, where we have run in the road blocks, where we’re differentiated. That's the work that is getting done now, to try to see whether there are avenues in a cost efficient way to try to accelerate the growth. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Richard Nespola [ph], a Private Investor. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to ask about the Farncombe acquisition, just a couple of questions. Number one as an observation I think it's very dynamic opportunity for you and the company in particular throughout EMEA as you develop a lot of expertise here in North America and it certainly can be used by the Farncombe team. My question focuses on what is the typical client engagement for them? The type of work, the level of the sponsorship, the size of the engagement in both the number of people and size of turnover?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Susan Simmons</span></strong></p>
<p>There is a range of like Cartesian which as Peter indicated in and we indicated in our communications about the deal, there is a lot of complimentary aspect to Farncombe with Cartesian. They have some very large engagements that go beyond one year associated with deployment of next generation set top boxes or platforms to support content delivery and content management. I mean there are some sort of term engagements that are done under fixed price structure and they have some recurring business associated with security audit. So they have a range of businesses similar to Cartesian that range from multi-months, multi-year to shorter term fixed price and that’s probably about the most I can tell you at this stage.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm sure you’ve looked at the numbers and the type of engagement just for resource allocation and yield. So is that information going to be available subsequently?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Specifically in terms of what the deal size is for?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes typical deal size and how many people have to be deployed? What the level of sponsorship is at the sea level? The sea level which type of sea level? I think those are important dynamics when looking at the opportunity. So it's not available now, it certainly can wait for an update but I think that’s a very important in any kind of consult engagement.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes I think we’re probably happy to talk about [indiscernible] it seems -- I'm not sure about the public disclosure of specific information at what level we're going into customers but I think we would be more than happy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>How many customer names it's a generic engagement, you know for example let's say a typical engagement average is in turn over £50,000, a £100,000 and five people things of that nature, I'm not looking for specificity of client.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Susan Simmons</span></strong></p>
<p>I would say at a very cursory level, it is very similar to Cartesian doing business on average basis and on an average project size basis. So if you look at the averages Rich on a persons deployed and an average revenue, it's very much like Cartesian in EMEA.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And only if you know and you may not, are you doing any work in UHD, the Ultra High Definition?</p>
<p>A <strong>Susan Simmons</strong></p>
<p>I think it's probably fair to say that is an issue associated with some other client and we believe it will be an ongoing issue where they are not addressing to the client. So it represents an upsell opportunity on some client engagements and resell opportunity where they have already worked with client on that area.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And I'm assuming that they are aligned with the [indiscernible] standards if they are doing a DRM and cryptography which in your 8K filing appears that they do.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Susan Simmons</span></strong></p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>My second thing is just a follow up on Elutions just an observation more directed towards Peter, Peter I am pleased to hear that you’re listening to shareholders. I'm pleased to hear about your recent reevaluation of the deal structure and right down of inventory. I view it as a positive step. There were other questions about Elutions but I have one more specific one, you gave a number of approximately a couple $100,000 per quarter. Previously you used to burn about a couple of $100,000 per quarter in R&amp;D, I'm you curious about whether any and if so how much subcontractor payments two Elutions during this quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>To my knowledge I don't think there were any in Q2, I don't believe there were any made in Q2.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Michael Melby with Gate City Capital Management. Please proceed. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Melby</span></strong></p>
<p>I was hoping you could address the cost structure of the business and if you think it's at a level that will allow for profitability over the long term maybe exclude the recent acquisition.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. I think excluding the recent acquisition the margin level we could go about making sure we achieve a reasonable margin and you and I could sit and discuss what a reasonable margin is but a reasonable operating margin, either true growth or by managing costs, were given the volatility that we experienced in revenue in-line over the last few months. Some actions have been taken on the cost front, we’re kind of had reason to believe that the revenue line would improve and so we're I think being prudent to not cut deep right in front of revenue growth and we're watching to see how the revenues develop.</p>
<p>In the long term I think we have a sense of what reasonable margins are and let's call those operating margin and growth of investments that we might make but I think the business is situated in a place today where execution and growth and as we’ve articulated driving business that is at higher margins can result in a reasonable operating margin within a very reasonable time as always any time during a change like this we're going to look at product cost, we did look on product [ph] costs during the quarter. In the second quarter we executed on, you know on a few items there are some spots where we had some employee turnover that we just didn't fill and so from the SG&amp;A level that you see today backing out the onetime adjustments that we identified in a press release. The ongoing SG&amp;A is lower, there are probably a few other items that were in the quarter that might have caused SG&amp;A to be unusually high although it's sort of discrete onetime items that we would put in a bucket and carve out.</p>
<p>So I think the ongoing SG&amp;A is likely to be lower and can result in -- put us closer to what's a desirable operating income or EBITDA margin. So it's a long way thing I think we're not far off from being able to achieve that. If you normalize out the SG&amp;A structure and made some assumption about some sequential revenue improvement we're not far off of achieving a reasonable margin level. But that's certainly the goal is to any time we’re in a quarter with a loss, the first goal is to get it back to generating a positive cash. The second goal is to get it up to a reasonable margin and that's what we're shooting for.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Melby</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there any run-rate on the base business for SG&amp;A that we should think about going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>So I think if you knocked everything out today, all the onetime items and made some assumptions about some of the kind of unusually high items were probably in the high sixes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Melby</span></strong></p>
<p>And can you talk about what gives the conviction that Q3 will be better than Q2 on an operating basis?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Well we’re halfway through it and that helps and the pipeline of activities looks better and so the items that caused the shortfalls are staying with North America in Q2, there were some discrete projects that were tied to customers and that we’re going through M&amp;A processes and I don't think we have a lot of exposure to events like that for example in Q3 or Q4, I think there is more upside and we talked in the press release, in our comments about for example a new logo that's come on stream that's providing a nice amount of growth. So I think in general there are more positives in the pipeline without the kind of risk associated with customers that are going through M&amp;A process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Melby</span></strong></p>
<p>And maybe finally I guess given your investment history and looking at a number of years of losses for Cartesian, how do you think about from a value standpoint of the company is worth more as a standalone company or perhaps combine later with the larger company?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>I think from -- if we were to think about what's a reasonable valuation for a company it obviously depends a lot on the operating performance, if the performance isn't good and we have a hard time maintaining profitability then the valuation we could expect wouldn’t be as great if we achieve the performance that I think is readily achievable and we were to think about you know a valuation as a multiple of EBITDA or as you know on some multiple of revenues based on you know synergies on an EBITDA level that acquire [ph] can achieve I think the value is much higher.</p>
<p>I mean I think the values are always higher in a transaction depending on the timing and the growth expectations. So it has a lot to do with how the company can grow, how it can succeed and it's operating. So if we're growing much more aggressively and generating nice margins on that growth and everything is positive then I think the returns by continuing to see growth can be very desirable as opposed to going and looking for a transaction sooner. So I think it just depends on how we're able to get through this period and realize the growth that I think is readily achievable.</p>

<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our next question is a follow-up from Orin Hirschman with AIGH Investment Partners. Please proceed. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>Just as a follow-up, the Elutions inventory, wasn’t that related to an initial installation for your first customer, and if not can you clarify for us?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. I mean it's related, although it's not inventory for that customer, it's for that the commercial agreement with Elutions was a purchase of inventory to sit on our balance sheet was triggered by our first customer or first amount of revenue which for us happen to be almost exactly to the dollar, the amount tied to the first customer that we had. So that triggered purchasing inventory the logic behind it when the deal was struck was significant pipeline as revenues start to come in, their supply chain issues etcetera and inventory should be purchased in advance. So that's what triggered the purchase of the inventory and we've had the one customer without subsequent customers behind it to consume that inventory.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>How is that customer by the way doing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>I think well, the deployment has gone on for a period of time. It's coming to completion and from what we hear from the customer, they seem happy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Orin Hirschman</span></strong></p>
<p>It's going to be recurring revenue for you, it maybe not be seven figures but I think it's close.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Woodward</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes and some of it has to do with the savings that are achieved from that customer and they seem to be pleased with the savings so far.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. At this time this concludes our question and answer session. I would now like to turn the call back over to Mr. Woodward for his closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Woodward</strong></p>
