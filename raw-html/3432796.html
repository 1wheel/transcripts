<p>I would now turn the conference over to Mr. John Sweeney, Vice President, Investor Relations. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
<p><strong>John Sweeney</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, and good morning everyone. Welcome to VWR's second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. I am John Sweeney, VP of Investor Relations and joining me today are Manuel Brocke-Benz, President and CEO; and Greg Cowan, SVP and CFO.</p>
<p>Manuel will lead the discussion providing overall comments on VWR's financial and operational performance. Greg will then walk through the results of operations and our financial outlook for the rest of the year. Manuel will then wrap up our prepared remarks with some closing comments. And I'd note there is a slide deck accompanying this call on our investor website at investors.vwr.com. Following prepared remarks we will open up the lines for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>I'd like to note that we will be making some statements during the call that are forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Federal Securities laws, including statements regarding events or developments we believe or anticipate may occur in the future. These forward-looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties, including those set forth in our SEC filings.

<p>Now, I will turn the call over to our CEO, Manuel Brocke-Benz. Manuel?</p>
<p><strong>Manuel Brocke-Benz</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, John, and good morning everyone. Our second quarter 2015 financial results clearly demonstrate the multiple levers that VWR is utilizing to drive double digit earnings growth. The Americas segment posted organic growth of 4.7% and EMEA-APAC segment also had an organic increase of 4.7%.</p>
<p>At the halfway point in the year, we are now tracking at an organic revenue growth rate of 4.2%, thus our long term organic growth expectations are 3 to 4%.</p>
<p>Despite the significant currency headwind caused by the year-over-year strengthening of the dollar versus the euro, operating income margins extended as the company continues to leverage infrastructure over higher organic revenue base.</p>
<p>In addition our financial results benefited from the continued successful execution of our ongoing acquisition strategy. Our efforts to delever the balance sheet and reduce interest cost also contributed to a meaningful increase in our earnings.</p>
<p>Second quarter 2015 net interest expense was $28.4 million, down $16.5 million or 37% as compared to the prior year quarter. Collectively these factors drove second quarter 2015 adjusted EPS of $0.34, up 42% as compared to $0.24 in the second quarter of last year.</p>
<p>As we will discuss our results continue to be significantly impacted by currency on both the top and bottom line. Nevertheless, we are once again able to deliver strong revenue performance and the significant earnings increase. This result underscores the resilience of VWRs business model and the multiple levers we have available to drive our earnings growth into the future.</p>
<p>Moving onto Slide 7, EMEA-APAC segment revenue grew 4.7% on an organic basis in the second quarter. This level of performance was an improvement as compared to the 1.9% organic growth rate we experienced in the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>As we mentioned on our prior call, once we got past the timing of Easter, which fell in early April of this year as opposed to mid-April last year, our organic growth trends improved to a more normalized level.</p>
<p>The ongoing weakening of the euro and other currencies continued to weigh on our EMEA-APAC results reducing revenues by 17.9% as compared to prior year. Operating income declined from $39.5 million in last year's quarter to $36.4 million in the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Excluding currency and acquisitions operating income margin was 8.5% up 40 basis point year-over-year. Now that we have annualized impact of the change in the MERCK contract, we’re pleased to see that our operating income margin expansion has returned to the EMEA-APAC segments.</p>
<p>EMEA-APAC sales to biopharma customers increased double-digit, the strong growth in VWR catalyst services and a high level of equipments sales. We continue to see a trend with major accounts who are purchasing more services and a wider portfolio of that lab research or production related products beyond our traditional catalog product.</p>
<p>Sales to healthcare customers increased mid-single digit. Education and government were both down slightly as sales to government customers reflected ongoing budgetary constraints and lower equipment and instruments sales.</p>
<p>Industrial revenues were up moderately. From a product perspective, sales of chemicals were up mid-single digits on strong sales to biopharma customers. Consumables increased mid-single digits, while capital goods were up low-single digits.</p>
<p>Moving onto the Americas segment on Slide 9. In the second quarter the Americas segment continued on its solid growth trajectory. Despite a more difficult comp than the first quarter, Americas organic revenue growth was 4.7% in the second quarter of 2015. This represents our fifth consecutive quarter of organic revenue growth and we believe that this provides clear evidence that the Americas turnaround has indeed materialized.</p>
<p>With our scalable infrastructure, we saw our solid organic revenue growth translate into robust Americas operating income growth with operating income of $41.2 million up from $22.5 million in the prior year quarter. Excluding currency, acquisitions, last year's impairment charge, and expenses related to our June secondary offering, operating income increased $6.0 million or 17.8%.</p>
<p>In the Americas the second quarter exhibited a similar strong trend versus our first quarter performance. The Americas segment showed continued strength in biopharma, excluding acquisitions biopharma sales increased at a low double-digit rate. We continue to see large biopharma customers leveraging our integrated procurement services and extending purchasing beyond our catalog product.</p>
<p>Healthcare sales were up mid-single digits. Education was up mid-single digits. We see continued strength in the sales to Universities partially offset by weakness in sales to our K212 customers.</p>
<p>Sales to government entities were up mid-single digits. Finally we had a mid-single decline in industrial performance, which was driven by account churn.</p>
<p>From a product perspective, net sales of chemicals increased double-digits, consumables increased low-single digits and sales of equipment and instruments increased high-single digits.</p>
<p>Okay. With that, I will now turn the call over to Greg and discuss financials and outlook. Greg.</p>
<p><strong>Greg Cowan</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Manuel, and again good morning everyone. I am on Slide 12 of the earnings deck. We reported second quarter revenues of $1.08 billion, down 1.9% compared to the prior year on a reported basis, but up 4.7% on an organic basis.</p>
<p>Currency particularly the euro reduced sales by 8.6%, while acquisitions added an additional 2% to our growth. Our organic revenue performance was the result of solid volume growth in biopharma revenues, but also from strength in healthcare and University education customers.</p>
<p>Our consolidated gross margin was 27.6%, down 60 basis points compared to prior year. Excluding the impact of the revision of our product cost standards for our manufacturing businesses, gross margins would have declined approximately 20 basis points compared to second quarter of 2014. This decline was primarily driven by unfavorable product mix and foreign exchange fluctuations.</p>
<p>Second quarter SG&amp;A expenses were $220.9 million, down 11.4% compared to the prior year. SG&amp;A was 20.4% of revenues, down 220 basis points compared to prior year. There were several distinct items impacting the SG&amp;A line.</p>
<p>The second quarter of 2015 benefited from the revision of our product cost standards for our manufacturing businesses, which reduced SG&amp;A by approximately $4 million. The second quarter of 2015 included secondary offering expenses of $900,000 and a $200,000 non-cash earn-out benefit.</p>
<p>Also the prior quarter includes an $11.3 million impairment charge associated with the resented M&amp;A transaction. Excluding these items and also excluding the impact of currency and acquisitions, SG&amp;A was 20.5% of sales down 110 basis points as compared to prior year. Operating income was $77.6 million, up $15.6 million or 25.2% compared to the prior year.</p>
<p>Moving on items below operating income. Second quarter net interest expense was $28.4 million, $16.5 million lower than the prior year. The reduction in interest expense was principally due to the repayment of the 10.75% senior subordinated notes, which we repaid during the fourth quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>Other income and expenses primarily comprised of exchange gains and losses associated with the revaluation of certain portions of our euro denominated debt. We recognized net exchange losses of $18.6 million for the three months ended June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>The 2015 tax rate used to calculate adjusted EPS is now anticipated to be 37% up 100 basis points from our previous estimate. This increase is primarily due to mix shift in earnings with the higher proportion of earnings now expected to be generated in higher tax jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Second quarter 2015 adjusted EPS was $0.34, up 41.7% compared to the prior year. So as you can see VWR is continuing its strong profile of adjusted EPS growth.</p>
<p>The growth drivers available to drive double-digit EPS growth include market growth, our growth enhancers, private label and services, accretive acquisitions, operating margin expansion and deleveraging our balance sheet.</p>
<p>Let’s take a quick look and what we have achieved in the last couple of years. In 2013, our adjusted EPS increased 21%. In 2014 it increased 28%, and now we’re tracking up 28% for the first half of 2015. We view our year-to-date performance as a very high level of adjusted EPS growth and do not expect to achieve this rate for ever. Nonetheless, we're pleased with our performance and we do expect our track record of double-digit adjusted EPS growth to continue.</p>
<p>The number of diluted shares used to calculate adjusted EPS was $132.1 million in the second quarter of 2015. And we expect the weighted average share count to be slightly north of 132 million shares for the full year.</p>
<p>Moving on to cash flows and liquidity; operating cash flow was $107 million, double the level we had in last year’s second quarter, benefiting from lower cash interest and year-over-year improvements in our working capital profile.</p>
<p>We continue to expect operating cash flow of $225 million for the full year 2015. Capital expenditures were $7 million resulting in second quarter free cash of $100 million, a record quarterly cash flow level for VWR. We utilized a total of $26 million of net cash primarily for the acquisition of Hichrom in the second quarter of this year. For 2015 we continue to anticipate CapEx spending of about $45 million.</p>
<p>As you can see on slide 14, VWR continue to be deleverage balance sheet. And during the remainder of 2015, should interest rates remain at or near current levels we anticipate refinancing and extending the remaining portion of our outstanding debt. The refinancing and our ongoing deleveraging has the potential to significantly lower interest costs and drive shareholder value.</p>
<p>Excess cash flow after M&amp;A activity will be utilized to continue the delever and strengthen our balance sheet, reducing our interest costs as we move forward. Now let me move on to our reaffirmed 2015 guidance, which is shown on slide 15.</p>
<p>Our longer term expectations for organic revenue growth of about 3% to 4% and adjusted EBITDA, excluding currency and acquisitions in the range of 7% to 8%. We anticipate that we will achieve this level of performance for the full year 2015.</p>
<p>Currently about 50% of our revenues come from outside the U.S. A majority of foreign revenues are Euro denominated, with the remainder in such currencies as the Canadian dollar, the British pound, and a number of other additional currencies.</p>
<p>On our previous call, we communicated that we anticipated a Euro dollar exchange rate of approximately 1.12. Assuming constant exchange rate this represents approximately 7% headwind to fiscal 2015 revenues as well as adjusted EBITDA. Despite this headwind, we continue to expect 2015 revenues in the range of $4.24 billion to $4.31 billion.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA is expected to be in the range of $456 million to $463 million. Our adjusted EBITDA guidance excludes share base compensation expense. We continue to expect 2015 adjusted EPS in the range of a $1.42 to $1.50.</p>
<p>Our adjusted EPS guidance includes approximately $5 million to $6 million of pretax share base compensation expense for 2015. There are a couple of puts and takes you should consider embedded within our guidance. With regard to currency, since our last earnings call the Euro has traded slightly below our expectation of a $1.12.</p>
<p>And we are now facing a higher tax rate in 2015 as compared to forecast on our last earnings call. On a positive side, we continue to delever our balance sheet and to reduce our interest costs. Should interest rates remain at or about current rates, we will have the opportunity to refinance our debt later in 2015.</p>
<p>So acknowledging that we are seeing various puts and takes in our outlook, we are reaffirming our guidance for the full year 2015. Our 2015 earnings will flow from normal seasonal progression with three similar quarters in the first, second, and third quarters, and a seasonally strong fourth quarter to finish off the full year.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll hand the call over to Manuel, for business highlights and closing comments. Manuel?</p>
<p><strong>Manuel Brocke-Benz</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Greg. I would like to take this opportunity to discuss one of VWRs key competitive advantages, and that is our globally integrated IT infrastructure. Over the past several years we made substantial investments in our IT platform, including our ERP system and global web platform.</p>
<p>And these investments have proven to be an effective enabler of growth and have generated significant return. VWR has a truly Pan-European IT infrastructure, one that has leveraged a single instance ERP system. This facilitates enhanced sales growth, transaction efficiency, operating leverage, and increased customer reach.</p>
<p>Our European IT infrastructure is a key contributor to the number one European market position that we hold, and we have implemented a similar instance of SAP in the Americas and are seeing similar benefits. Now VWR has a standardized backbone with advanced IT reporting capabilities that provide significant differentiation for all our customers.</p>
<p>On the frontend, our ongoing development of our global web platform is targeted to enhance the customer experience, drive efficiencies into our customer service organization that's freeing up time in our call centers so that the VWR service professionals have more time to spend on consultative and value added into actions with our customers.</p>
<p>We are also adding more differentiators to the web platform like antibody configurator, the eMolecules portal, while at the same time providing a high degree of individualized customization capabilities, all of which add value for our customers.</p>
<p>As we move forward, we will continue to innovate our IT platform, which we believe will continue to enhance the customer experience and drive gross.</p>
<p>Moving on to Slide 18, we continue to have a solid financial performance in 2015. We remain encouraged about our organic performance. We have exciting initiative to strengthen our balance sheet and delever, and we continue to execute on our acquisitions strategy that can deliver substantial value.</p>
<p>Our second quarter performance confirms that we are executing on our plan and these results clearly indicate that the VWR growth story remains on track. I want to take the opportunity to thanks the entire VWR team around the globe for the strong performance in the second quarter of 2015 and their continued dedication to VWR.</p>
<p>With that, I would now like to open the call for questions. Operator?</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Tycho Peterson from JPMorgan. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning guys. Wanted to may be just dive in to some of the color on the industrial what you say you called out, I know you talked about account churn, I think last quarter you talked about single electronic customer. Can you maybe just talk a little bit about the gives and takes that you’re seeing in that market and what you’re expectations are in the back half of the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Manuel. Actually we are not commenting on individual customers. We are just saying there is some account churn in industrial and this can go either way depending on how the year evolves.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And your expectation for Americas industrial in the back half of the year? Can you talk a little bit about?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>It will be similar and might improve a little bit, but again it's very difficult to judge at this point in time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Then how about on biopharma, you obviously had double digit growth there for a couple of quarters now. Can you just talk about your visibility either at channel and how you see the business playing out?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we see continued growth in biopharma and just more R&amp;D spending that we are seeing in the market, but also shifting some of the purchasing activities to where we are as we have talked about in the previous call.</p>
<p>That trend seems to be continuing and we are confident that we will have a good growth story for pharma also in the second half of 2015.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then a couple for Greg here, first on channel, we've got a number of questions in general on China for the segment. Can you maybe just talk about your exposure there especially given the evaluation how do you think about your impacts?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>On China it’s a relatively small component of our business. We basically have a services model in China as opposed to a distribution model. And we think that provides the highest value to our global customers that are uncommon there.</p>
<p>So relatively small operation - when it impacts us one way or the other some of the economic disruption that we are hearing about.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>And then given any creep-up in tax rate that you talked about there, things that you are looking at levers, that you could maybe pull over the medium to longer term to try to bring the tax rate down a bit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes certainly, we actively manage our tax rate. We have various tax planning strategies in place, but we’re always looking to improve. We don't comment on individual tax strategies or the orientation, but certainly we are working to get that tax rate down over the next couple of years.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just lastly can you remind us just how you’re thinking about the steady state leverage profile for the business, I mean should we think about what kind of leverage is kind of for here in the near-term.</p>
<p>And then you mentioned potentially refinancing, I’m wondering if you have any thoughts on what that potentially do to bottom line?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure. In terms of leverage I mean our goal with our capital deployment strategy is to continue to naturally deleverage our balance sheet. So we would expect free cash flow this year of about $180 million, about $50 million to $75 million going towards acquisition.</p>
<p>So toward the end of the year we would expect some more natural deleveraging on our balance sheet against the seasonally high cash inflow during our fourth quarter.</p>
<p>So we hope to in the next two or three years be operating generally in the low 3 range, but not an exact target for us, because we do continue to invest in M&amp;A, which we think is high value to our shareholders.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>And then on refinancing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, on the refinancing certainly the markets look good. We have reasons to refinance. We have $750 million or so of senior notes that 7.75% and normally we would think that we would see about 300 basis point arbitrage on a refinancing and that would create the nice interest expense reduction in 2016 going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tycho Peterson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Derik de Bruin from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Derik de Bruin</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. What’s the full year impact on M&amp;A for the top line?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Through the first half, acquisitions have contributed about 2% to our topline. We still have some acquisition activity that is wrapping around in the residual part of the year. So that gives you at least some senses to the general scope of the wrap out.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Derik de Bruin</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. And can you just give a quick reminder on the customer breakdown by segment for the full company just as I said we're dealing a lot of questions about industrial and like that. So can you give us the breakdown of buckets for biopharma, healthcare, education, government, industrial just to refresh us?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>The biggest segment is obviously biopharma and followed by industrial and then we have the education piece and the healthcare. And let me get you here the breakdown. So biopharma is actually 42% of our business then you have 24% in industrial. And then education 14.4% and healthcare 7.3% and the remainder is spread between government and others.</p>
<p>Slightly higher percentage of biopharma in the Americas compared to Europe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Derik de Bruin</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Doug Schenkel from Cowen and Company. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning guys. Just I guess a couple follow-up questions on end market. In the industrial end market you did talk about account churn, I don’t think you talked a ton about how demand has been evolving in the midst of - some of the building macro concerns.</p>
<p>Anything you can share there and some of that can be qualitative if you want to get quantitative, it would be great to hear if there is anything you can share like book-to-bill?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, in general we're seeing a good development. We already talked about in the past about this one semiconductor customer that didn't do so well or we didn’t have the major sales to them or a decline in sales. Again that seem to be coming to bottom and we hope to see some pickup in the second half of 2015 there.</p>
<p>Overall the underlying business is sought and we're seeing some growth there. But again we marked here the account churn as an element for the second quarter which I think is a fair assessment, but that doesn't mean that we’ll continue.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then on pharma obviously, a key area of focus for you and for others in the group and it’s really been a continued bright spot. Any more specific commentary to provide on how much of this is demand versus share gains versus mix when it comes to VWR specifically?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>Like we have mentioned on previous calls, a big part of the growth comes from purchasing services, but also our services that we provide to customers. Those are the two biggest growth drivers for us.</p>
<p>But, then there is an underlying growth in the market and more research happening and thus more demand for products from us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And last one, what was private label revenue growth in the quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it was roughly 8%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>Slightly above that, I think.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Doug Schenkel</span></strong></p>
<p>Slightly above that, okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Brandon Couillard from Jefferies. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brandon Couillard</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks good morning. Manuel, you mentioned the VWR catalyst uptick, I would be curious if you could just quantify the growth of services overall for you in period, and kind of speak to where you kind of see the opportunity there, whether in terms of penetration or number of accounts just on the runway in front of you for the services business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>I mean, we see a double-digit growth in services. Actually across the globe, and what’s happening is here you have some pilots certainly on the scientific services and word gets around with other customers and we have some more pilots happening there, its not something that will jump in big steps, because its a conservative customer base that needs to get used to new concept.</p>
<p>But we feel confident that we have a good value proposition especially for our pharma accounts and we will continue to see growth.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brandon Couillard</span></strong></p>
<p>Superb. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question is from Isaac Ro from Goldman Sachs. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Isaac Ro</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning guys, thank you. Just two questions, one on biopharma, the other one on the private label strategy. On biopharma, could you talk a little bit about, sort of delineating where the strength that you saw was, whether it'd be on the production side or in products side, more to research, was there a discernable trend, because it seems like the biopharma production side of the marketplace has been quite strong year-to-date, and I’m just curious if there was a material difference from the research side of your customer base there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Not completely, like I mentioned, a big growth driver is procurement services and services as such, though that’s even outside the product area. But we see good growth both on the production side as well on the research side. No real difference.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Isaac Ro</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. And then on the private label, just -- I think you gave a little bit of a growth picture there, but curious on what the margin contribution has been and maybe if you could outline your strategy I think to use private label to help you get into new end markets, kind of where you stand with that initiative? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I mean again, like we always mentioned, private label is a strategy certainly not to cannibalize existing branded business. And therefore we don’t have a target as such, we just see the opportunity of getting into adjacent private areas whether it’s in healthcare or whether it’s in safety with private label ranges.</p>
<p>And we are constantly looking our portfolio and introducing new products in those areas, and that will be a good growth driver about or beyond, let’s say the normal growth of the Company going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Isaac Ro</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Amanda Murphy from William Blair. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey good morning guys, this actually Anthony, in for Amanda. Just a piggy back off of the VWR catalyst question asked earlier. I believe, in previous statements you guys have mentioned that it touches about 25% of your customer base. And it sounds like, as you mentioned you've had nice growth, is that 25% customer base assumption still intact or is that actually picked up a little bit?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>No. I mean it’s still a good number to think about, because it’s primarily the big pharma customers and some of the industrial customers that look for those kind of services. And so the revenue base -- the underlying revenue base is I think well described with a 25%. What we do see is an increase within that customer base using services. Does that make sense?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, thank you. And then if I could switch over to the [indiscernible]. Could you provide an update just overall how that relationship is still working and how well that's going?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we have a very solid relationship with some as a supplier. We continue to explore opportunities to actually expand the relationship by adding more product lines. Recently we added organics in the European business that we haven't been distributing in the past. So, I always look at this as a very solid supplier and distributor relationship.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Perfect. Could I just ask lastly, could you provide insight or just overall thoughts regarding the pending Sigma-Merck deal and any impact that that maybe having on the market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, they are close to finalizing the acquisition of sigma. I read that they have now received all the regulatory approvals. As you know they have to divest a piece in Europe specifically in order to close a deal, this is being negotiated right now and they expect to close that deal by the end of September.</p>
<p>I personally look forward to closure of that transaction because then we can actually start having discussions with our friends at Merck to expand our product range that we might distribute for them. There are some natural product lines that I think VWR could add a lot of value to the combination of Merck and Sigma, so we look forward to the date they can actually announce the closing of that deal.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the questions and congrats on the quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question is from Eric Percher from Barclays. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Percher</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. So, a question on big picture, the organic growth rate, you made clear 3% to 4%, but still the expectation, as we think about this quarter, how much of the 4.7% growth should we think of as aided by the timing element in Europe, and do you view that 4.7% as a bit of anomaly, I know you mentioned the 4.2% for the first half also very strong, I'd love to get your thoughts on organic growth.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I mean like we said, 3% to 4% is what we expecting mid to long term for the Company. There might always be some variance between individual quarter's, we had only 1.9% organic growth in EMEA-APAC in the first quarter, now we have 4.7%, some of it is obviously the shifts caused by the Easter effects that we blamed in Q1 for being below 3% to 4%.</p>
<p>So, some of it is just the seasonality if you think about it, between Q1 and Q2, but overall we expect to stay in this 3% to 4% organic revenue growth.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>So, Eric, if you look at the mid-year break here, EMEA-Asia Pac had organic growth 3.3%, so again to Manuel's comment, we're right basically in the middle of that range.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Percher</span></strong></p>
<p>Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Jonathan Groberg from UBS. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Groberg</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, just a quick question Greg on gross margin, our model came a little bit later than expected, can you speak into that a little bit again?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. There is basically three principle drivers here that works. So, year-over-year, quarter-over-quarter we are down 60 basis points, there is an article issue with respect to reclassification from SG&amp;A cost to cost of goods sold that is worth about 40 basis points, and that will last by the time we get to the first quarter of 2016, so there is 40 basis points of headwind there.</p>
<p>Our currency effects translation is impacting us for about 20 basis points. Then we have mixed effect from some of the growth that we've seen in biopharma and some of the tail spends that is coming through our channel. It creates a certain downward pressure as well, but that's essentially being offset by productivity gains and pricing, lower freight cost and private label growth.</p>
<p>So it's principally associated with the reclassification which is optical and then a little bit of FX pressure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Groberg</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. That is going to lead to my next question in terms of the pricing environment, overall then sounds like stable actually bit positive?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's very stable, no major change there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Groberg</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then last one, can you kind of just describe the - how you see the current M&amp;A environment for you guys?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>We have a very solid pipeline and so it's - we will continue with our strategy, deploying $50 million to $75 million per year on acquisitions, at the midpoint of the year we're slightly - we had $45 million, so I think we are very much on track on what we want to accomplish for this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Groberg</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Peter Lawson from Mizuho Securities. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Lawson</span></strong></p>
<p>Greg, just going back to the devaluation kind of Chinese exposure, what's the maximum impact that could be on the top and bottom line or is that lost in rounding and could that have any dock on effect for other parts of the business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Peter, it's lost in rounding.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Lawson</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Perfect, and then, just on - I may have missed this, but the additional cash flow that you may get from refinancing, is that all going to pay down debt?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, certainly we would expect that lower interest cost to increase our free cash flow available to invest in the business, but part of our capital allocation is natural deleveraging and we would see some of the proceeds going in that direction as well, Peter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Lawson</span></strong></p>
<p>Got you. And then, just finally as we look out for the rest of the year, is there anything unusual in seasonality or any calendar effects we should be thinking about?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>No. The calendar is behaving for the rest of the year, so billing days are comparable, there is always some variability in December associated with the holidays unlike but that's kind of normal and it happens every year, so nothing really anomalous to call at this point.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Lawson</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you so much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Dan Arias from Citigroup. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Arias</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, guys. Thank you. Just a follow up on the private label business, curious about the appetite from pharma there, I know historically they haven't been the primary audience for the lower price point portfolio, but just wondering if that's at all changed or could change going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Greg Cowan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It actually has changed. I mean historically pharma didn't entertain the idea of using private label products with the cost pressure they are under - they have certainly changed that strategy and so there is an increased interest in private label products, as long they are good quality products which is what we provide.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Arias</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. And then you highlighted Manuel your ERP advantages, can you just sort of compare where the infrastructure is in terms of being fully comprehensive in integrated in the Americas versus what you have in Europe, just trying to sort of understand how complete the build out is in U.S.?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>We are in sustained level in the meantime. It's basically - we took the best practices from Europe when deploying the SAP system in the Americas and basically all countries also in the Americas all are now on the SAP system, I think the only one missing is Mexico. But besides that, we have a very similar infrastructure and because we have one global IS team driving those systems, they develop them in parallel basically.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Arias</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from George Hill from Deutsche Bank. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, it's Steven on for George this morning. We're just wondering if there are any specific types of biopharma customers that are seeing greater strength than others like biotech versus large pharma?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>No. I wouldn't even be able to give you the differentiation here. I think we're seeing good growth on both sides of the equation.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just as a follow up to one of the earlier questions. At this point, what is the private label penetration biopharma, how does it compare to some of the other customer segment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>It's still a little lower than for the general customer population, but with an increasing trend.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Steve Willoughby from Cleveland Research. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Willoughby</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, thanks for taking my question. Most of my questions have been asked, but I do have two quick ones. I guess first, would you guys have any interest in the businesses that Sigma-Aldrich is looking to divest?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>We make no comments on acquisition activities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Willoughby</span></strong></p>
<p>That's okay. I just didn't know if it's a product line that you'd like to self manufacture yourself. My next question though is just regarding organic growth in the back half of the year, if my math is correct, it looks like you're maintaining your full year revenue guidance implies kind of more like 2% to 3% organic growth in the back half of the year, is that - is that what you're thinking and any reason for the slowdown, maybe it's just comps?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Manuel Brocke-Benz</span></strong></p>
<p>There will be some slowdown because of the more difficult comps. Bear in mind that, for example, in the Americas segment, we grew 7.4% in the fourth quarter of last year, so that makes it a little bit more difficult to pile on top of that. But in general we are very pleased with organic growth, the rate that we're in and we believe that 3% to 4% can be sustained also for the next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Willoughby</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And this time I'm showing no further questions. I'd like to turn the call back over to Mr. John Sweeney, for any closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>John Sweeney</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much for joining us today on our second quarter earnings conference call and we look forward to updating you as we move through the rest of the year. Have a good day.</p>
<p><strong>Manuel Brocke-Benz</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today's conference. This does conclude the program, and you now may disconnect. Everyone have a great day.</p>
