<p>At this time, I would like to turn the call over to Mr. Garone. Please go ahead, sir.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Garone </strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Kailey. Good morning everyone and thank you for joining us to discuss Emisphere’s financial results for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and other corporate highlights.</p>
<p>On today’s call Alan will discuss recent company highlights, then I will review financial results for the quarter. Following closing remarks, Alan; Peter Shaw; Carl Sailer and I will be available for the question-and-answers. I hope you’ve had an opportunity to review the second quarter financial results press release which was issued earlier this morning.</p>
<p>Before moving into the discussion of the second quarter results, please note that today’s remarks will contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties, including but not limited to statements regarding the success of the company’s commercialization initiatives and the sufficiency of the company’s cash position.</p>
<p>These risks and uncertainties are outlined in Emisphere’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including its quarterly report on Form 10-Q. As such, actual results may differ materially from what is discussed on today’s call. Please note that our earnings release, 10-Q and other SEC filings will be available on the Investor Relations page of our website at www.emisphere.com.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Alan Rubino.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much Mike and good morning to everyone. Maybe some of you have come in from the beach or your vacation to listen in and we appreciate that, but in all seriousness we thank you for joining the call. </p>
<p>First let’s talk about a discussion of the second quarter 2015 highlights. Eligen B12, the commercial rollout continues. The product revenues for the second quarter were $88,000. We saw some growth, but for sure it’s difficult to make a quarter-over-quarter comparison since it was only on the market for a very small portion of the first quarter. But while it’s still very early days, we are beginning to see trial use and adoption by our target physicians. </p>
<p>For those of you who might not have joined us on previous calls, might be new to the Eligen story, I think it’s worthwhile to give you a quick overview of Eligen B12. It is Emisphere’s first to market therapeutic product. It’s the first ever oral prescription B12 product that has been clinically proven to normalize B12 levels. The category previously included only injectables and nasal delivery formulations. </p>
<p>Eligen B12 has the potential to become the new standard of care for individuals with serious and [clinical] [ph] B12 deficiency. What’s in particular nice about this product is it a small once daily oral tablet, the size of a baby aspirin, but with a significant technology inside. It is indicated for the dietary management of patients who have a medically diagnosed Vitamin B12 deficiency and again of great importance it’s been clinically proven to be comparable to the B12 IM injection. </p>
<p>Another critical point, for those of you who are familiar with this disease state is that Eligen B12 works even in the absence of intrinsic factor. What is intrinsic factor? It is the protein made in the stomach that normally facilitates B12 absorption. So this is the first commercially available prescription product that uses our advanced Eligen Technology in a proprietary carrier, known as salcaprozate sodium or easier said SNAC. SNAC effectively chaperones the B12 molecule to the gastric lining into the bloodstream of the patient. </p>
<p>Let’s talk about B12 deficiency just to give perspective. It affects approximately 48 million people in the United States and I want to underscore the fact that medical B12 deficiency is a serious medical problem. It is significantly under diagnosed and undertreated. What makes it even more difficult to accept is that it’s highly preventable and we as a company intend to help change this reality through the approaches we are making though medical education and continuous communication we will talk about later. </p>
<p>An important point, if left untreated, B12 deficiency can cause irreversible damage to nerve cells and create other comorbidities from blood conditions through to CNS complications. Medical B12 deficiency can occur in a wide range of conditions, where there is an impaired capacity of specific patients to absorb Vitamin B12.</p>
<p>These include various anemias. Also people with irritable bowel syndrome and irritable bowel disease, patients with Chron’s disease and celiac disease and also a broader category just becoming better known to physicians is that patients that have been taking proton pump inhibitors and/or metformin medications on a continues basis, by design most of these patients will become B12 deficient and this needs to be addressed. </p>
<p>Now with the PPIs, these are commonly used to reduce stomach acid and address diabetes. So these valuable medications, because they work for what they are supposed to do, often create the consequence of inhabiting the body’s ability to absorb B12. </p>
<p>Eligen B12 has the ability to affect all these clinical factors, making Eligen B12 an ideal candidate to become a true potential first line treatment and possibly and our goal is to make it a new standard of care for B12 deficiency treatment. </p>
<p>Shifting gears to the Eligen B12 commercial strategy that is in progress, it is a comprehensive, it’s well integrated, it’s a multiphase commercialization strategy that we continue to roll out methodically across the United States. It includes professional promotion campaign that is designed to gain solid brand awareness, better understanding of the B12 deficiency in the patient types and then move to trial sampling and sustained usage of this product. We continue to execute effectively on our marketing plan and we are quite confident that we will continue to build traction over the next several quarters. </p>
<p>Business development is obviously a critical part of Emisphere’s turnaround and growth and on this front, as we have stated previously, we are currently engaged in multiple and direct ex-U.S. licensing discussions and we want to expand our business horizons as well as the whole B12 deficiency and treatment story outside of the United States. </p>
<p>We have the intention then of offering Oral B12 prescription for sale in global markets and while these, you hear this on a couple of calls and I’m sure everyone always wants to wait, when are the results coming, we feel good about these, but these take time and we will continue to update you on the progress of these on each of these calls. </p>
<p>Switching to Novo Nordisk is particular, it’s part of our business development discussion. Our partnership with them on our Eligen Technology continues to advance. Earlier this year, actually quite recently, Novo Nordisk reported positive Phase 2 data pertaining to the oral formulation of Semaglutide, which is a long acting human GLP-1 analog. </p>
<p>Novo Nordisk is developing this molecule as both a once weakly subcutaneous injection and also as a once daily oral administration for the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The oral formulation is a tablet using SNAC, which is Emisphere’s absorption enhancing incipient and for those of you who might not have picked it up, it’s also the same carrier that is used in the Eligen B12. </p>
<p>Based on the positive Phase 2 study results Nova Nordisk has announced, it will initiate or has initiated consultations with regulatory authorities, which I believe remain in progress. Subsequent to this action, they will make a decision on whether to progress this candidate into Phase 3 development and that possibility will be information that we will look forward to hearing sometime in the near future. </p>
<p>This news on these positive trials was very important to Emisphere. Under our GLP-1 license agreement with Nova Nordisk, we are eligible to receive additional contingent product development and sales milestone payments. Also we would be entitled to receive royalties in the event that Nova will commercialize disease products developed under this agreement. </p>
<p>Beyond Nova we are continuing to execute a comprehensive new carrier business development initiative to identify and secure new Eligen technology partnerships. Dr. Peter Shaw and our Lead Chemist here Dr. David Gschneidner have joined me in this approach. This is a more precise and targeted approached that we’ve had from the past and it is based on our learnings, our experience and also studying the market needs that has let us to a current focus of looking in a more micro way at next generations smaller portions and peptides, which appear to be some of the best matches with our carries. </p>
<p>We are also looking at Pegylated versions of the same type of molecules and we have a particular emphasis on and a bias towards looking at proven and/or approved drug compounds. The reason for that is these are better know to physicians and patients. They are de-risked and that the efficacy and as well as the safety components are all well know and better managed by physicians and patients through experience. And of course we still look at the development of new oral formulations to replace injectables beyond just the small molecules, and I mean the proteins and peptides and we also will continue to look at small molecules as we have been approached for some to look at.</p>
<p>At this point I’d like to transition this conversation back to Mike Garone and he will review with you the financial results for the second quarter of 2015 financial highlights. Thanks Mike. </p>
<p><strong>Michael Garone</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Alan. First I’ll provide an overview of financial results for the quarter. As Alan mentioned, revenue was $88,000 for the quarter compared to no revenue for the second quarter of 2014. All revenue during the quarter was generated from sales of Eligen B12. </p>
<p>Net income for the second quarter was $7.1 million or $0.12 per basic and negative $0.04 per diluted share. That compares to a net loss of $8.1 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year. The $7.1 million net income reported for the quarter was due primarily to $13.9 million decrease in the fair value of derivatives, offset partially by $4.6 million operating expense and $2.2 million interest expense. </p>
<p>Weighted average basic shares outstanding were approximately $60.7 million and approximately $123.4 million diluted shares at June 30, 2015. Total operating expenses for the second quarter were $4.6 million, that’s an increase of $3.1 million or 200% compared to the same period last year. The increase in operating expenses was due primarily to increased sales, marketing and other commercial costs in connection with the introduction of Eligen B12 in the U.S. in March of 2015.</p>
<p>Total operating expenses included R&amp;D costs of $59,000; that’s a decrease of $230,000 or 80% from last year and selling, general and administrative expenses of $4.5 million, that’s an increase of $3.3 million or 264% compared to the same period in 2014. That’s commensurate with the introduction of Oral Eligen B12 in the United States. </p>
<p>Next I’ll cover financial results for the first half. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $94,000 compared to no revenue for six month ended June 30, 2014. The increase in revenue was due to sales of Oral Eligen B12. For the six months ended June 30, 2015 Emisphere reported a net loss of $25.8 million or $0.43 per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of $11.4 million or $0.19 per basic and diluted share for the same period last year. </p>
<p>The $25.8 million net loss reported for the six months was due to a $12.5 million increase in the fair value of derivatives, $9.2 million of operating expenses and $4.1 million of interest expense. Weighted average basic and diluted shares outstanding for the periods ended June 30, 2015 and 2014 were 60,687,478 shares. </p>
<p>Total operating expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $9.2 million compared to $3.9 million for the same period last year; that’s an increase of $5.3 million or 138%. Total operating expenses included R&amp;D of $287,000 compared to $651,000 for the same period last year and SG&amp;A expenses of $9 million compared to $3.2 million for the same period last year. The increase in total operating expenses again is due primarily to increased sales, marketing and other commercial costs in connection with the introduction of Eligen B12.</p>
<p>Finally I’ll talk about liquidity. As of June 30, 2015 we had approximately $3.2 million in cash. On July 1, 2015 we borrowed the final $2 million, an original principal amount on our $20 million secured credit facility with MHR Fund Management. The cash is being used to advance the commercialization of the company’s first commercial product Eligen B12. The company has now borrowed the full $20 million available under the loan facility. The loan will mature on December 31, 2019 and bears interest at a rate of 13% per annum. </p>
<p>We believe that the funding made available through the loan agreement, assuming attainment of performance milestones the company will have sufficient capital to support commercial sales and marketing of Eligen B12 in the United States and to continue operations through approximately the end of 2015. </p>
<p>The company’s future capital requirements beyond 2015 and its financial success overall depend largely on the commercial success of our oral Eligen B12 prescription product, and the company’s ability to leverage existing partnerships and secure new partnering opportunities.</p>
<p>That’s it for the financials. And now I’d like to turn the call back over to Alan for some closing remarks. Alan.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rubino </strong></p>
<p>Mike, thank you very much. So during the second quarter 2015 Emisphere continued to advance upon the commercial rollout of Eligen B12 in the U.S. As mentioned before, again this is the first marketed product using the advanced Eligen Technology that’s been around for 30 years and now it on the market in function, that’s very important. </p>
<p>The March launch of Eligen B12 was really a transformation and I don’t use the word lightly, a transformational milestone for Emisphere and was a huge achievement by its partnership to review the shareholders and the people internally here. To scale up to commercial manufacturing to building commercial capabilities to get this product launched. I am most proud of this as is the team.</p>
<p>Even more importantly, we’re in the business of pharmaceuticals and patient care, so the Eligen B12 being available can now benefit the many existing patients and future patients. Some of them are already receiving IM injections and they have been waiting for an effective oral prescription alternative to treat their B12 deficiency and others have a lot of serious diseases as I mentioned; in the GI area in particular that may not be receiving any therapy or treatment, which is part of our goal of the expansion.</p>
<p>Also as mentioned in previous calls and again today, we continue to be engaged in these multiple discussions with ex-U.S. opportunities with the intention of offering oral Eligen B12 Rx for sale in global markets. </p>
<p>So looking ahead, our efforts will remain focused on continuing to maximize the U.S. roll out and in doing that, growing physician adoption and expanding patient new starts, whether they be IM conversions or addressing patients with new B12 deficiency in other disease states. Securing those ex-U.S. partnerships again is a 24x7 initiative as well and of course we are doing all this ultimately to realize Eligen B12’s full market potential.</p>
<p>I don’t want to mislead anyone on the call. There’s a lot of hard work that’s led up to this and there’s still a lot of hard work ahead, but it’s a good kind of hard work. I am confident that we can achieve commercial success and we look forward to achieving this in the months and quarters ahead.</p>
<p>Beyond Eligen B12, we will continue to push ahead on these global business development efforts and work towards partnerships around our technology. So we have not forgotten our carrier business that we have been so effectively expanding with our Novo Nordisk partnership in particular and others that we’re in expanded discussions with.</p>
<p>We are laser focused on achieving our objectives and maintaining the key company transition and the momentum that we have created in 2015. We look forward to updating you with even more details and more depth in our progress on our future calls.</p>
<p>And now I’d like to turn this back over to Kailey who is our operator.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mads Rosendal with Danske Bank. Your line is now opened. If your phone is on mute, please un-mute.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mads Rosendal</strong></p>
<p>Hello. Just wanted to hear regarding the GLP-1 corporation you have with Novo. I think many expected Novo to make an announcement on their Q2 reports, but they actually didn’t mention the drug. Could you give some more color on this if possible?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Yes, hi Mads, thanks for the question. I would imagine, that was one on a lot of people’s minds. I would never attempt to speak for a great partner like Novo Nordisk. I believe that it’s their responsibility and they would be the lead on announcing any information. </p>
<p>I think what people are guided by, and that would include us, is that they’ve had excellent success with the multiple Phase 2 studies and that any perspective that I could read and I read a lot of the same materials that you do in a public domain, they are very positive about this technology and very positive about their results. So I am anticipating over time that Novo will make some announcement. </p>
<p>But as my understanding has been, previously that obviously they were very pleased with the results and the next step for them was having discussions with the various regulatory authorities which have been taking place. So I would imagine – and if you deal with regulatory authorities, sometimes the timing of having those meetings and getting final resolution could be a great limiting step for them, but that’s speculation on my part. </p>
<p>But overall, I think we still feel good about the whole situation with the GLP-1 and our carrier and Novo’s future in that area, but again these are just my personal comments. I have no official information that I could share other than that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mads Rosendal</strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for the question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mads Rosendal</strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Brad Josh [ph]. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so I have one about the Novo partnership and then a few about B12. So first of all on the Novo partnership, can you clarify if Emisphere is eligible for a Phase 3 milestone payment should Novo move ahead with the GLP-1 Phase 3?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Garone</strong></p>
<p>Hey Brad, this is Mike Garone. Actually we announced a couple of years ago that that was one of the milestones that was prepaid when we received $10 million I believe at the end of 2013. We are entitled to future development and sales milestones, although those amounts have not been disclosed, they are confidential. So did that answer that question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. Okay, so then regarding B12, so far what has been the biggest factor in driving sales and doctor acceptance rates or just some patient acceptance issues as well and kind of related to that, is there any information that you can give us about refill or dropout rates. And then my final question about B12 is can you give us any preview or color as to what you’re seeing or have seen in July?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Okay, Brad hi. This is Alan and I also have Carl here and he can comment as well. It was a series of questions there, but I think by and large we are quite pleased with the early reception of the product and in particular as you know, because this company is pivoted to become a commercial organization, we put representatives out there in defined territories and in those territories their goal in their early months was to develop first relationships with the doctors and that has happened quite effectively and what’s more important is that we are following the normal procedure I’d quote almost so the norm of the awareness use in trial of a physician with almost any new product and it’s also been a very successful experience, but it takes time. </p>
<p>The patient comes in, doctors are creatures of habit and they will not wholesale change people over. They need to experiment themselves, see results for themselves and so the patient comes in, they will either check the patient’s blood or if they are already on a IM injection, they will switch them over to Eligen B12 and it’s another five to six weeks before they bring them back to determine if they have met certainly their goals for that particular patient. I think the great news on that is the fact that we have had just outstanding conversations back from physicians that have utilized this product in even the most difficult cases. </p>
<p>To-date, you asked through July, but actually through August where we’ve had trial and getting feedback, we have been particularly pleased that we have not heard of any case yet where the patient has not achieved the goals that the doctor was looking for and that’s very important, because before you get to sort of the great business and the build of the product, you have to get the credibility in the minds of the physicians and the patients and that has been occurring nicely. And I’ll ask Carl if he has any additional comments or Peter Shaw, because they are both here with me.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carl Sailer</strong></p>
<p>I’ll just add just to reinforce. We are in that – as Alan said, that early adoption period where doctors are trying to [pace] [ph] the product out waiting for patients to come back, to get their blood levels tested before they more consistently shift some of their other IM patients onto the product. I can share, demand has increased consistently on a weekly basis throughout this previous week and to your question on refills, refills also are starting to increase nicely over the more recent period. So it’s still early, but we’re certainly tracking and then the trend is moving in the right direction.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Brad, does that answer your question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s great. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>A - Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of Henry Bishop. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Hello. Just a question on thoughts of additional Eligen B12 formulations based on patient preferences. Any thoughts by the company to move forward with different formulations just based on patient preferences, because there is more than a few different variations of the B12 formulation.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Henry, let me comment and I’d also like to have Dr. Shaw comment on that as well. The simple answer is we are extremely interested in new formulations with the product. From a business perspective you should know that the patent that goes out to 2028 I believe on the Eligen B12 and for that we also have the opportunity to add other components, whether it be folate or iron on top of that. And what we are doing right now under the leadership of Dr. Shaw with the team internally is trying to determine – certainly the patient interest, but more importantly the clinical need as to what would be the very specific components that we would add to it and for which type of treatments and which type of patients. </p>
<p>So we feel we can do that very effectively, but we want to have a laser focus as to what we bring out, because we want to make sure that we’re addressing needs and also we want to establish the B12 product first on its own and then develop the tributaries of other areas, whether it be iron or folate and Peter you might have some comments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Shaw</strong></p>
<p>Yes, in addition to what Alan just said, there are a number of patient groups that would benefit from a B12 combination therapy; particularly a group that we were looking at at the moment is those patients who have undergone bariatric surgery. There’s around 200,000 people a year having bariatric surgery in the United States and every single one of those requires both vitamin and mineral supplements subsequent to surgery. </p>
<p>We know for a fact that Eligen B12 works as effectively in people who’ve had their stomach removed or bypassed as it does in people who have an intact stomach. So Eligen B12 is the perfect B12 supplement for these patients.</p>
<p>In addition to that, we are looking at ways we could maybe combine Eligen B12 with other minerals and supplements as a specific replacement therapy if the patient is undergoing bariatric surgery and that’s in addition to the ones that Alan’s already mentioned with regard to folic acid, iron and other minerals. We know well that certainly metals and other small molecules are perfect for the Eligen carrier technology, so we are actively pursuing these and other opportunities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>So Henry, as you heard, I mean again I want to restate it’s so important that the Eligen B12, the molecule that we just launched is out there. It established itself as it’s doing and Carl pointed that out as I did and we’re seeing excellent clinical results from the program and you always want to do that beyond your clinical trials when you get out into the broad audience. So as that gets established and the credibility and the comfort level of physicians to prescribe and of course the patients really do enjoy not getting an injection. </p>
<p>As that’s happening in parallel, the programs that Peter just outlined are being obviously, seriously not only embedded, but prioritized, so that we can develop – we would like to develop as much as we can from an internal portfolio off of this platform if possible. So at this point you pretty much are updated as to where we are in that realm.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay, great, thanks. Just a quick follow-up on the B12 itself. There’s more than a few variations I believe. The offering from Emisphere is cyanocobalamin, but there are other B12 structures and it appears some patients may prefer others, some prefer the cyano, some prefer the methyl or the hydrox formulation. So just a pure B12 structure, is there any direction or thoughts by the company to offer additional B12 product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>We are pleased for you to ask that question, because that has also come out on occasion from physicians and our representative as well as just random calls and I think Dr. Shaw is quite adept at approaching this thing. He will comment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Shaw</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. It’s a very interesting question that I’m posed almost daily by both our sales team and also physicians and other clinicians out in the field. The first question that we always get asked is about methylcobalamin and it has an increasing popularity and the reasons for it are very spurious and often not down clinical foundations. </p>
<p>As you may be aware there are two active metabolites to cobalamin that the human body requires, one is adenosylcobalamin and one is methylcobalamin. So just giving one of those active metabolites in the form of methylcobalamin doesn’t actually solve the problems that patents have when they have a B12 deficiency. You actually need both and there is no evidence that methylcobalamin is converted to adenosylcobalamin within the human tissues, so people do require both. </p>
<p>Around the world hydroxycobaiamin is probably the most widely used, whereas in the United States cyanocobalamin is the treatment of preference. So there are a number of reasons for that. Firstly, it’s a bit cheaper to produce. The other sort of counter argument to methylcobalamin is it is extremely light sensitive as a product. So especially when it’s given as a sublingual liquid or as an injection, unless it is being kept in complete darkness from the time it was manufactured to the time the patient gets it, then will it bring some degradation. </p>
<p>There is also an increasing popularity for giving these preparations in a buckle or under the tongue preparation. Again, you do get some absorption that way, but the molecule actually is really too large to be absorbed that way. So you will get maybe 1% to 2% absorption of them in that way. So where as we see the arguments for producing maybe an alternative to cyanocobalamin. The clinical evidence doesn’t really back that up as a viable proposition at this time. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Also Peter is it safe to say that the 30 million to 35 million injections currently given in the United Sates are cyanocobalamin for the vast majority? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Shaw</strong></p>
<p>The vast majority in this country of cyanocobalamin is a small following for hydroxycobaiamin which is actually a more expensive one. The advantage is has a greater bio availability and less is lost after a dose. So maybe you could give it three months around the world, rather than monthly. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Okay Hendry, thank you for your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. That was very informative. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Robert Brennan [ph]. Your line is now open. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Hi guys, thanks for taking the call. I have a question for you; in terms of the initial update of the B12, I understand its new and all that stuff, but at this point it’s tracking at less than $400,000 a year which doesn’t pay the bill. So by the end of the year do you guys foresee having to go to the capital markets or because liquidity is obviously unfortunately once again a pressing issue for you guys. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Yes well, first of all I think we do have to allow the market to respond. I mean you at least think six months or more on the market, even when you have an established sales field with relationships Robert as you probably know that. But as Carl pointed out, we are quite pleased with the trends and we have been looking at some other kinds of reference points and looking at launches of products, independent necessarily of the therapeutic category that we’re in or may have even larger field forces, different therapeutic categories and we are quite pleased with the relative productivity of our filed force and the acceptance. </p>
<p>Also as we’ve launched, you know we launched in March, which was pretty much a market development month. We get the product in the pharmacies, you establish the relationships and then so we really haven’t had more than 100 days with our field force on the market and we’ve been pleased to see what the uptick and of course you got to look at the summer months being in there as well, which is an interesting dynamic. A lot of patient visits, a lot of the world has its lowest number of visits during those months and yet we’ve done nicely doing them. </p>
<p>So we are really looking forward to the fourth quarter, because in order for us to establish a real platform for projection is you really need a basis of time on the market and so between now and the end of the year we’ll see how that will pickup and Mike I think would like to comment on the whole capital market discussion and how we are looking at it right now. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Garone</strong></p>
<p>At the risk of repeating some of what Alan just said, let me just reinforce that we have really seen consistent launch performance so far with Eligen B12. Technically as Carl and Peter mentioned, the product is performing flawlessly. Physicians acceptance is picking up, product sales are picking up. We really need a little bit more time to see how we are doing. </p>
<p>That being said, our focus on financing for the year has really been and is going to be, it’s going to continue to be, to seek and secure non-diluted funding and that’s going to start with improving B12 commercial sales, seeking and securing new BD initiatives with existing and potentially new partners. Naturally if circumstances require that we need to consider a capital markets financing. We’ve got a big group or grounds full of supportive investors. </p>
<p>But again, that’s not the plan of action Rob. We’re really going to be focused on trying to get the non-dilutive funding first. So we’ll see how that works. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>All right, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from the line of William Fox. Your line is now open. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Fox </strong></p>
<p>Thanks. My question that I was going to ask was just answered by the previous question. So you can move to the next.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Alan Rubino</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Fox. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And I’m showing no further questions at this time. I’d like to turn the call back to Mr. Garone and Mr. Rubino for closing remarks. </p>
<p><strong>Alan Rubino </strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you Kailey very much. And again, as always I want to thank those of you who take the time to come of these calls and I also want to thank all of the investors that continue to have stayed with this company through a lot of its twist and turns, but I believe we are continuing to show a far better foundation for growth for the further and a consistency in both the carrier side and we are – we remain here and kind of extremely enthusiastic about the carrier repositioning as well as the Eligen B12 story. </p>
<p>So those of you who have experience in a market palace know I’ve launched over 35 drugs. You get surprises right away early on and your greatest concern is usually surprises around efficacy or safety of your product. And what’s really nice here is we have not had that at all. It appears to be a matter of time and reach and adoption and utilization, but we do not see barriers to that continuing. So we are very pleased, so thank you for your ongoing support and confidence in this new team and this sort of new version of this Emisphere Corporation. </p>
<p>So I don’t have any other remarks to add and I don’t know Mike if you have anything else? </p>
<p><strong>Michael Garone</strong></p>
<p>I don’t.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Rubino </strong></p>
<p>So if not, again we look forward to the next call and maybe provide you even more depth and about information on not only Eligen but other business development highlights. So thanks much and have a great day folks. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude the program and you may all disconnect. Everyone have a wonderful day.</p>
