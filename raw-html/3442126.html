<p><strong>Ivan Donaldson</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you everyone for coming to Micron’s 2015 Summer Analyst Day. Both those of you that are here in person as well as the webcast. I think it will be a great day for everyone. Our CEO Mark Durcan will kick it off followed by Mark Adams our President; Scott DeBoer, our VP of R&amp;D; and then Ernie Maddock, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>Just so everybody knows, we are going save Q&amp;A for the end. So, you may want to take notes as we go through in terms of what questions you want to ask. And at the very end, we will bring all the speakers back up for Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>So that, I’ll turn it over to Mr. Mark Durcan.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Durcan </strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Ivan. Good morning everyone and thank you for coming. It’s great pleasure to see so many old familiar faces in the room today. I think we have a pretty good presentation put together for you. It should answer a lot of the questions you have about the company and our focus on a go forward basis. But as Ivan just mentioned, in the event we missed anything that’s important for you or that we need to cover, we’ve set aside plenty of time at the end for questions and answers. And as we move through the agenda, we will try and present material in a free flow fashion and then come back at the end and answer those questions.</p>
<p>I’ll kick off with a few views on where we are from an industry environment perspective and given that how Micron plans to focus and execute over the next 18 months to 2 years, spend a little bit of time on some key strategic imperatives for us and what we really focus on executing.</p>
<p>Mark Adams will then join with a lot more detail around how we are interacting with our customers. What are the markets that we’re going after and the products that we’re going to bring to market and how we plan to grow the business over the next couple of years.</p>
<p>Scott DeBoer will talk about the technology roadmap, the innovations we’re driving at Micron and how that fuels, not only the product roadmap but our ability to build a new value for the customers.</p>
<p>And finally, hopefully many of you already know Ernie Maddock from his previous jobs and career. Those of you that didn’t know previously, hopefully have met him at this point. But he will come up last and talk about the financial strategy of the company, a little bit more about capital allocation and how we plan on providing information to our investors on a go-forward basis as well as how we plan on managing the company. And then again, I’ll come back at the end to talk about Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>I thought it would be -- to start-off today, with a view of last couple of cycles, last three cycles in the semiconductor industry. And it’s not because I want to convince you where we might be in any peculiar cycle or what’s the magnitude of any cycle might be, but just to show you the trend because we are navigating, I think what many people think are challenging circumstances at the moment but there is a lot that’s positive when we actually look at the date in terms of what’s happening in the memory industry.</p>
<p>So if we go back before the financial crisis in 2008, you can see what was a pretty severe semiconductor cycle, down roughly 25%, negative growth at the bottom of the cycle, and even more severe memory cycle with a strong kick back following the end of the crisis. And this cycle is actually probably shorter attenuated in terms of its period given the interruption of the financial crisis and what was going on in the global economy but probably more typical in terms of what a semiconductor cycle looks like, if you go back to the previous cycles prior to that.</p>
<p>If you look at what’s happened since then – L shaped cycle that followed the financial crisis, so, what I’m plotting here is peak quarter-over-quarter growth to the quarter before, the next peak.</p>
<p>So, what we are looking at here is peak quarterly -- quarter-over-quarter growth in the semiconductor industry in the dotted lines and the solid line showing what’s going on the memory industry. And you can see that next cycle had a big snapback for memory obviously very strong cycle at the beginning and then a long -- what we think of really is sort of an L shaped recovery, not the big upside at the end of the cycle, but not the big downsides that we’ve seen in some previous cycles.</p>
<p>And then when you look at what’s happened since then, you see this continued protracted L recovery really, a little bit of a minimal peak there in memory market, up 30% quarter-over-quarter at the peak and in middle of 2013, but really then ongoing really ripple sort of performance. And I think what you’re seeing here -- the reason I show you this is not to say where are we in the cycle but to show you that really now we’ve had a long period of relative muted volatility in the memory market and a long period of relative outperformance for the memory business.</p>
<p>So when we think about what is going on in the memory business today, yes, we’re seeing price declines given the historic underperformance of the PC segment over the last number of quarters. And I think it really caught a number of us by surprise, but not a cataclysmic cycle.</p>
<p>And this is a slide now that I think is familiar to many of you but I think it is supported by what I just showed you, which is that the memory industry really has changed; it’s in the data, it’s in the cycle and there is real reason for it. You can actually see the detail when we look at the detail of those cycle slides. So first of all, consolidated suppliers. We all have sufficient scale. We’re really kind of in an environment where the suppliers in the marketplace appear to be investing for return on the invested capital.</p>
<p>And if you look at the kind of the ripples that you saw in that last cycle, you don’t see these big swings in terms of supply, wafer supply in the marketplace. What you see is ramification of small perturbations in the demand cycle. So, you got low supply growth; limited new wafer capacity coming online, I’ll show you some more data on that here in a little bit; and the slowing technology migrations to come with the slowing of Moore’s law, really driving situation where the incumbents in the market have to intentionally add wafers in order to grow supply faster than demand.</p>
<p>And finally, I think as maybe the least appreciated change that’s gone in the memory industry which is the rapid diversification of the end markets we serve and the differentiated products going into those end markets, really creating the situation where memory suppliers today have a lot more opportunities to differentiate their products, a lot more opportunity to add value for end customers whether it’s through component differentiated functionality or through system level performance. But that broadening of the market and the ability to target those markets I think over time lead to a memory industry that looks a lot more like the dotted lines in those previous slides, a much more like the semiconductor industry overall, but with the enhanced growth that you’ve seen over the last couple of years.</p>
<p>So, what does that look like for the DRAM today? When we think about what’s going on in DRAM supply, our view now is that 2015, big growth will come in right around 25%. We’re not through the year yet, so that could still move up or down a small amount, but I think that the die is pretty well cast, that’s about what we’re going to see. And on a go forward basis, as we look at what do we think is happening in the marketplace for 2016, we think it’s going to be about the same. We’re projecting 24%. And that we believe while a little bit too much in 2015 is probably just fine given any sort of normal market on a go forward basis.</p>
<p>And on the right side of the graph here what you see is this diversification of end demand, as I mentioned before. We’ve got continued shrinking of the most commoditized client segment of the market, continued growth in mobile which provides opportunity to differentiate and add system value, differentiated form factors and an enterprise where we can really drive value added performance and differentiation. And finally in the embedded market, it’s not growing as a percent of the total, but still growing with the market in areas like automotive, medical, industrial and providing large opportunities for value added products as well.</p>
<p>Switching to NAND, it’s a very similar picture. The numbers are coming from a higher high and saturating at about 35% on a go forward basis. So, really in order to maintain that we’re going to need additional wafers into the industry going forward. One of the dynamics that’s different in the NAND market today than in the DRAM market is we have this additional effect which is not only the slowing of technology migration, but for many of the competitors in the industry, we’re starting to see a saturation in terms of the conversion of MLC to TLC. And as that happened, it will take big growth out of the marketplace.</p>
<p>So with Samsung running maybe roughly 70% TLC today, their ability to drive more bits just like by shifting applications from MLC to TLC will diminish, that’s just slowed the growth of supply in the marketplace. Similarly for SanDisk at 50% et cetera. For Micron, we’re further back on that curve, but Micron today does have TLC components into the marketplace where we have more headroom to grow that piece of our business on a go forward basis.</p>
<p>And again on the right hand side, looking at the diversification, you see a continued shrinking of the consumer and renewable section of the market, but very robust growth in both mobile and SSDs. And the nice thing about the NAND market is the elasticity of this demand. So, as we think about some of the new technologies that are coming to market, we believe there will be the opportunity to grow the market as we grow supply, given some of the technologies that are coming to enable potentially lower price points.</p>
<p>Given all of that and what we’ve seen historically which is steady growth on real terms of the memory industry whether it’s DRAM or NAND, we feel pretty good about continuing to invest through these cycles. So, as we think about what does Micron need to do to participate in the memory market, we believe that there is continued growth ahead. We believe that the products we are providing to our customers will be able to add differentiated value, we believe we’ll be able to put them into differentiated markets and over time, generate real return on the invested capital that we’re bringing to the marketplace. And we’ll talk more about what some of those investments are as we go through the presentation today.</p>
<p>One thing that’s changed dramatically is how that supply is coming to the market and how it is meeting end-market demand. So, if you look now at in the blue line, the growth of memory as a percent of total semiconductor market, you can see that yes, it’s cyclical also and then it’s continuing to grow through the years. But that is grown for different reasons. If you go back 10 years into the mid-2000s, you can see that that growth was being driven by dramatic surge in wafer capacity. And that was new entrants at the time and a transition with incumbents bringing new 300-millimeter capacity in the marketplace, driving a rapid expansion in wafer supply and the memory industry.</p>
<p>We have a very different dynamic today with consolidated suppliers. And what happens when we have that dramatic increase in wafer supply because we didn’t get paid for the extra bits we were providing to the industry. And you can see these two curves directly actually anti-correlated. If you flash forward now to what’s going on in 2014 and 2015 since we’ve had with significant consolidation we’ve had because you don’t see that growth anymore. And the result is in fact you see a shrinking as new technologies take wafers out of the market on a relative basis. And what you see there is continued growth in the -- continued outperformance in memory relative to the semiconductor industry as we get paid for the incremental bits we’re providing.</p>
<p>So overall, we believe that this trend is more likely to continue rather than less likely continue and gives us additional confidence in the investments we need to make.</p>
<p>What are we focused on for 2015 and 2016? It’s pretty simple. It’s about investment in technology to drive new products and manufacturing efficiencies. It’s about continuing to invest in our capabilities to deliver advanced products, new technologies and system level functionality to drive value added solutions. And it’s about drawing our customer relationships and our partnerships.</p>
<p>If you think about Micron today, we are really the most global memory manufacturer by far. We have great relationships with customers all over the world because we don’t compete with our customers and we’re there with technical resources close to them. And we really have the ability to drive differentiated solutions and deeper relationships to drive these value added solutions into the future.</p>
<p>So, in 2015 and 2016, it’s about execution. We’re going to execute on our 20-nanometer DRAM ramp. You’ll hear more from Scott and Mark about that. We’ve got 16-nanometer TLC NAND in the memory in the market today. On a component level we need to ramp our solutions, our TLC, SSD based on that technology over the next couple of quarters and beyond. And we need to make sure we execute on what’s a really exciting new technology and differentiated from our competitors with our floating gate 3D NAND solutions.</p>
<p>We need to continue to create these new technologies like the 3D XPoint that we’ve introduced a couple of weeks ago and Scott will talk about some of the new ones we have in the pipeline that we believe will also position Micron very well for the future. And we need to continue to grow our system level capability and you will hear more about that from Mark Adams.</p>
<p>And finally, this piece about investing in our customer relationships and our partnerships is very, very real. We have great partnerships; many of you know about some of them, some of them are not so visible yet to you. But these partnerships I think are critical to growing in the complicated markets and in the markets that require customer intimacy we believe for the future.</p>
<p>So, I am going to just stop right here, turn it over to Mark Adams but just leave you with the thought process that notwithstanding the challenging times right now, we have a very strong plan; we have a lot of room to grow and improve; and we’re very, very focused on doing that. And you’re going to hear a lot more about that over the next couple of hours and I’ll come back to take your questions.</p>
<p>So, let me turn it over to Mark Adams.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Adams</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Mark. We probably should have done this upfront, but for those of you in the room, we’re very apologetic for the setting that we are in today. So sorry about the views and the windows and hope they are not too much of a distraction.</p>
<p>And as Mark talked about, it’s a very exciting time for our company when we think about the long term opportunities. But I’m going to start with a little bit of a setup for how we see the markets today. No shock to anybody that we’re dealing with some softness, obviously in the PC market. That was a catalyst for some of the turbulence in the DRAM business. When we think about broader market conditions, we think there are some really good pockets of the end demand and there’s this PC driven dynamic in primarily DRAM today, but we’re watching obviously the broader market. But it’s also an important point to know that other markets are doing quite well.</p>
<p>Mobile, networking, automotive, the server market still doing pretty well and that’s an important point to distinguish today as we think about our business. On the NAND side, there is still tremendous growth. We’ve said all along that NAND over the long-term because of this growth opportunity, probably is a little bit more turbulent, but, notwithstanding that, it’s exciting growth and then I think we’ve demonstrated that already with the success we’ve had in mobile NAND as well as our growth in SSDs. So, yes, we’ve seen softness in PC and it certainly had an impact on PC pricing but the message is that there are other aspects of our business that are doing quite well.</p>
<p>And I talked a little bit with some of you list night to think about this. We all feel at Micron a sense of urgency in a cycle, you saw Mark’s slide, in a cycle. And while I can’t share with you anything about current quarter results or any of that stuff, just go back 90 days to what we reported margins that you saw. So, if that’s the new low, if that’s the bottom of the trough, that’s the new memory business. So, then you say okay, great, Mark. Why? And I would suggest to you that the diversification aspect that Mark talked about in terms of end markets is the really primary driver for why the memory business is different today and will be more different in the future and I’d like to talk about that little bit.</p>
<p>If you went back to this meeting five years ago, we may have shown a slide that showed an aspirational state of where we wanted end market demand to be. We may have shown you that all these markets that are not material today were going to be five years ago. Well, as a matter of fact that’s our business today, networking is a big part of our business; automotive is a big part of our business; mobile is a huge part of our business; servers, data center, cloud, huge part of our business. We’re no longer a PC memory and PC DRAM company. And this diversification on the DRAM side is mirrored on the NAND side, even though NAND is a relatively newer technology segment. The products in NAND continue to diversify as well.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, five years ago, it was mostly MP3, USB, photography. Today, solid-state, automotive, mobile tremendous growth and continued diversification. And here’s the interesting thing. We forget, we talk about DRAM and say well, DRAM is only going to grow 25%. And I’m not an economics expert, but 25% growth is 25% growth. I imagine, there’s some people in the PC business that would think 25% growth is pretty freaking good. So, as I think about our business, need DRAM and NAND and the growth will continue to diversify, that is why we are so bullish on the long-term opportunity for Micron.</p>
<p>What I thought I’d do because this chart is nice and it starts the discussion. What I thought I’d do I’d take a couple of a few cases of how this shift has happened at Micron and how it’s impacted our business and by the way to go back and substantiate, why margins that we reported 90 days ago, I think somewhere in the 30% range, right, why it’s different? Let me show you why it’s different rather than try to convince you with one slide.</p>
<p>I don’t know, there’s been a technology that shifted our lifestyle more and the consumers’ than the mobile phone. Let’s just start the fact that I get less kid time because my kids are walking around with these devices playing games, basically 24 hours a day. And then think about all the video, all the photos. I came in and people were taking pictures of the Golden Gate Bridge this morning, this beautiful view and then what do they do? They upload these pictures to social media, [indiscernible] access to other applications, being able to check your home security system from a device like that, how we communicate, we all travel, right, going back home, communicating over applications allow you to video chat with somebody. The level of applications that’s driving these devices to be so critical in our everyday life, go back and think in terms of product development and our engagement with our customers, none of that happens without memory. And it’s not a commodity memory that they just go buy on the street. In mobile, our mix and our portfolio is a huge asset. NAND, DRAM, how we integrate those products in the packaged solutions, different power consumptions, different performance, capabilities all working with products that are designed for one customer, one customer’s requirement, one customer’s need.</p>
<p>So, as we think about the mobile case study for us, we are not just selling a commodity product to a group of customers. Each one of our customers is defining how Micron and how we can work together and collaborate to provide unique solutions to them, so that they can direct their products to a certain customer set. This segmentation and this product development initiative is why our mobile business unit is the top performing business unit at Micron. And we couldn’t say that three years ago. As a matter of fact, it was our worst performing business unit three years ago. Today our mobile business because of this type of engagement model is providing tremendous opportunities, again portfolio, mix, capabilities beyond silicon, firmware controllers, packaging, provide us an amazing opportunity. And here is the thing with mobile, we’re just starting, these devices will become more and more integrated into how we live our lives on a daily basis.</p>
<p>Another example, probably one that’s more changing in our lives today. I hesitate to ask the question, so I won’t but I took the Tesla [indiscernible]; I live here in the Bay and it’s hard to miss things. As a matter of fact when I pulled up downstairs yesterday, they said, would you like us to charge your car while you’re at your meeting? And of course they used my smartphone to make sure they’re charging my car, I don’t know if they are going to bill me; if they’re going to bill me hopefully Durcan will approve the expense statement but that’s another story. But you think about the automobile experience. Okay, first thing, my kid gets in and goes, look at the screen, the display on this thing is bigger than any PC I’ve ever had in my life.</p>
<p>Then the applications set in front of you, first of all there is diagnostics; there is also energy consumption model; there’s all this information; there is navigation; there is media; of course in this specific model I can go surf the Internet, certainly we do not when I’m driving but the option is there. They’re smart enough to turn off the video function. But the automotive experience today is incredible and that’s way on the early curve. Companies like Tesla and other companies are innovating self-driving cars and software that you are downloading to let you know that if you’ve changed -- I’ve never done this, but if you don’t put your blinker out, it will come back and tell you get back over in the other lane. So, the information and entertainment value of what’s going on inside of automotive, the safety, all the sensors, it’s incredible, none of it happens without memory. You can’t do it.</p>
<p>Same thing for us. We have [indiscernible]. Remember the DRAM company from 15 years ago, [indiscernible] customers that define products that work with customers, hey, fit me next quarter. Five years down the road, I’d like this function, how can you help me get there. That’s powerful; that’s the shift in our business. When we think about the portfolio there, it’s amazing. Again, products for one customer that we define together integrated. Automotive SSD, think about that; packaged material, a NAND in a DRAM package with a specific controller with firmware customized for that customer, again a very unique opportunity for us and we do as well. It’s one of the reasons why we’re the number one supplier of memory products to the automotive industry.</p>
<p>Perhaps one that’s a little bit less consumer obvious but I would argue is the most radical in terms of change right now is value for us in terms of cloud in the enterprise. Clearly, the phone is cool, the car is cool and that’s really fun to do that for our lives and transfer ourselves and talk and game and all that stuff. But the infrastructure to make that happen is probably in a more dynamic change than the prior two.</p>
<p>First, when you think about compute, the abilities today for memory to play a role is changing how companies leverage their computer architecture is unprecedented in terms of computing. And if you think about the opportunity for us to react to things like big data that in memory database applications, pattern recognition to name a few opportunity for us in this segment in terms of computing. We now are defining new architectures and we’re defining new products that again are not silicon but architecturally thinking the way people do compute and use compute power. When you think about even the products we’re shipping today Hybrid Memory Cube, where we redefine how close we can get to the processor and packaging in the overall architecture to provide the throughput that memory can help make compute more efficient and more powerful. That’s a powerful story for us.</p>
<p>And going forward beyond our leverage and our strength in this business, innovation around packaging; innovation around software and architectural improvement to get us closer and drive performance in overall throughput and working with the CPU and processing and power is a critical opportunity for us to take the leverage as we think that’s going to change the way computing is done in future.</p>
<p>Beyond that when we think about storage, it’s kind of got two issues going here. It’s got people just massively storing everything. I talked earlier about our behavior, uploading all these pictures to social media. If you go to Google or you go to YouTube, I am just amazed, you just look at anything and there’s video on them stored somewhere. And this massive amount of storage did increase in our industry. It’s calling for new ways, new methodologies and sourcing.</p>
<p>And the backdrop of all of this is the advancement and solid state technology and that is I’ll stop short of saying fully replacement mechanical but certainly making a dramatic impact on how people are thinking about storage architecture for the future. And the growth of the solid state market both in client and enterprise while early is just stagnant. But not only are there going to be more bits to be stored, there are going to more bits to be stored on our technology. And you can’t do it, you can’t do these changes, can’t change compute architecture, you can’t challenge storage capability without memory.</p>
<p>Of course couple of weeks ago we’ve announced a revolutionary product in 3D XPoint. So, beyond our core technology today, we think 3D XPoint is going to be a game changer, not just in today’s applications at the high-end of our spectrum of what we market to but we think it actually redefines what’s profitable. We think for things like in medical, the speed and the performance and the capabilities of 3D XPoint will enables us to distribute to how people are able to diagnose their diseases; how quickly we get people curious.</p>
<p>And so when you think about how we’re looking at our business, we’re actually defining our product for the end market. I think that’s a big shift that you’re going to continue to see in the memory that it’s not just one size fits all in memory. We’re defining technology for the long-term to help these problems that people are having today. We’re excited about that opportunity and the role Micron can play in that. So, you can see it’s a big shift in our business. The business is expanding and it’s also expanding through different model, not just the scale of it but it’s expanding to different model. The legacy memory business that we participated in for years and demand fulfillment model is becoming less and less part of our business. What we are doing now is investing in resources and capabilities to develop value added products with a whole host of different customers. Major OEMs, hyperscale customer, different channel partners. Mark referenced earlier, strategic partners. How can we do things differently, how can we innovate together?</p>
<p>We’re having conversations with the end markets. You could imagine government and security being an issue. I just gave you an example about medical, gaming, consumer entertainment, the whole host of things that we look at. And the conversation is starting with the end market opportunities, what do we need to do, how can we innovate, how can we work together, what are the type of products you need to create to solve your requirements. That’s a different discussion than 10 years ago, let’s shrink the die and let’s start with PC guys and put in a hub and hope they pull. That’s a different model. And so we’re investing in this to provide these value add solutions. And by the way, it’s not just chip level; it’s much more than that. The complex business is beyond just silicon. How we stack products, how we package products, the firmware and the software that we additional. And it’s all different because there is different requirement.</p>
<p>In phones, power is a big issue. In automotive, power is a big issue but industrial plants, they have to operate at certain weather conditions, it just has to be done. Networking provides another set of opportunities. So, this is the different business, a fundamentally different business and that’s how we’re reacting to it and that’s how we think about investing in it.</p>
<p>One of the ways we measure things and how we’re doing on this curve and we continue to measure the players. How are we doing relative to our competition in utilizing our capacity, our capabilities and placing our product in these high value segments. So, it’s nice to put these slides together and talk about tomorrow, what have you. But we need to be making sure that we’re getting somewhere on this path and we are. One of the ways to measure this is how much are people paying up for the broad portfolio of products and how good are we at putting these products in the end markets that are attractive to us. And we’re pretty confident that we’re leading the path here.</p>
<p>We get more broader products by putting them in these high value add applications, both in NAND and DRAM. And we talked about it before. Automotive is very big strong segment for us, we do very well in networking, very well in servers, even in mobile continued growth and leadership. If we think about mobile for example, if you take out the fact that one of our competitors consumes a lot internally, we’re the largest provider of mobile memory solutions. So the innovation and the capability to put our product into these higher value segments is our focus. We do sell commodity products. So, I am not trying to suggest other way. But the mix of what we’re doing as a company and our mission at Micron is to take that capacity and put it in the best area. That’s high return areas, the areas that actually we develop core properties is in to drive value.</p>
<p>Mark talked about investments and the message that we are going to continue to invest in the cycle is we believe so strong in our future and the long success of the business. And this is really when we think about it, this is really the first time the Micron can get up here and say we have the financial wherewithal to do so. And we’re going to do so.</p>
<p>Now in a capital intensive business, returns don’t happen overnight. That’s just the nature of the big ticket item and there is a process that happens. There is research and development being done and that research and development then gets handed over to manufacturing and equipments put into fab and of course you’re taking our older equipments at time and you’re qualifying the product for you own internal qualification, then you got to bring customer qualifications; and it takes some time. That’s the nature of the business.</p>
<p>We talked -- actually Mark talked a year ago at our event. He said 2015 and the slide was execution year. Of course every year is an execution but his point was that we have a lot going on and a lot of investments to make to position us for long term success. And the fact of the matter is we have line of sight on these investments. And the point of this chart is yes, 20-nanometer has been a big focus for us and we’ve made a lot of progress and Scott is going to go ahead and talk a little bit about that progress.</p>
<p>Even product mix, low power, DDR3 and DDR4, it has an impact on our ability to grow as we transition to the end state. On the NAND side, obviously we’ve been very focused on our 3D NAND development and production. And beyond that, emerging technologies. We just announced a pretty significant revolutionary technologies two to three weeks ago. And just that we’re doing the background everyday execution. So, we’ve all had investments. Our message to you is we need to invest. This opportunity doesn’t come for free and we’re going to invest through the cycle to position us for continued long-term success and we want you to know that we’re starting to see it. We’re starting to see it in our business and we have line of sight in 2016 that you’re going to see more of it because of the investments we’re making in 2014, 2015 and that’s the nature of the business we’re in.</p>
<p>What does that mean specifically? Beyond NAND and DRAM, these two technologies show up. We have capacity to do things. And the mix of products and how the memory business is going to behave, something like 3D XPoint will be a material part of our business. I mean in two years, that’s going to be a major segment for us in terms of how we use our capacity.</p>
<p>And as we think about our business, as I said to you earlier, I believe that’s the memory business, memory for specific applications that help drive differentiation and innovation. So a sense on where we are from a bit growth standpoint because I know that there is some of the traditionalists in the room who’d like to know okay show, what does that mean to us. The bottom line is with all the shifts in technology, all the mix issues going on and what have you, ‘15 was a year that our cycle lined up to little bit lower than the industry in terms of DRAM. And we expect to be back in line and grow at least with the industry in 2016, second half of 2016 during [ph] our fiscal year. We expect to be back in line. We see that. Those investments I’ve made -- I’ve mentioned are going to be putting us in a position to be back there in addition to tremendous growth in NAND. We fundamentally believe in the NAND business. We know it’s going to be more turbulent than DRAM. But we’re in this for the long haul we’re investing for the long haul.</p>
<p>So, what I’d like to leave you with today is a few things. We believe in this business. There are cycles. As I mentioned earlier, we’re not calling the bottom of the cycle that’s not our objective today. But it feels like the cycle that we’re in, we’re in a cycle that in 2008, if you had told me hey, in the range of 30% gross margin in your business, it’s going to be the middle of the cycle and we’re taking it then. That’s the new memory business. And we think we’re in great position to go forward. We’re going to continue to invest and push to high value segments because I think we’ve developed a core competency and we’ve demonstrated that how we measure it to deliver on that to, add value in our product.</p>
<p>Of course we’re going to manage our business on a daily basis to make sure we’re making the great short-term decisions and there is risk and rewards and there is ROIs and what have you. Of course we’re going to do that. That’s what we [indiscernible]. But we can’t lose sights of the straight opportunity for us in Micron and play a role in the changing transformation of this business. We’re going to invest to grow. As I mentioned, capital intensive businesses, the returns on capital overnight; we’ve invested a lot in 2015; there’re investments we need to continue to make to take advantage of this market opportunity but we’re starting to see some of the show up and you’ll see throughout our fiscal year ‘16, you will start to see more benefits of that investment as we grow.</p>
<p>With that all, we expect to drive relative operating profit expansion in given market conditions. What I mean by that is we think we’re going to do better than our competitors given our plan and that’s our aspiration to grow.</p>
<p>So, I’d like to stop now and ask Scott DeBoer to come up. Scott’s going to give you little bit more detail on the technology direction and where we’re in some of the recent efforts.</p>
<p><strong>Scott DeBoer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Mark. Today, I’m going to spend most of my time focused on our core technology, really the current status, some of the next generation pieces in terms of our tactical solutions to support our major customer requirement across memory space.</p>
<p>When we look at high performance memory, our DRAM scaling, we’ve talked about, I’ve talked about here many times before, headwinds in terms of process complexity, in terms of physical scaling limitations and those are all true. At the same time, we have line of sight to three technology nodes we are working on right now in R&amp;D. I think I’ll go through in some detail, our 20-nanometer satisfied now; we’re really pleased with where that technology is. It’s on plan; teams are executing well; really I think starting to hit on all cylinders coming out the post acquisition time. And we’re bullish on what you’re going to see out of us in the DRAM technology area over the next several years.</p>
<p>On NAND scaling side, we see a fundamental path to scale vertical NAND technology for the next decade in manufacturing. We continue to view NAND technology as the lowest cost per bit long-term option for solid-state storage and we are very confident our technology execution path and our manufacturing ramp. And I’ll go through that in quite bit of detail today.</p>
<p>In addition to our main core product technology areas right now, Mark -- both Marks referenced the 3D XPoint technology that we announced in San Francisco couple of weeks ago that’s a major innovation coming out of our technology development teams. We have some other ones behind that. And I’ll talk a little bit about innovation in Micron in general and why we have confidence to bring something as new and revolutionary as that along.</p>
<p>So starting off with our DRAM technology, fundamentally we have -- we’re in the middle of our 20-nanometer ramp right now. The technology is qualified and ramping in both Hiroshima and in Inotera right now. The technology status in both the two facilities is actually relatively the same right now. Good progress in both those fabs and really executing to plan, right now. I’ve got a couple of graphs on this particular slide to give you an indication of where our 20nanometer technology plan is right now.</p>
<p>At the top showing that we expect our bit output on 20-nanometer and below technology to be more than half of our bits produced really by the end of this calendar year. And you can see that plot by fiscal year on the slide here. And we’re on track to do that right now. Now how the two fabs do that transition is somewhat product dependent, depending on which products we are displacing but the net of all of our bits produced will be greater than 50% by the calendar year.</p>
<p>On the bottom graph on this slide is the representation of where this technology is right now relative to our yield ramp through the similar phase, there are 25-nanometer notes. And I think this is representative of a couple of things. Post the merger of the technology team, we spent quite a bit of time understanding what we needed to do in terms of manufacturing capability, recognizing some of those headwinds in terms of process complexity and difficulty in ramping technology that faces everyone in the DRAM industry and we’ve put a lot of effort into understanding how we’re going to continue to improve in terms of early technology introduction and ramp capability. And I think the data right now for our 20-nanometer relative to 25 is a representation of progress from this DRAM technology team over the past year.</p>
<p>1x technology node is also now under development in Hiroshima and making good progress there. We started that technology node out in Boise and now have the collective team working on it in Hiroshima and marking good progress. Our 1x nanometer technology really is going to be starting a ramp in the second half of calendar ‘16. It’s really a volume story for us in 2017. One of the things I wanted to also talk about today relative to our DRAM technology efforts are, as many of you know, we have a collective team of people we put together out of Elpida and Micron post the acquisition. I think that team is really coming on. We have a much stronger resource base than we have had in many years on a DRAM technology. And we put a great deal of focus. And that innovation we’re starting to see coming out of that collective team is I think very impressive and I think you’ll continue to see a growing contribution in our DRAM business from the momentum that team is picking up over team.</p>
<p>Moving over to the 3D NAND space, just as a reminder, our leading high density product on 3D NAND are a 32-tier 256 gigabyte MLC product and a 384 gigabyte TLC product. This technology is still the highest density technology of any announced or currently in production technology, whether it’s plain or 3D in the NAND space, especially the 384 gigabyte TLC product. So, this technology is we think positioned for the right entry point into 3D NAND technology into volume manufacturing. And we think it comes in at a good cost point and we’re very pleased with where the progress is on the technology.</p>
<p>Like DRAM and maybe even more so from the grounds up on this technology, we recognized it as extremely difficult and potentially disruptive technology that is probably the biggest shift in the memory business in decades in how memory is actually constructed, fundamentally different. Recognizing those challenges and if we put extra focus into really understanding where the technology needed to be from manufacturing point as we’ve put it in position to RAM. And I think we’ve had some actually pretty amazing results in terms of early success on ramp capability for 3D NAND. A couple of years ago, if I would have projected where I thought we would be relative to our planar NAND performance as we’re starting technology ramp, we have really succeeded any expectations relative to how this technology has come on. And I think it’s a combination of that early diligence and the development process and some of the technical choices we made relative to our 3D NAND technology that has enabled our yield ramp actually on 3D NAND technology to be ahead of what was historically done on our planar node.</p>
<p>So, we are very proud of that right now. We’re in the process of ramping up TLC products for mobile, for storage and I think have a very solid path to continue the density leadership, cost leadership position relative to our 3D NAND technology is it ramps up.</p>
<p>As a result of the early success on our 3D NAND, we’re actually now looking at pulling in our prior expectation of -- that we have discussed having our bit -- previously we said we’re going to have our bits on 3D NAND exceed, our bits on planar NAND in calendar year ‘17. We’re actually now projecting that before the end of calendar year ‘16, we will be able to have more bits produce on 3D NAND than on planar NAND. So overall very positive feeling, great execution by the team on this technology.</p>
<p>So next big thing for us on 3D NAND are really around continue to execute this into maturity in manufacturing in terms of yield and ramp levels. And then moving on, we have good results on our next generations right now that’s in development phase and is partially running in our Singapore manufacturing fab right now also and then really getting the volume up on our 3D NAND technology. So, the picture on this particular slide, showing really the working day and night right now to get this manufacturing fab to ramp 3D NAND up in Singapore. And the overall team is very focused on getting first wafers out by the summer of 2016. So, a lot of efforts there.</p>
<p>Something I wanted to do is talk a little bit more; we haven’t shared much detail on our technology intentionally, since we think it is a competitive advantage. I wanted to talk a little bit more about some of the basics of Micron’s technology relative to at least the currently announced technology from our competitors.</p>
<p>I’m going to talk a little bit about why we did this. And the main reason is at a fundamental level we think that our technology is going allow this rapid pace in terms of ramping the technology maturity and provide some advantage there. When we started out looking -- and I’ll promise, I won’t get too technical here. When we started out with this technology, one of the basic concepts for us was take the fundamental cell technology out of the critical path by picking a technology that allowed us to fall back on decades of liabilities improvement and physical understanding and pick that physical cell as the basis and face the other challenges in terms of this new complicated memory architecture with a known base of a solid cell technology. It’s kind of a core choice. There is other ways to do it and those ways will have other challenges and other advantages. In the end, we think the combination of this cell technology and the manufacturing capability focus we put early in the development cycle are really going be advantages to us as we go into this long ramp. So, we feel very good about this.</p>
<p>Now, I’m going to change base here a little bit and talk about innovation in Micron in general and how that’s leading to 3D XPoint and in some of the other new technology areas that we are thinking are very important going into future. And one of the things that I wanted to do today is really step back and say why do we have confidence that we can take something like 3D XPoint that is very revolutionary and drive that into mainstream memory technology. And what are some of the things that give us confidence that we can go execute on something that is so dramatic as that. And looking back across innovation at Micron over multiple years really, we’ve based several different points in time where we put major focus on programs that actually weren’t obvious but they would work. And I think when we started the 3D XPoint, it was absolutely in that situation. But looking over time, many of the innovations of Micron actually were in that same kind of category, something like 6F2 architecture in DRAM which ultimately of course became the mainstream cost reduction path for the DRAM business across the competitors.</p>
<p>But when we started working on that, it wasn’t obvious and it was a pretty major change for the DRAM industry, picking a couple other in that same category. Pitch multiplication which we -- which is lithography patterning methodology that we brought in on our 15-nanometer NAND really was how we go into NAND business with that core technology and bringing it in first, the rest of course NAND industry follows that and it’s also gone across the whole semiconductor industry now. Those kind of innovations and execution on those has given us confidence that when we face something like 3D XPoint or even vertical NAND that we have the confidence to push it forward.</p>
<p>So, if we look at our recent technology announcements, we talked about in March our 3D NAND and I gave you summary on that already, big technology announcements since the winter analyst meeting.</p>
<p>Then we go to announcements from a couple of weeks ago on 3D XPoint, even bigger game changing technology multiple, multiple years of work culminating in, in a technology that is very unique and also very difficult to duplicate. So, we’ve given very little technical detail on related to 3D XPoint, but I wanted to expand it on a bit just so you have a little more of an idea about what this technology is and also why we think it is such a big breakthrough, to put it together.</p>
<p>If you look at the basic thesis of 3D XPoint, it’s the architecture, the integration, it’s the memory cell itself and it’s a switch. Each of those three things have been major sources of industry and academic resource over multiple years. And there are, if you take something like the memory cell itself, there is an endless possibility of elements. This is one of that the things we use internally sometimes to talk about how many different ways you can build an RRAM memory cell. So, almost every element on the periodic table that either a start-up, a university researcher or someone in the industry has worked on and we usually cross off only the one that are radioactive or tend to float away before you can get hold of them and fix them in a materials set. But other than those almost everyone on the periodic table is capable of building an RRAM memory cell. It’s a great job security for material scientists and it’s a source of almost -- and with startup companies and different things that they can bring out just that RRAM cell. Similar kind of situation for the switch.</p>
<p>And then when you look at the integration of this, there’s many ways you can integrate this technology. Even I think yesterday or the day before there was a seminar at the Flash Memory Summit talking about the cost structure; this is probably awful because you have to have multiple, quadruple patterning levels or multiple EUV with double patterning. And if you actually required that, this memory wouldn’t be very interesting, that’s agreed. But the novelty of this technology is in how you integrate it and how you pick these materials, complicated materials and put them together, all of them along with an integration concept and you make something work, actually work in production that has these properties. Cross point memory is decade old idea. It’s an aspiration of the industry for years, that’s not the new idea. That is how to build something putting unique materials together and integrate it in a way that provides these properties at a cost effective point that’s the newness of t and we’re very proud of this technology, obviously.</p>
<p>When we look at some discussion of where does this technology go, we think it has actually a broad range of uses and a different big business categories may make use of different aspects of the technology. So, if we look at something like a mobile space, the things that are important there may specifically be, how do I get faster non-volatile memory or how do I make use in the mobile space of the fact that it is non-volatile and I don’t have to refresh it, I don’t have active refreshing stand-by. In mobile, you take advantage of on subset of the properties of new memory. When you look at client, there are obvious and Mark discussed some of these previously but there is some obvious ones around putting a high performance cache of some kind of memory in front of the cheapest memory you have possible in order to build a higher performance SSD that is -- makes use of TLC or QLC NAND.</p>
<p>On the enterprise side, there is the obvious application taking advantage of almost all of the properties of the memory with the endurance, speed, and then the pure bandwidth. So I think there is some obvious application across big spaces. And as we mentioned in San Francisco a few weeks ago, one of the things we’re even more excited about is now this kind of memory has become available what is the system people take it and what are the new applications as this expands into.</p>
<p>Now beyond this, we still have focus on multiple other new memory technologies. Obviously 3D XPoint is a multiyear project it is now the bar for memory technology and new memory technology and we have to look father out in the future and it will be away now before something actually comes along that has new properties that provide an additional advantage. And our focus on -- especially on new memory technology relative to other materials for resistive memories or spin torque which is on this slide, are more around the two extremes. So we’re interested in developing memory for the lowest cost and something that compete with NAND long term which is complicated. And as I mentioned, at the beginning in the highest end which is the highest most memory performance possible with the adder of non-volatility. So our long term research now is focused on the extremes and we have a significant effort in the background still on that. So certain 3D XPoint is not the end but it is the major milestone for us and we’re excited about the future options too. So to finish up just touch on current priorities for the next year and where things are and we’ve stated couple of things.</p>
<p>On DRAM really excited about the positive momentum 20 nanometer is on track right now and we’re confident actually that you will continue to see better and better things out of the technology organization working on DRAM at Micron over the next couple of years. On 3D NAND ahead of schedule really pleased with the progress and pulling in the cost over on the technology from 3D and 2D through the end of calendar year 2016. 3D XPoint over the next year is really going to be about maturing the technology, working close to customers and looking at applications to ramp into in calendar year 2016 and in early stage. And then finally we didn’t talk about much today but we’re still very focused on package technology and how we drive differentiation with 3D packaging and custom mobile packaging to add value to our different customer applications. So, those are our big focuses for the next year and below is the roadmap of the different nodes and new memory nodes. So thank you and I’ll turn it over to Ernie.</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Maddock</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good morning everyone. Thanks for joining us today. My talk is going to cover three basic areas; first, give you a quick recap of some of our activities in the capital management area, our dilution management our areas of investment.</p>
<p>Moving to something that you’re all keenly interested in which is the discussion of how we view 2016 gross CapEx but also how we look at CapEx on a normalized basis because we think that some of the changes that everyone has talked about today are causing us to look at CapEx in a bit of a different way as we go forward. And then finally also talk about how some of the changes to the business are going to impact the guidance that we’ve provided you on an ongoing basis that we think will more fully describe the business and also frankly make things little bit simpler for you.</p>
<p>So diving into each of these areas this is a capital allocation strategy of the Company. No big surprise here. Our first priority is always investing in the business, whether that be for the ongoing development of the four businesses of the Company, manufacturing efficiency, technology advancement but also for the development of value added solutions and ways of addressing some of these markets that Mark Adams spoke about earlier today which require evermore custom application solutions and closeness with the customer. And then finally and really importantly over the last couple of years a renewed focus on the return of capital to shareholders and then managing the dilution associated with Company’s capital structure and we’ll talk specifically more about that here in the next couple of slides.</p>
<p>So this does a nice job the time period here is 2011 through 2015 fiscal Q3, so a five year period. The Company has invested about $5.2 billion cumulatively in R&amp;D activities and 11.6 or so in CapEx, all of these design to continue the advancement of our core technologies as well as developing those new solutions like 3D XPoint, things like SSD, things like non-volatile Hybrid Memory Cubes, those are all part of what that investment is buying for us and buying for you.</p>
<p>We’ve also spent up $3.8 billion managing dilution and returning cash to shareholders, couple of hundred of that is in direct share repurchase and the other $3.6 billion has been our activities around the convert exchange we’ve had and then the growth of the Company over this time has also really allowed us to maintain the strength and flexibility in our balance sheet. And I’d like to spend a minute on the next slide, so to demonstrating that to you conclusively. And for purposes clearly this slide actually has fiscal Q4 of our 2015 year included in either the midpoint of our guidance or where we don’t guide some Street estimates. So no doubt through a combination of organic and acquisitive activity, the company’s revenue has grown, doubled in fact, so CAGR of about 16% but that really is sort of the start of the story, what that revenue growth has an enabled is growth in cash from operations at about 50% higher than the CAGR of the revenue growth so you can see that cash from ops has increased over that same time period from that 28% of overall revenue, up to that 32% and also its enabled that scale -- us to reduce our overall CapEx intensity from about mid 30% of our overall revenue down into the 23% range and the most profound difference you see here is in free cash flow going from the slight negative back in that 2011 time frame to a positive nodes of $1 billion as we think about 2015.</p>
<p>It’s a clearly scale has benefit and those benefits are multiplied as we sort of work our way down through the P&amp;L. During this time, we also established this return of capital framework. This is a not new so it’s exactly the same as you’ve seen in the past. We have established a targeted capital structure. I’ll talk more about that in upcoming slides. We’ve talked about our dilution management activities and we have a capital return policy that we now review on an annualized basis and make adjustments for as the business requirements dictate that. I would call your attention to one specific number on the slide which is our activities through 2015 is about 79% of our free cash flow that is a Q3 number, we’ll be provide you an update on that here as we exit the presentation and to preempt a little bit the number looks lot more like our prior year number and maybe a little bit higher.</p>
<p>So, dilution management, it’s worth spending a minute on this topic, there has been tremendous progress made in this area. Net-net -- and this includes the benefit of the cap call -- so it’s all in what we’ve done with respect to the convert retirement, the share repurchases and the benefit of the cap calls, over a pretty broad range of prices, we have essentially reduced the outstanding share count by about 141 million shares and relatively 12%. And if you really go back the things I’m always interested in doing is going back and looking at history, it’s a lowest net share count of the company in the couple of years.</p>
<p>So, it’s really been effective in helping manage the dilution and ensuring that the company does it’s part and returning capital to shareholders. So, quick summary of the past, financial performance revenues extended, scale helps, scale matters a lot in fact, we’re now serving a diversified market with segments in customers that are far beyond anything we’ve imagine in the past. That has allowed us to strengthening our balance sheet and has allowed us to make the necessary investments in R&amp;D in capital and will allow us to do that on a going forward basis as we’re going to talk about here in just a minute. And enable us to make significant progress relative to capital return and managing the dilution associated with being a public company. So, this is exactly the same chart that you saw little earlier today and investing in this sort of productive capacity output, this bit growth is what largely informs our capital plan for fiscal year ‘16.</p>
<p>However, there are some other things in fiscal ‘16 that are pretty unique occur maybe once a decade or a little bit more or little bit less depending on things and that is a fab expansion in Singapore that you saw on Scott’s slide. We also plan to do facility investment on the Boise campus to expand the R&amp;D fab and in addition, as you heard us talk about now 3D XPoint for a bit of time here this morning. There’s an investment in the CapEx plan for next year related to that unlike some of our normal technology progressions has a bit of longer gestation period, it’s a little different than doing the next generation of NAND, the next generation of DRAM. This is a brand new technology that will be a based on some ideas that are maybe a lot older than that, but it takes little bit longer gestation time.</p>
<p>So, all of those unique elements combined with the company’s if you will, ongoing plan and as we look at that, that gives us a CapEx number for next year on a gross basis somewhere in the mid to upper 5 billion range. But I’d ask you to bear with me because just as there have been some changes in the business, there is some changes -- how we think about sort of CapEx and we also -- we’re going to some more detail at here in just a minute. So, this is a historical breakdown that you’ve seen before form us. Starting at the bottom that 20% to 30% of our overall spend will beyond DRAM that is our 20 nanometer and beyond ramping of that technology, pretty straight forward. The non-volatile memory category and notice it’s called non volatile now and not just NAND and the reason for that is -- we’ve actually seen in movement of that XPoint CapEx from that top category which is where you saw at last year into that non volatile category.</p>
<p>So things get born up there and grow into their adolescence in the middle of that category or down below. So it’s real tangible proof that things actually move down between the categories here. So that’s going to be. 40% to 50% of our overall CapEx and remember I said there was some extraordinary items associated with the facilities investment and associated with 3D XPoint roughly 25% to 40% of that non-volatile category relates to investments in those areas. So the reminder of that which would be somewhere in the range of 60% to 75% is for things like the advancement of 3D NAND, TLC and subsequent sort of normal technology progress that we would expect on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>And finally at the top end of technology and product enabling category so another 20% to 30% of our overall CapEx that is where you see the R&amp;D facility in Boise as a part of that CapEx and then some of the things that Scott talked about in terms of leading edge activities at the end consumer working on whether it be for emerging memory and fuller capabilities to other privatization activities. So now used words like net and normalized and are different 2016 let us compared to the past and I am going spend some time walking through that with you.</p>
<p>So starting with our mid $5 billion to upper $5 billion range we have an extraordinary level of investment by third parties and our CapEx profile for next year. So we have some of these between $0.5 billion to as much as almost a $1 billion coming to our directly in support of this CapEx activity and so as we look at sort of Micron levels CapEx it’s somewhere in around of that $5 billion range and as we think about the once a decade investments and things like facility and think about how to help, think about our CapEx ongoing forward basis, we come up with this and normalized CapEx level which is somewhere in that $4 billion range; now make no mistake about it and next year going to be higher. This going be about $5 billion plus all the other contributions we expect but on an ongoing basis we would not expect that level of spending and need to continue in order to support the ongoing ramp of our business.</p>
<p>So hopefully that as in priority gives us some perspective because the world we’re looking at on going forward basis frankly as world different in the ways that it been in the past even some of the partnerships and the increasingly diverse nature of the world in which we were living. That actually also has a big impact on how we guide I’ve been through my first earnings call prep and the company has historically provided the lot of data on a cost a bit basis which was completely relevant back in the days when what we were doing in providing commodity bits and our bit looks like someone else’s bit and that was an easy compare. But increasingly roughly we are providing this average cost per bit in the broad average across the range of product portfolio and decision is a -- set of decisions about what short-term outlook we made versus the building longer term strength of our business and it also reflects increasingly you have to factor into that average that we provide, the various partner arrangements that we have. So in essence we boil all that complexity of our business down into cost for business correct and the reality is that sort of like averaging the weight of elephant in a mouse.</p>
<p>I can give you that precise number because I can put those in demand of scale and tell you what the average is but at the end of the day I’m not really describing either one of those. And so as we think about how to best inform you about our business ongoing forward basis, we are going to make some much more simplified and streamline set of guidance. So we expect ongoing forward basis to give you several company non-GAAP revenue, gross margin, operating expense, operating income and EPS.</p>
<p>Now I would tell you that a guidance statement as we describe our business on a quarterly call so as we’re describing the quarter just completed, we’re obviously going to put more color around that. We’re going give you significantly the same information that we provide today in a historically context because we do think that is helpful letting you know how we’re making progress in our business and what’s going on but ongoing forward basis rather than going through this rather torturous exercise effects or size that taking all of that complexity and boiling it down into some cost per bit metric or a guidance basis. We are just give you at the end of the day, that you’re interested in understanding from us which is where we are going delivering in terms of earnings and what are we delivering in terms of overall revenue growth as well as the margins profile of the company.</p>
<p>So, I told a little early we’re going come back and talk about our capital management framework. Here it is again there is no big changes there still executing in the context of that we have a hurdle for our return on investment to be greater than our capital currently our cost capital is right around 10%. We continue to target a cash balance into that 12 months essentially of our operating expenses plus the short-term debt maturities and interests. We’re continuing to operate to this leverage ratio of GAAP debt to EBITDA of less than 1.5 and CapEx to sales somewhere in the 20% to 25% range. So no changes there; we will continue to update that as it’s appropriate.</p>
<p>So, key takeaways driving long-term returns with the ability to allocate and focus our capital decisions appropriately. We’re going maintain a strong balance sheet, we’re growing business with lots of opportunity and our job as finance folks among other things is to make sure the company has wherewithal to support and to deliver that growth and we are aligning our communications to be reflected and appropriate of the company that we are today which is increasingly diverse, increasingly customized in terms of the products and the solutions that we’re delivering to our customers and we’ll make sure that we both inform you of what we are doing but at the same time try to be as simple as possible in helping you predict our financial performance. And then I mentioned earlier, we’ll provide you a little bit of an update to our activity so far in fiscal quarter four. We’ve actually spend about $630 million so far in first quarter four with respect to dilution management and capital return activities we’ll provide a further update on that obviously at quarter end, but in case we’re getting score that takes at 79% from the prior slide and moved it a little north of 100% and we’ll get the final count as here when we do our upcoming calls.</p>
<p>So with that, I am going to turn it back over to Mark for his closing comments.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Adams</strong></p>
<p>All right, thanks Ernie. And I am going to wrap up very quickly here and then invite back up to take questions for little while. Obviously in summary we like this business, we think it’s a much better business than it used to be, we think it’s worth investing in and we like to call it for playing with. We like our technology positions, we like our global nature and the customer and partner relationships we have and we like some of these new products we are bring in the market. We feel good about where the company fits notwithstanding some of the short-term market challenges that we’re encountering. We’re going to continue to focus on diversification, we’re going to continue to focus on customer relationships and we’re going to continue to deliver innovative new products to the marketplace.</p>
<p>And we’ve got some clear execution objectives in the next 18 months that will evolve around the 20 nanometer deployment as we mentioned by fiscal Q3 you’ll see a majority of our bits at 20-nanometer or below. We’ve got some good technologies coming behind that, you should see an acceleration north of what we talk about previously relative to our 3D NAND and you’ll see as Ernie said the realization of some of these technology development that we’ve engaged in the last couple of years starting bringing those new products in the marketplace in 2016. We continue to generate strong operating cash flow, we expect to make a good progress on our manufacturing efficiency and continue to close gap relative to our deployed technology in the marketplace.</p>
<p>And we think overtime all of that makes Micron a great place to invest over the long haul and we hope to continue to do that. Let me stop and invite everybody Mark, Scott, Ernie and then maybe we can or going to past slides for questions. Let me the one question I got in the back of the room I think I would wanted just to address first because I know everyone in the room is probably interested and have to do with, what are some of the cost headwinds that Micron has encountered. Bring a little bit more clarity to the cost statements we have given over the last six months in terms of our relative performance on a cost-per-bit basis. Because I think many people expected as we move through the year we generate a larger cost reductions than we’ve actually done.</p>
<p>So there is a lot of complexity to our business is very distant, there are a lot of moving pieces around product mix and technology mix, et cetera, et cetera. But let me start with the Inotera relationship, I think that’s a significant one that maybe people haven’t fully digested. When we look at our DRAM products portfolio about 40% of that’s coming from Inotera and historically and through the rest of this year, we purchased that product from Inotera at a market minus and that minus is EBITDA dependent. So as the market gets weaker, the discount to market for Micron decreases and then we sell that product out in the marketplace at a later point in time. There is a headwind there associated with the Inotera supply on outlets that is significant. When you lay on top of that there is the mix adjustments that we’ve made and these are definitely make because we believe there in the long-term best interest of the company as to be in these broader segments and to be in these that will over time deliver more value.</p>
<p>But as we move product from a high margin commoditized PC segment into the mobile segment, there’s a headwind associated with that move just like virtue of the fact that those ASPs were lower in that timeline. There is a similar headwind when you think about what happens as you move from DDR3 production to DDR4 production and ensuring that you have a right pocket for future development. There is another headwind that you encountered you move the mobile product from LP DDR3 to LP DDR4 because of my size is bigger and the yields are lower on these new technologies. So those are some of the big components. What I would tell you is that as we look to the future we have significant as Mark and Scott talked about we have significant ability to grow our bits entity in manufacturing and then overtime that is going to drive cost of good production. Now they won’t be as big as historically you would expect from that amount of bit growth for wafer because we’re coming from the low depreciation base. But you will see it in a significant way as we move through to 2016 and we’ll have profound ramifications in the overall profitability and cash flow of the Company.</p>
<p>So why don’t you guys all come up here, and let’s just open it up to the room.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>A - Mark Adams</strong></p>
<p>Back here.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you expand a little bit more about the new memory 3D XPoint and the Intel relationship. How is that going to exactly play out? Also is there a timeline there because you talk about as the game changing technology. But are you very dependent on Intel here? Are you driving the horse here? I mean any extent to that…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me say a few things and then if Mark or Scott or Ernie want to jump in that will be great too. Intel is a very good memory partner for Micron. And as these guys talked about, Intel is bringing something that’s radically new to the marketplace and the socket test development and the new architecture test and develop. Deployment is not overnight in terms of market acceptance. But having a partner like Intel actually is very advantageous for something like because they are key enablers of those new architectures. So, the relationship with Intel is strong. It will be strong into the future. We will collaborate with them in terms of enabling their supply of product in the marketplace and we will compete with them in the market much as we do in NAND.</p>
<p>We sell in NAND today out of our manufacturing facilities, some of which -- they own some on the NAND and some that we sell to them on a supply agreement basis based on long term agreement. We will have a similar relationship with this 3D XPoint memory but we will also be developing our own sockets for owner applications in areas that are maybe of less interest to Intel and in some cases in competition with Intel. In terms of how quickly will this market grow and how quickly we’ll become significant, I think that is hard to know exactly today. But it could easily be. In the 2018 timeframe could easily be of the same order of magnitude as our DRAM businesses in that timeframe. So maybe not the same size maybe half the size in 2018 but it will be a significant additive revenue stream to Micron at the time. Does anybody want to add anything to that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Just as a follow up to that, still so close to $1 billion of fiscal year ‘16 and CapEx is going to be come from the partner. How should we think about the NAND margin profile, especially the wafers coming out of Singapore going to your Intel partnership? Because based on the existing setup, you ship based on the cost.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes well, we sell them some product at cost, because they own that capacity in the joint venture. And then we sell them some product based on commercially negotiated supply agreement. And those supply agreements are more like a long term customer relationship, they’re more of a much a longer term forward sale of that product. And we anticipate we will have those in place for our partner.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>On a NIM basis isn’t that margin accretive to your NAND business, because more wafers coming out of Singapore or should we assume that there won’t be change in the margin profile for this specific customer?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the margin profile is on the market supply and demand. And we said many-many times, we don’t -- very hard for us to breaking that over a short time frame exactly what the NAND margin is going to be and so they wouldn’t forecast that. We think over the long haul it will be very rewarding business for us. Relative to the product that we might sell to a partner on a long term contract relationship, obviously, we’re going to think hard about what is the trade-offs that we invest and return and strike commercial relationships that make sense to us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And then one follow up for Ernie, thanks for all the color on CapEx. But there is a lot of confusion on the equipment portion. If you were to look at fiscal year ‘16 versus ‘15, how should we think about the equipment portion of the CapEx? And as a follow up to that, how does the D&amp;A change which would have an impact on margins?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, if you look at the equipment portion, you take out some of the commentary I made about facilities I think you will end up getting to a point where you’re saying it’s not that different. We’re not going to give you a specific number around that. but certainly we’ve quantified before in general terms the cost of some of these new facilities expansion and we’ve also talked a little bit about how there is an inclusion for 3D XPoint there. So, in terms of depreciation and amortization, obviously it’s going to trend a bit up over time depends specifically on the timing of some of these capital investments which we’re still continuing to work and we’ll likely to provide more color on that here on our upcoming call.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Quick question on the 3D NAND Flash, so you’re using floating gate I think your competitors are using a charge trap technology. Does that give you an advantage in terms of ramp timing and also how does the performance compare, specifically to wiring speed, relative to 3D NAND from the competition?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>Do you want to go start?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, so relative to the timing of ramp, I think back to kind of where I was discussing previously we think by basing our fundamental cell technology on a known entity and taking that out of the critical path, we think that is a piece that helps us ramp faster. And we think that’s playing out in terms of our yield performance so far. And so I think that’s a net positive for us in terms of that, in terms of product performance, we think that largely that the technology is going to look similar to the end applications and there’s going to be some cases where maybe there is some advantage for floating gate and some cases where there’s some advantage for charge trap. But the net of the whole thing is that the technology what was that much different once it’s in a solid state drive.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me stand on that just a little bit. A lot of the performance characteristics are going to be dependent on component architecture decisions and system architecture decisions that we’ve made and suppose to the underlying cell technology. So, yes, you can imagine in circumstances you might have a right speed decrement for floating these cell but when you get to the end customer, a lot of is going to depend on how does your architecture chip and how does your architecture system in terms of the performance as they will actually see from these devices. We strongly believe that we’re going to see a lot less hiccups and our customer will see a lot less hiccups as we ramp this product in the volume manufacturing because of the much greater understanding of all the fundamental yield mechanisms and reliability mechanisms.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Actually I have two, so first of all, question DDR4. ASP, the DDR4, DDR3 gap right now there’s maybe a 15% premium currently for DDR 4 but of course your costs are higher than that, why that’s a pinch right now on margins, can you talk about the -- that the premium that DDR4 gets in the market goes away by the time that you are able to make up the cost delta between DDR3 and DDR4?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>So, premiums always go away over time because you get to the end of life and there’s a scarcity but the pricing ends up being supply and demand driven. So we would anticipate that over time, you may actually get a -- you need to start see premium for DDR3, right? It’s just a matter of which are these products are in oversupply and undersupply. You are correct but in the marketplace today DDR4 is a headwind for us. We think that is very quickly behind us, we got the 20 nanometer.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And then just one more, you talked about [indiscernible] CAGR being 20% to 30% between fiscal ‘15 and fiscal ‘17. There was a slide that sort of suggested that it was going to be a -- that in fiscal ‘16, I know it’s going to be -- that in fiscal ‘17. So, does that impact something like 35% to 40% in fiscal ‘16 and then something like maybe 10% to 15% in fiscal ‘17 did I…?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>No, we tried to give you a curve that would directionally show you what that looks like and actually there’s an acceleration as we move through time. Mark?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for the invitation. Maybe given the headwind, we’re seeing in the DRAM pricing, could you remind us how to think about the Inotera benefit, which shows on calendar 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, okay. Obviously it’s a complicated better parameter that the drive exactly what that relationship looks like because you have market minus moving to margin sharing, you have mix changes going on, and you have technology changes going on or all of those have an impact. But having said that, when we talk to you back in I think in February, we talked in terms of what would the change be when that new agreement goes into place and when it start to ripple through our plans and said, it’s in the high single-digit kind of margin improvement on the Inotera output as that change happens. We still believe that will be in the mid to high single-digit range notwithstanding what’s going on with the ASP in the meantime because obviously we’ve had margin headwinds under the existing agreement in that timeframe. So the delta benefit, assuming that there is not some ongoing collapse in pricing, we still think that that’s a good stakeholder for delta benefited. We see more price erosion than we are currently anticipating, it will be a little bit less. If we see flat pricing, it will be a little bit more.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Just a follow up to on the ROIC and the NAND business, you talked about 40% to 50% CapEx on NAND. The margins in NAND is still quite limited, so if you look at ROIC, it’s below, right. So, when do you think, Micron get paid for all the investment you are doing in the NAND industry?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>We don’t know. It’s very hard to predict that quarter to quarter. I think there are indications that as we move through 2016. We may have very robust demand for NAND, but trying to time exactly what that is like it’s difficult I’m not going take a stab at it today. [Multiple Speakers] Fundamentally though, Monica, Mark’s response notwithstanding, we still believe that the thing we been communicating you to get back to drive competitive relative better the performance, things like mobile, things like solid state development, other things like; 3D and things like TLC and planer we think the combination relative basis notwithstanding hard to predict price in all stuff. We’re still very bullish on our performance and when we are going there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much. David Wong, Wells Fargo. Two things, first, 3D NAND should I think floating gate versus charge trap; you have explained the benefits of your choice, but can you give us some idea about why some of the other companies chose to go with charge trap. How about some or few benefits is that something easier about doing that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes and Scott can comment more, I think fundamentally it’s a little bit easier to go to charge trap down along side wall that it is a slightly more complicated structure that we have including gates. I think you may see overtime others involved but we gain more confident in our belief to execute for bit so as it realized of this as an existing proof out there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>On the 3D XPoint, how many layers of metal will your initial process have? Can you give us some idea about why it starts out as more expensive than NAND? Is it because you’ve got more metal layers? Is it the bigger cell? Is it more expensive to deposit exotic material [Multiple Speakers]?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re not going tell you how many metals we have and we’re not going how many tiers [Multiple Speaker]. But the fundamental it will be much cheaper than it is without a doubt when you start a new technology you have new equipment and it is slightly under loaded or it is under loaded [indiscernible] working through yield as using this years and [indiscernible] ramp. New technology introductions are always a cost headwind business the technology as currently defined will be much cheaper than DRAM. Your question is what expenses of NAND, yes sorry, well it’s going be more expensive than NAND for quite a while because 3D NAND is very cheap eventually as NAND as 3D NAND scaling close and as 3D XPOINT’s continue to scale or as we add incremental levels of sale for physical locations but we can foresee that that would cost us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>I just want to add, all correct the only thing -- the other thing NAND has the advantage of either MLC TLC or QLC so a number of bits per cell. Most are ramped and our 3D XPoint don’t start out with that capability. We’re still looking at it long-term but there is some pretty fundamental challenges to different kinds of resistive RAM materials that actually making them have more [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Two questions one, you answer most of the questions about the 3D XPoint but long-term the number of layers you can add in 3D integration. Is this comparable long-term you think to flash or is there another mechanism that limits it like yield or perhaps temperature cycling, something like that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>There is -- it actually in this case comes down to about the physical structure. So NAND scaling is all about tiers going forward and how many vertical tiers you make in those are 32, 48, 64 but one of our big numbers of tiers in the whole string is up. On 3D XPoint is fundamentally still a planer technology but another deck on that top of it. So there is actually two different scaling paths which makes us -- it doesn’t compete with NAND in terms of that kind of tier scaling but we have two, or four tiers or may be more but you can also shrink it like a DRAM. So you have actually have two fundamental scaling paths on 3D XPoint and your opportunity to keep scaling down a DRAM like path is -- there is not a fundamental limit to that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And the question is on capacity and market share. In DRAM just like some of the bigger competitor, big competitors are adding or just maintaining wafer capacity and so as you scale and we lose wafers are you going to try to keep market share or is that you have to use 3D XPoint to you think so that market and maintain total market share versus trying to maintain the percentage against the other two competitors?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re going maintain flexibility on all of that stuff and our decisions will be innovative and we are based on our long-term view with the ROIC, right? We don’t need to be any particular market share point in any particular technology. We do need as already talked about we do need an aggregate to have enough scale at the inefficient manufacturing technology developer and to be able to service customers in -- that we care about in market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And you talked in that the last couple of these meetings about things you compared with its oversupply overshot you talked about we’ve seen fab loading down a little bit. Can we build inventory after announced period? And I understand why you haven’t done those things, you haven’t done than much bigger in anyways but can you talk about your thinking along lines going forward Are there still criteria that you would look at where you might run fab utilization well in 100% or you might let inventory build out?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>Well a decision on inventory is somewhat easier than a decision on capacity coming off line. To our inventory is really based on what will you do to market looking over some relatively abbreviated times you would move back that on the line. At the same time our moving capacity also depends on that forward-looking market view but it’s a little bit more complicated because also depends on where you can see the competitor for that is and how quickly do you think competitors will realize what you then else want. And so from our perspective, we are totally comfortable and not running our fab flat out all the time. But at the same time we want to maintain some reasonable market-share and we don’t want to be unnecessarily burdening our forward-looking ability to deliver product to the customers, our cost structure for the benefit of our competitor. So the decision to take capacity offline, I think has to be more credited on is there something structurally wrong over the long haul with the supply and balance demand in the industry and is that something that Micron should do something about.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>As we look for 2017, how should we think about the SSD portion of your mix in the NAND going towards in terms of you talked about value creation and all of them? How so you see the SSD portion evolving and do have all the hold still in terms of your product portfolio to address the market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>We -- needless to say continues to be very bullish on our performance in SSDs and as you project out in 2017 with the byproducts of the portfolio and technology additional investment and control development formula. I hate to type of range on, but I think in somewhere in the 30%, 40% of our capacity at least see in the SSD business mind you that we carried I think by mobile differently and then embedded automotive applications. But SSD will be material part of our business and a capability that we’re investing and it’s again some of the CapEx that capabilities we’re investing in some to control it from example whether it be PCIe type control initiatives. Those investments that we’re making in ‘15 and ‘16 we think that look real good competitive position and like abbreviation for 2017.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>And quick follow-on, not all SSDs are created equal. We have consumer SSDs, client SSDs, data center SSDs, enterprise SSDs and we will target our outlook where we think we have the invest [indiscernible] management can generate [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Just a quick follow-up, there is a question for Scott, so just wanted to understand on given the data end of life whenever it happens do you think that the replacement could be a non-volatile memory and how ready is Micron is this transition happens? And can you give us some -- you gave some flavor for it and how ready is Micron with that and what kind of cadence should we expect, we saw that with 3D NAND people are being talking about it for five years. so just wanted to get your early thoughts of the end of life for data? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Scott DeBoer</span></strong></p>
<p>As I mentioned, we actually have a longer line of sight right now in DRAM technology probably even that we did a year ago just this is time through more focus on future notes right now. But I don’t think the end of DRAM is pending over the next five years. I think we’re going to be strongly positioned again through our focus on new memory technology when it comes time to have something ready for the end-of-DRAM scaling and we are putting significant effort into that and there will be I think that we’re opportunistic for stock more about that over the next couple of years. I do think that it’s most likely that something that expands beyond DRAM lines of in non-volatile memory and primarily because it brings so many other advantages along with it. So the majority of our focus is on non-volatility and high performance on something that can replace DRAM long-term.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Just two questions here on the NAND side as you exit fiscal ‘16 what do you see the mix of 16 nanometer TLC and 3D NAND? The second question is for Ernie, as you look at the guide you talked about giving gross margin and operating income guidance. Do you think you will guide for the full year too or the gross margin bracket should be for the OpEx?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Scott DeBoer</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s an easy one, we don’t plan on doing that at this time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Durcan</span></strong></p>
<p>I think I missed the first one, sorry. Somewhat for competitive reasons we’re not [indiscernible] obviously we’ve talked about our ability to now go-to-market with 16-nanometer thinking of the conversation early about the broader decisions we’re making on capacity and each refractory we have capabilities and we have end market. For example there are markets that are very are still on 25 nanometer NAND, MLC, and so we don’t want to for competitive reasons sell people our recipe. Meaning to say there is 16 nanometer TLC starting from based to now we’re pretty excited to go-to-market and [indiscernible] with three competitive and we think potentially about that, that gives us a little bit of margin uplift in that category that segment because we’ve been out fighting with MLC products up until today. So, pleased to say that we’re going to take every opportunity to drive that capacity where the returns make sense, but we’re also looking at a broader mix of products and how that returns align for the solutions we’re selling into. One other dynamic to keep in mind is that the 3D NAND as it roll-out a significant portion of that will be TLC, and we’ll start at MLC but very quickly that will transition.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>There is clearly an impression out of Taiwan that Inotera is behind their curve as they make their presentation. And you’re saying that you expect to have 50% of our bps out in Q4 on the 20 nanometer. Will that be primarily from -- I mean that the impression has been left maybe it’s incorrect. But would that be primarily out of Hiroshima and the MMT facility, or how do you see that balance going?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Scott DeBoer</span></strong></p>
<p>Inotera is not behind where they expected to be. They are about on track. And we would expect the crossover would occur in fiscal Q3 of ‘16 in terms of Micron overall bps produced including the effects of Inotera.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And on the 20 nanometer, as you talked about you’re scaling into 1x and 1y. Has your architecture, your materials choice for your cap structure et cetera, do you have a path where you feel that you will be able to catch close the gap between where you are now with Samsung?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Scott DeBoer</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re definitely confident in the material path and architecture for the technology rolling out. And as I mentioned, we’ve put a substantial amount of resources into DRAM relative to historical and the team is really starting to execute. So I do believe we’ll narrow the performance relative to the industry leaders and I think our DRAM story will continue to get better over the next couple of years as the R&amp;D investment rolls into the manufacturing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And then your point about re-visioning the way CapEx and the latency for the CapEx to revenue, if you look at people -- some people may in fact view that picking up Elpida in the end of July of 2013 you’ve got a $3 billion, $4 billion CapEx if you will and you put another $8 billion in subsequent rate. So you have a $12 billion over a compressed two year period on a revenue base, it’s roughly equivalent to where you were in August of 2013. Do you have -- could you just give some people give us your sense of what kind of latency changes between where that CapEx would have been spent and where you would expect revenue dollars read out the margins in the market prices, but the revenue dollars to come from that CapEx investment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Scott DeBoer</span></strong></p>
<p>I am not sure I am following all your underlying assumptions. In fiscal ‘13 I think we said about 2.9 billion and in fiscal ‘14 we’re going to spend about 3.8 billion, 3.9 billion, something like that. So the number I think is of course is $7 billion in aggregate since the Elpida acquisition closed. I don’t believe that there is a fee change in the latency relative to capital deployment to bps out for established technologies. I think there is obviously a different a return on investment building in itself we’re investing in erratically new memory technology like 3D XPoint. And I think maybe the underlying missing piece here is some of the headwinds associated with remix of toolsets in Elpida because when you bring in a mismatch toolset and try and collapse technology path there is maybe a little latency associated with that. As well as [indiscernible] had another point into maintenance.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>First question for Ernie, in the CapEx guide you’re pulling out your strategic partner investments, you’re taking that out of the normalized CapEx. But we also heard today that you have a lot of partnership activity that’s not announced yet. You’ve got new memory technologies coming in 2017, perhaps beyond. So, why wouldn’t that component be more of a recurring CapEx versus the discrete in 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>Which portion of the strategic partner investments or third party investments?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>You’re talking about strategic partnerships from normalized CapEx. I am just wondering if how recurring that is given what’s in the pipeline.?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s possible that it will recur on a year-on-year basis, and if so we’ll talk to you about and let you know what it is. But I don’t think it changes the fundamental message is which is on a normalized basis, we think Micron’s business is in that $4 billion range and next we have some extraordinary items, some of which are funded by third parties.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Ernie I had a question for you on startup costs going into next year, specifically for 3D NAND in Singapore. Just given the new toolset that’s associated with 3D is somewhat comparable to what we saw with 20 nanometer DRAM. Just wondering that if you put some timing to that maybe some color on how we should look at that for next year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>Well I mean startup is a pretty broad category. I think the investments in general are somewhere in the [indiscernible] are somewhere in the range of low 100 million per 1,000 wafer starts a week. We obviously have a shell facility that is more an extension area is associated to directly attributable to the start up cost. So, I’m happy to help you out little bit more but there are sort of the two boundary conditions I can give you right now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Just a follow up, may be in terms of margin impact or D&amp;A, incremental D&amp;A.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ernie Maddock</span></strong></p>
<p>As I said, earlier we’re still in the process of figuring out the specific timing of all those investments for next year and we’ll be talking a little bit more about that and the margin impact potentially as we get on our call here coming up.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Durcan</strong></p>
<p>All right, let’s just close by thanking you all. Once again, glad to share a lot of good information with you today. We are bullish on the future and we’re very, very focused on executing for our shareholders. Thanks for coming.</p>
<p><strong>Ernie Maddock</strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
