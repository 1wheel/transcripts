<p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Alan Greer of Investor Relations for BB&amp;T Corporation. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Greer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Anthony, and good morning everyone. Thanks to all of our listeners for joining us today. The acquisition of National Penn is an exciting transaction for BB&amp;T. We are here its strategic importance and acquisition criteria. We have with us Kelly King, our Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. Also to participate in the Q&amp;A session that will follow Kelly’s remarks, we have Chris Henson, our Chief Operating Officer; RickyBrown, the President of Community Banking; Daryl Bible, our Chief Financial Officer, and Clarke Starnes, our Chief Risk Officer.</p>
<p>We will be referencing a slide presentation during our comments today. A copy of the presentation is available on the BB&amp;T website.</p>
<p>Before we begin, let me remind you that BB&amp;T does not provide public earnings predictions or forecasts. However, there maybe statements made during the course of this call that express management’s intentions, beliefs or expectations. BB&amp;T’s actual results may differ materially from those contemplated by these forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>I refer you to the forward-looking cautionary statements in our presentation and in our SEC filings. </p>
<p>And with that I will turn the call over to Kelly.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Alan. Good morning, everybody. And thanks for joining our call. We are very excited this morning about our combination with National Penn. This is a tremendous opportunity for us to strengthen our Pennsylvania franchise, but also to continue to build the scale that is necessary to operate efficiently and with high quality service. So it is a really good strategic move. It is a very compelling. Obviously a nice expansion in our mid-Atlantic region, moves us to number four pro forma market share in Pennsylvania, and of course, it is very, very synergistic with our recently announced and closed acquisition with Susquehanna, which is another outstanding Pennsylvania institution.</p>
<p>It meets all of our acquisition criteria. So it is naturally attractive. It is approximately $1.8 billion in aggregate deal value. It is EPS accretive in the first full year, excluding merger charges and it does exceed our internal return requirements. It is a compelling use of capital. As you know, we had approved in our capital plan for this year $820 million of buybacks and/or acquisitions, and in this case we will be using about $410 million of $820 million as part of the consideration for this, which makes it very attractive for our shareholders.</p>
<p>It is really a nice expansion in the eastern Pennsylvania, Philadelphia market. I will point out that we are very well-prepared to successfully execute on this. As you know, we have a longstanding history of acquisitions and successful [innovations]. We have done over 80 in the last 30 or so years, and so we are accustomed to doing these, and we are doing it at a very measured pace, and though it may seem like a lot here, all of a sudden recently, but it is a very measured pace. We are basically trying to do about two a year, and that is the way – about the way this is kind of working out.</p>
<p>We have done extensive due diligence with regard to this. We have had over 150 BB&amp;T associates involved for several weeks in the due diligence. This is a really squeaky clean company, extremely well managed, and we expect absolutely no difficulties with regard to this combination. It will be a really nice integration because it is a really tight cultural fit between National Penn and BB&amp;T. I began to know Scott Fainor, the CEO, very well over the last couple of years in some various industry affiliated activities that we’re involved in, and while I have got to know him and his team, I can tell you that it is a very experienced management team with deep knowledge, importantly Scott with over 30 years of leadership service in the Pennsylvania market.</p>
<p>He will be a group executive for us, having responsibility for our Pennsylvania regions, and [Maryland], and Washington DC area, and he is bringing along his very experienced successful group executives, most of whom have large bank experience, and now they have had some small bank experience. So they are extremely well rounded. We are very excited about having Sandra Bodnyk, head of the group [Indiscernible]. She will be our new regional president in Allentown, and Sean Kehoe will join our legal team in a very experienced position.</p>
<p>So not only do we get a very experienced long-term CEO to lead our group in that area, but also a very strong team to join him. If you are joining in the slide presentation, I am on Slide 4, some key transaction terms. So as I said, $1.8 billion in aggregate consideration, $13 per common share that is about 16 times 2016 Street earnings. So it is very moderately priced with regard to earnings. It is a little high with regard to tangible book at 2.2, but I [have to recall] this is just a really performing, high earnings company.</p>
<p>It is structured with 70% stock, 30% cash. The National Penn holders can elect what a proportion of cash they prefer, but at the end it will proportionalized so that we end up with 30% cash and 70% stock, and of course, the stock portion will be tax free.</p>
<p>We will have about $65 million fully phased-in pre-tax cost savings, which is about 30% of National Penn’s expense base. We have been very thorough in projecting that. We don’t just don’t swag a number. We go in – all of our executives take ownership of its areas. They have identified these savings with the support of our National Penn partners, and so this is not just a number we pulled out. We feel like it is a conservative and can be accomplished.</p>
<p>Remember that there is overlap in this case. We will probably consolidate around 25 or so locations that helps to drive the savings, and so we think it is very attainable. We will have merger and integration costs of about $100 million pre-tax, which is very reasonable relative to the run rate savings. We will have a Credit Mark of about 3% that we judge to be conservative, but we try to be conservative in these deals.</p>
<p>We would rather be conservative and dated, than not be conservative and miss it. So we feel really good about the Credit Mark. We do expect to close this in mid-2016. Of course, it is subject to our National Penn shareholder approval and all the other customary regulatory approvals. I would point out to you that we have had extensive discussions with our regulators and they are very well informed with regard to this proposed transaction.</p>
<p>If you look at page 5, just a little color with regard to the really nice combination of how Susquehanna and National Penn combines, it is almost a hand in glove type of fit. It does move us from number 7 BB&amp;T, number 9 National Penn, up to number 4, a strong number 4 position in the Pennsylvania market, and of course, as you know the Pennsylvania market is a very strong and large market.</p>
<p>I will call your attention to the boxes at the bottom in terms of the combined market shares, where we’re really number 1 and number 2 in most of the markets. We are in the number 13 position in Philadelphia proper, but with the counties around it we are in a much stronger position in the Greater Philadelphia market. So overall really good market positioning and still plenty of really good opportunities particularly in Philadelphia proper. So we feel good about the combined franchise.</p>
<p>If you look at Page 6, in terms of National Penn’s revenue, this is a very good, clean straightforward commercial retail bank. They have about 74% of their business in net interest income, and so that does give us a lot of opportunity frankly in terms of expanding their fee income business. They have solid fee income business, but it is not you know, as high as BB&amp;T’s. Our fee income ratio is about 46%. So this is one of the attractive aspects of this. They have a really well grounded foundation, long-term standing in a community. Recall that this bank started in 1874, just a couple of years after BB&amp;T started in 1872.</p>
<p>So they have great deep roots in terms of relationships that we will be able to lever as we bring out a more robust product line to them. They do have a nice wealth management business called National Penn Wealth Management. They have $2.6 billion of assets under management. They offer private banking services for high net worth individuals. We will be able to build that really naturally into our wealth management private banking strategies. They have a nice insurance operation called National Penn Insurance Services Group with 11,000 customers. Interestingly they are at the top 20 bank-owned insurance brokerage firm in the country with $13 million in revenue. So again that will fit very nicely into our insurance operation. We will get some synergies there, but mostly have lots of growth opportunities in the future. So the revenue opportunities for this combination is very, very attractive. </p>
<p>If you look at Slide 7, just to put our recent acquisitions in perspective. Recall that we did two acquisitions of tranches of branches in Texas from Citibank. They have both closed, been converted. It is going very, very well. We created two regions in Texas very consistent with our long-term community banking structure. We recently closed and converted our acquisition in Northern Kentucky and Metro Cincinnati area. That is going extremely well. I was there just a couple of weeks ago for our first [all-day] regional visit, and you know, [recall that] they have been a part of the bank for 10 years. They are already up and running extremely well.</p>
<p>Of course, we closed recently the Susquehanna acquisition, and we integrated three regions there with three existing long-term Susquehanna regional presidents running those regions. Now we’re adding one in Allentown with a long-term experienced National Penn. So you see we are very fortunate to have really long-term market players driving these regions, and of course, with Scott as the group executive supporting them, it is just a really, really good situation in terms of market presence, but also the ability to market integrate. Scott is very, very familiar with Susquehanna. He and Bill Reuter, who is the CEO of Susquehanna, have been very close over the years. They have lots of common knowledge, lots of common interest in business activities, and so this is a merger that is really, really very effective and it is going to be relatively easy to execute. Not that anything is ever easy, but it will be relatively easy.</p>
<p>So we feel great about how that fits in. A little more color with regard to that on Slide 8. We have said to you consistently for seven or eight years how important diversification is. So, you know, we have said you should expect to see us do mergers and organic growth activities in large markets, small markets, rural markets, metro markets, fast-growing markets, slow-growing markets, high net worth markets, not as high net worth markets. All of that [by design] has served us very well through the great recession. It continues to serve us very well and if you see on Slide 8, you will see that it is just more all of the same.</p>
<p>You know, Philadelphia is large, Allentown is midsized, Lancaster is midsized and you can see that generally they have little slower growth rates than some markets like Dallas or Washington but high median household incomes and so you get a lot of long-term wealth in those markets, which is excellent for us. So you try to have a little bit of growth in those markets for the long-term established wealth that is available for us, and then into other markets we have faster growth rates. In some cases, you know, it is not as high a level of income, and somewhere like Dallas, you get both, you have good fast growth rates and higher income, but all of it fits together very, very nicely and we have really liked this combination.</p>
<p>If you could have set out some years ago and laid out some strategic plan, and kind of made it the exact way you wanted it, this has been about as close as I could have possibly projected it in terms of how it has happened. Now the key, of course, to all of this is execution, which is all about our community banking model. So if you look at Slide 9, we have said repeatedly over 30 years our community banking model, which Ricky Brown drives, is key to our success. It is designed as you know to focus on collaboration, integration, local visible leadership. That is why I’m so excited about these local regional presidents, local decision making, knowing your client, making sure we focus on the voice of the client. That is why I supported to have local leadership.</p>
<p>Partnering across the bank, our integrated relationship, a process we call IRM, allows us to naturally from day one start penetrating the needs of our clients across all of our fee income businesses, and so that is exactly the way it has worked out. That is the way it is working out in Texas and Kentucky, already off to a great start in Susquehanna. You know, we have been working with Susquehanna now for a year or more, and so it is not likely just started a few weeks ago when we closed. But we are well along the way in terms of Ricky and his team working under the team that is there, it is not likely has been with us 20 years, just a little up more than a year. So we’re really good at this I would say. I don’t want to brag audaciously, but just, you know, assuring a confidence, you know, we know how to work hard on this. It is hard work, but our people do it really, really well.</p>
<p>I would then call your attention to Slide 10, just to make the point that you have heard me say many times before, overarching all of this is the long-term culture of BB&amp;T. BB&amp;T’s culture is not negotiable. That is about our vision, our mission and our values. I will tell you that one of the things that attracted me to National Penn in discussions with Scott and the general reputation of this organization is their culture is almost tit-for-tat just like our culture. This company looks exactly like BB&amp;T and Susquehanna as well.</p>
<p>So while it is three companies coming together in a fairly short period of time, it is three that are very, very common in looks and culture and style, and so you will this fall together very, very naturally and with Scott’s leadership I think it will go extremely well. </p>
<p>And then finally, I will call your attention to Slide 11, just to share some recent recognitions that proves the point that our strategy works. Keynote Magazine recognized us recently as the Best Overall Customer Experience in retail banking websites, third straight year by the way. We were recently listed by Bloomberg as one of the strongest top 15 banks globally and one of only three in the United States. So we were very, very proud of that.</p>
<p>TNS recognized us as outstanding awards in commercial banking. Greenwich continues to give us outstanding recognitions. Last year we got 22 regional and national awards in our small business and middle market commercial business. Retirement income and institutional services area we got 33 Best-in-Class awards and the one that I recall as being really more important than any of these long-term is the Training Magazine ranked us as number one among banks and number 13 in their Top 125 list of best training and educational institutions and so, we feel really good about our ability to train and educate our folks to execute on our quality of service model.</p>
<p>Finally on Page 12, just to summarize, again it is very, very exciting. It has been a nice build-out of our mid-Atlantic markets, solidifies our position in Pennsylvania with the fantastic market, number 4 market share, compatible culture, compatible community banking model, excellent combination in terms of synergies with Susquehanna and National Penn, value accretive to our shareholders short-term and long-term, consistent with all of our acquisition criteria, community banking models will drive the success and we are already off to a good start with it in Susquehanna, we will be moving quickly with regard to National Penn.</p>
<p>Our culture has been and will continue to be a critical part of all of our acquisitions and, of course that is as I have said the fact that our vision, mission and values are non-negotiable.</p>
<p>I will point out to you in closing before we go to questions, that we have been pretty busy lately. And this is our third bank acquisition in a fairly relatively short period of time, and so you can expect to see us take a bit of a pause now, and be tightly focused on executing on these acquisitions that are outstanding huge opportunities for our shareholders, and so we’re not going to take any risk around execution. But if you don’t execute well then you don’t get the benefits.</p>
<p>And so we will take a pause in terms of bank acquisitions for a while now and focus on executing on these acquisitions, which we are very excited about and we believe will generate very good long-term returns to our shareholders.</p>
<p>So Alan let me stop now and turn it back to you.</p>
<p><strong>Alan Greer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Kelly. Anthony, at this time if you can come back on the line, and explain how our participants can ask questions.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Ken Usdin with Jefferies.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Usdin</strong></p>
<p>Thanks good morning guys. I was wondering if you can fill us in a little bit on some of the numbers behind, can you talk a little bit about any tangible book and capital CET1 dilution first of all? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Ken, this is Daryl Bible. What I would want to emphasize on this transaction, if you look at their earning estimates for ’16, we are buying a 16 multiple. When you factor in a 30% cost savings that brings the multiple down to 11, and then if you look at the strong capital that National Penn has, they had over 12% common equity tier 1. If you factor that in that is well over $100 million. That gets the multiple down to under 10. So we think that we are buying the earnings stream at a very reasonable price.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Usdin</strong></p>
<p>Okay, but no – is there explicit numbers you can give us on TBV and CET1 for BB&amp;T?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>So, when we modeled this transaction, assuming it was a 100% stock transaction. So no cash. You actually have a tangible book dilution of around 1%. If you do an earn-back versus those numbers, it is a little bit less than 5 years. So we think that is a very reasonable period to be earned back. Now that we have put 30% cash in the transaction that in essence is using two quarters of our repurchase. As Kelly said, our repurchase goes down to $10 million. You know, each $200 million of our repurchase added about $0.02 on an earnings per share basis.</p>
<p>So this deal is accretive on an all stock deal a couple of pennies, and then when you add in the 30% cash, which is basically two quarters of repurchase, you can kind of do the math, but it is very accretive. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Usdin</strong></p>
<p>So the cash makes it obviously more accretive because of the less stock, but that is more than overwhelming the loss of the buyback?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Compared to the buyback this is definitely better than a buyback. It is a great institution as Kelly said. It is a great earning stream. So we are very optimistic about it, but the combination of all that really fits together well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Usdin</strong></p>
<p>Okay, and my second question is just on the buyback then, so [having it] is turning it off for the next two quarters effectively, and then would you look to turn it back on either after the vote or after close, and then also what does it mean for next year or maybe too early, but just I know we’re getting the question already?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think the way we think about it Ken is that we’re basically committing half of our buyback with this transaction. So you won’t see us have a repurchase for the third and fourth quarter of this year. Assuming nothing else goes on then, you know, you would see us, you know, start our repurchase in the first quarter of next year. This transaction allows us to hit our capital targets with sector with the buyback. So overall this fits really well with our capital plan that we submitted.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>And then Ken, obviously this is too early to have any specific numbers with regard to ’16, but with the kind of profitability we have and you could expect ’16 probably to look like 15, while we will have excess capacity, you know, for buybacks and/or acquisitions, and you know, we’re always going to prioritize our capital utilization, as we said consistently in terms of organic growth, dividends, M&amp;A and buybacks. But, you know, sometimes it works out for all and in this case it is really a combination. If you think about it, this is a combination of M&amp;A and buybacks. It is a very efficient way to do it. And so that would be probably what you should expect as you look into ’16.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Usdin</strong></p>
<p>Understood. Thank you guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Mike Mayo with CLSA.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Mayo</strong></p>
<p>Hi, Kelly, you talked about fishing on the side of the boat where there is fish. I guess you caught another fish on the same side of the boat. How was this process conducted, was it just one-on-one negotiated, was it a bid, and just if you can elaborate more on the slower growth aspect of Pennsylvania, you mentioned it is not as fast as Washington DC or Dallas and you know, what is the performance like in your slower growth markets versus your faster growth markets, I know, you can have it both ways, like BB&amp;T has a great [footprint] in fast-growing markets and now this is your second acquisition in a slower growing market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>So Mike, you know, the fishing analogy is probably a good one. You know, it is kind of hard to know exactly which side of the boat the fish are on, but when you have been around 43 years like me, you get some experience in fishing. So we’re glad that we were able to find a great one on that side of the boat. But what we are really trying to do is be is we are trying to keep orchestrating. You know it is not a perfect plan. What we have done to orchestrate these acquisitions so that we are continually keeping diversification around the nature of the markets, which includes [well] factor and the growth factor.</p>
<p>And that combined with the fact that wherever you go you want to have large scale, and density as you know matters a lot, and so, you know, when we decided to go to Pennsylvania, which is a contiguous part of our market. It is the third most populous state in our area. If you went to a really slow, really tiny little area that wouldn’t make much sense, but when you go to a really large state, one of the largest in the country, with one of the largest NSA in the country, and you go in and you can immediately within two years become the fourth largest bank, then all of a sudden you go to a place where you have the scale to be able to execute on a large stellar existing business.</p>
<p>It is growing. It is not just growing as fast, but keep in mind and you know this well Mike, but you know, a lot of people getting [mammoth] with these fast growth markets, and these fast growth markets are really exciting until they are not growing really fast anymore and they start tanking in the middle of a big correction that we have been through that and so, we like a lot the comfort of a slower growth, but they are not nearly as likely to bust in the boom times.</p>
<p>They don’t boom in the boom times, but they don’t bust in the bad times, and so we have got some boomers and we have got some ones that won’t bust. And that works together really, really well for us and I think the proof is in the pudding and what we just did through the latest recession, I think it will work that way for us in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Mayo</strong></p>
<p>And then one follow-up, you mentioned growth, and I guess I would add competition, how is the competitive environment in Pennsylvania, I guess PNC has expanded down south and you are expanding more into their headquarter state, how is competition in Pennsylvania?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>It is very similar to where we compete everywhere else. We will be heads up against PNC and Wells Fargo and PNC. Although PNC is – we’re not over there in their home territory, and so we think that the competition we will see there, based on what we are already seeing with Susquehanna is exactly what we see in other parts of our market. So no better, no worse, about the same and to be honest Mike, we like it when you compete with good companies like PNC and Wells Fargo. You know, if you give us good rational competition out there everyday, we feel great because and it gets down to execution. The truth is everybody has about the same general strategies, and it gets down to who executes the best and I think our track record shows that we execute very well. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Mayo</strong></p>
<p>All right. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from John Pancari with Evercore ISI.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Pancari</strong></p>
<p>Good morning. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Pancari</strong></p>
<p>Just regarding the accretion again, I just want to clarify, with the 70% stock, 30% cash, 30% cost saves, you mentioned nicely accretive, what is [Indiscernible] are you talking 2% to 3%, I just want to be able to get what you are viewing as the actual accretion from this deal?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>So John, if you looked at it on an all stock basis the deal is accretive a couple of pennies. If you factor in a 30% cash, which is in essence two quarters of our repurchase program, you know, each quarter our repurchase program added about 2 pennies.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Pancari</strong></p>
<p>Right. Okay. I’m just trying to clarify exactly what that interprets into I mean by math so low-single-digit percentage accretion, but I just want to make sure that’s consistent with what you have mentioned because as you mentioned nicely accretive, so…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chris Henson</strong></p>
<p>So, yes I mean if you factor that two together it’s close to 3% on the first full year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Pancari</strong></p>
<p>Okay, alright and then in terms of the timeline for the expected cost sales, can you just give us a little bit of color around the expectation there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chris Henson</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We usually model that we get about half of it in the first year and half in the second year. A lot of times we do better than that but that’s what we put into the model and load out better, each deals are little bit different power plays out but we put pretty conservative estimates in our models when we run it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Pancari</strong></p>
<p>And then lastly Kelly you had, I know you indicated that you expect a bit of a pause, I know this might be [indiscernible] but just trying to understand, how do you define pause, how long that timeframe should we be thinking here?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>As soon as I decide what that is, you would be the first to know. The truth is I don’t have an exact date on that, but here is a concept. So the way that it work, we announced Susquehanna a year ago, we closed it several weeks ago, we have converted probably in November. So by the time we get to converting National Penn, it will be about a year. So they’re stretching out nine months through a year kind of apart and so if we would have announced another one say in two to three months, we would end up having a closed it and be a long time outlook before we convert it, we don’t like to do that. So part of it is, you don’t want to have [indiscernible] and hangs out there long time before you convert it but the most important part is we want to stay targeted focus on executing what we just announced and so if I had to guess what Paul’s mains, I would guess remain 6 to 12 months, but that’s not five years and it’s not 90 days.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Jack Micenko with Susquehanna International Group.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jack Micenko</strong></p>
<p>On the 100 million in-merger costs assuming sort of mid-year ’16 closing, should we think about evenly spread over the back half of ’16 or like the cost savings is that also more join out into the second quarter. How should we think about putting in the model?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>I mean typically that the bulk of one-time costs come when the conversion occurs. Right now, we had to guess when this conversion would occur probably the mid-year, so June, July timeframe. So I would say our 100 million will be heavy second, third quarter next year would be my best guess what I know today.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jack Micenko</strong></p>
<p>Okay and then looking at the market and I guess opportunity obviously I think you have got a lower fee income mix, but a lot of the same businesses. I mean could you kind of [indiscernible] rank how you think about the opportunity, is it balance sheet growth, new products is really getting that fee income number up to something comparable to BB&amp;T. How do you think about the first year or two, where is the revenue potential analyzed more?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Let me give general answer and then I will ask Chris Henson to give you a little more detail on that. So all say we have a good foundation and for example wealth management and insurance. But they offerings not nearly robust as ours, there are the two cases where you expect to accelerate their revenue immediately. Simply because you got people on the ground, they’re use of doing it, they’re use of sell it, we just give more arrows in quiver. And so that will move very quickly. Other areas investment products and things that we have that we sell abroad up credit offerings. All of that again and you are selling them through people that are very comfortable selling those products, so there is not a big ramp up time in terms of learning.</p>
<p>So frankly I think the whole fee income area will move up quickly because they have really good people on the ground, they know what to do they haven’t had products, will have the products and so they will move fast. We did modeled it getting up to BB&amp;T’s 46% likely in few years or something but it's I think we have modeled all our liquidity in a couple of years get up to 30% or something like that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chris Henson</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think we get to the mid-30s in the five year timeframe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chris Henson</strong></p>
<p>Here again so very conservative.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>But honestly we can get much closer to BB&amp;T level with our five year period what do you think Chris?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chris Henson</strong></p>
<p>I think it's exactly right. One thing to remember about both Susquehanna and National Penn is different from most acquisition is they come to us with a foundation that they have insurance agencies that's atypical from what we would normally acquire. So we have combined about $25 million in revenue between the two and it gives us the platform when actually to start bringing our specialized products, like security products, any kind of specialty that we offer in insurance plus we can bring the life insurance to them they won’t that they do not really have the opportunity to offer today.</p>
<p>So there are new lines that we have, but we will also likely have to go to that market and build out a little bit more in terms of insurance franchise so as possible we could do an acquisition in that market and the regional period of time. So insurance is a great opportunity for us that both immediately begin to cross sale existing products and bolt-on additional opportunity later or internally capacity. </p>
<p>Also as Daryl said, there is another great opportunity; they have in these markets very large income in terms of household income. So it provides a real upside we think and we will be able to bring out lending platform to them right away which will be we think a really nice start, plus if you recall we have total in capital of about 50 billion in assets under management they have in both cases Susquehanna and National Penn, asset management companies. We will be able to bring our product array to them that hopefully will help them be able to finish right their distribution which is another really nice opportunity.</p>
<p>So I think those would be the two other highlight and really good opportunities for us to scale up pretty quickly.</p>

<p>Our next question comes from Jason Goldberg with Barclays.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jason Goldberg</strong></p>
<p>Thank you good morning. With this deal and Susquehanna here personally $250 billion asset mark on just maybe talk to as a bring some things with advanced approaches as you grow organically and potentially do other deals in terms of incremental costs that potentially have to factors into this and when you start making those preparations, or with the lot of systems working throughout prior years kind of get you ready for that threshold.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chris Henson</strong></p>
<p>Jason, the $250 billion level one of the giving a lot of discussion today, in fact the Federal Reserve have recently announced that they have deferred indefinitely and consideration of approaches with regard to see our planning. I don't know that there will be any push out or deferral in terms of BASAL advance purchases in general or not but it could be.</p>
<p>In any event the we are assuming that 250 is a firm level and we have already started planning and executing towards being ready for that, we have BASAL 3 office a very-very BASAL-3 person to lead that. Daryl's got a work stream working, definitely has work stream, others have work streams. So we have a very well thought out planned strategy in terms of moving towards that, we get a little leeway until he actually hit it because until we had we haven't had and you do have a couple of years after you had it to be fully compliant, actually three years.</p>
<p>And so it got plenty of time but we are assuming that we're going to about through it but I will tell you Jason actually maybe 220 to 230, when you get the next couple of years organically, or the next deals going to take you over that's when you do some really serious math in terms of all the cost and likely we wouldn't just slide over we wouldn't go from 249 to 251. So we will assess where we are in terms of our kind of our organic strategy of building out that infrastructure. And then, if we have large acquisition that chooses way over that we thrown into high gear we get it moving really, really fast. If not, then we do it on a measured basis and that allows us to manage our cost effectively.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jason Goldberg</strong></p>
<p>Great, I guess, as a sort of follow-up, Penn must be a fairly efficient bank when you are looking for I think 30% cost saves, I mean spend on terms of where you think you can cost saves, I know you touched on some brands consolidations but it seems like this got to be to bid other stuff in their room before to get you to that figure?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Yes, Jason we have a itemized list of tenure I mean everyone of our executive team has done a pretty meticulous projection internal of what staffing they will need, post acquisition, its build up literally $5 to where we know we can hit the sort of some number, a meaningful amount comes 25 or so closing branches but there is also lot of background, it’s seems that they will way into it. in a deal like and so we’ve done enough probably, we’ve got a methodology where we don't just slide it, we literally go in and you look at how many people they have, how their expense structure is and then we lay on top of what a combined operation will look like and on pro-forma what the expense structure will look like and we arrive at the level and then we had a conservative site to 30% to 40% is based on that kind of calculated bill that would a conservative factor.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Gerard Cassidy with RBC.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gerard Cassidy</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, good morning guys. Kelly, how is the digital strategy factoring into these acquisition. Obviously, today it’s considerably different than when you were very active acquiring before the financial crises, but with having on the smartphone and use of, people actually think their deposit accessing their accounts through these digital channels, how are you blending that into this strategy of acquisitions?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>So, Gerard the whole digital transformation of the industry as you know is very-very interesting and it is a really-really high priority for us, we’re focusing enormous amount of attention on that. In fact not for a long ago, after the trip to Australia for several days to focus on some of the companies that are doing some digital transforming investments Chris, Henson and the group went to London recently. So we’re doing a lot of work in terms of our digital strategy which will develop, I mean we trying to assure that we’re really on top that's moving.</p>
<p>But let me tell you what it is, and what it’s not. What it is, is the latest advancements kind of a 50-year paradigm shift, it’s all been one real paradigm shift in macro and beyond and that is the paradigm shift towards convenience of banking, but basically on two aspects of banking, one is the relationship, the trust, now there is transaction convenience.</p>
<p>Over the years as you know Gerard, there’s been lots of stages, first stage was a having a branch and then there was ATMs and there was home banking and then there was debit cards, and then another is digital banking. And so all of that is just one more step up and it’s something around that form of how we do transaction for at last really-really important but it didn’t change the paradigm, importantly to that point, when you do market research today young and all the clients still tell you that haven't access to a good branch which is a number one or number two, reason they select the bank. So today we do have to invest in the trend, the digital transformation infrastructure.</p>
<p>But you really still got to have branches, anybody that leaves today is like just truncate their braches structure, go all the way digital banking is making a [indiscernible] opinion. Over the time, processing activity has changed and assessing that used et cetera that allows with its use, to do good job and downsize than right sizing your staffing in these branches overtime, overtime you will see less big branches, more head branches that kind of thing, but it’s not a 90-day, it’s a probably day-care [indiscernible] fixed we think 20 years matter still we’re righteous, but there will be a lot more transactional activity authority and people watches and phones, and who knows what will have by then, but it's a bid deal for us throughout, we don't think it changes the fundamental nature of the fact you can, what it really could good company like National Penn with a 124 branches, now you net down to a 100 branches and over the time you extract the cost savings that are available from more digital transactional activity, it gets to be a really good long term investment and is solidify your relations with clients.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gerard Cassidy</strong></p>
<p>And then it’s a follow-up question. Two important markets in Pennsylvania we guess our Philadelphia and then Bucks County. You mentioned, you take a pause, you all integrate these transactions that you recently have done. Further interest and trying to build up that market share in Pennsylvania in counties and maybe cities that you’re not in for additional acquisitions down the road?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>I don’t want to try to move the market at that draw in terms of what we really want to do in terms of other acquisitions. But as I said with number four and market share today in Pennsylvania with this combination, we have really strong confidence in our ability to grow organically. So I would not be sitting around waiting for us to do another acquisition in Pennsylvania any timeframe.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Matthew Burnell with Wells Fargo Securities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Burnell</strong></p>
<p>Daryl, maybe a question for you, it looks like the net interest margin of National Penn is pretty close to yours at this point. So presumably the transaction doesn’t have a material effect on your margin going forward. But I’m just curious if the acquisition has any effect on you’re thinking about LCR or has any material effect in your assets sensitivity going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>I think you made a good assessment on the margin, I think we are very similar margins and I think that is a good assessment that our margin for cash really shouldn’t change a whole lot with this transaction. As far as the LCR goes that Penn has very high quality, security also have a very large municipal book, we’re going to try to retain as much of that it can they fit into our credit parameters. So I don’t anticipate any big changes at all LCR calculations I think all that should come through to really while the deposits are good, high quality deposits that we could treated very timely in the LCR calculations, because there operating accounts and a lot of transaction accounts. So I think all of that said, it seems to be positive.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Burnell</strong></p>
<p>Okay and Kelly maybe a question, follow-up question for you. How long does this transaction sort of percolate before getting announced. And I guess another part of the question is a number of other executive, bank executives have suggested pricing has to be adjusted to a certain extent for a potential long tail considerations when they’re looking at buying other banks. And I am then just curious how you think about that in the context of both the Susquehanna transactions and now the National Penn transaction.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Well, it’s hard to define percolation with regard to mergers I mean on the side for a couple of years and let’s say we have both [indiscernible] counsel federal reserve. So we’ve gotten to know which are very well over the last couple of years because we need several days every quarter. But in terms of actually Daryl talking about Daryl knowledge that it’s been over the last 60-90 days. And but this was a negotiated transaction, outside was very smart in terms of recognizing but BB&amp;T was in a position to offer share price or his shareholders. And so there was not negotiated process, it was negotiation between us and we think we arrive that a good combination to makes sense to all the parties.</p>
<p>In terms of pricing and the long tail, well we haven’t had a long tail. So we don’t anticipate the long tail. And so if you work to relevant to the deal anticipating take you two to three years do it, I wouldn’t go and do it. So unless I feel we’ve been doing with an about the one year timeframe I wouldn’t go do it, because the implicit price effect becomes enormous in our view, because when the company hanging out there a long time lots of good things happen, sometime not always. But it’s just a risk that would be really-really hard to take. Before we announce a proposition, you can rest of sure, we have done a lot of discussing it at every level to make sure there is a very high probability, we would be able to execute within a reasonable timeframe not this something fit and change, I can’t promise anything. But because if you thought of reasonable expectation of a really long tale, trying to price set into a data will probably make it an unacceptable deal that you couldn’t do, because the seller wouldn’t, when you sell for price that discount back it starts to deal really big long tale.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Betsy Graseck with Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>So BB&amp;T has been very clear about its acquisition strategy with 5% to 10% of its asset size and growth each year, which make sense, but the deal seems a little early since Susquehanna has converted again, doesn’t matter that Susquehanna have been converted or fully integrated before getting regulatory approval?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>No, not really Andrew, so you have to think about a large effect on the, when we say 5% to 10% a year that what’s we’ve been doing that year or so, it will be now last November, Kentucky and Susquehanna, we’re doing those now we’re announcing this now, it will be done mid next year. So this is a, when you announce that discount put a next year’s deal, so we announced in ’14 that deals that made up our 5% to 10% which turned out to be 10% in ’15. We’re now announcing about 5% that will be a ’16 deal that may or may not be another one to take Kentucky after about the 10% level.</p>
<p>But the cause of way has staggered out as you know we’ve already close and converted bank in Kentucky I mean its running very smoothly already as a BB&amp;T region, Susquehanna is already closed and will be converted in November and frankly a lot of work for the conversions already been done. So it will close pretty natural then and so by the time you get around to thinking about closing and converting National Penn would be way down the road, a year down the road with the award to Susquehanna and the really hard work is up for six months or so to be honest, when you get all there, the planning and the programming and the computer integrations, and training and all that by the time you get an up and running and convert an opened 90% of all the hard work is done.</p>
<p>Now the magic is [indiscernible] conversion were a goes out and moves that they see income ratio up from 24 or 36, the 44, of few years, but the actual risk of the transaction is in the first several months after nine months or so.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Vivek Juneja with JP Morgan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vivek Juneja</strong></p>
<p>Kelly and Daryl when I look at your acquisition price and adjusted for the loan mark, you are paying 2.5 times tangible book, it's a pretty rich multiple, and a more even adjusting for the upfront merger charges and when I do the math on the EPS accretion dilution without any -- Daryl with your 100% stock but with no revenue enhancement your actually 1% diluted, so you early have to give them all of your revenue enhancements to be able to make this deal breakeven and why would you do that, so why would you give it all away to the selling shareholder. Why such a rich prices?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>Hey Vivek, so I’m not sure, I agree and follow your calculations on -- </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vivek Juneja</strong></p>
<p>But Daryl its very simple its just 30% cost savings its CDI and that's all and the shared it’s using projective consensus EPS for National Penn does really nothing more complicated about it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>When we renew our models, that kind of all stock basis, it is accretive of about 1%, --</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vivek Juneja</strong></p>
<p>What with revenue enhancements?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>We did say that we had to see income growing from mid-20s to mid-30s among five years, still well below BB&amp;T’s mid-40’s</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>But you should also know that in that same model its very conservative in terms of deposit growth and loan growth, so we run these models, with very conservative on fee income, with loan deposit growth and properly conservative with regard to expenses, so this might run-rate model for a long-long time you may have the different model that's okay, but I’m telling our model is well established. We’ve done it a lot, we back tested as we do deals, and our models is right, okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daryl Bible</strong></p>
<p>And I get back to on the original comments we made, starting the call in that you at on our percentage of earnings, buying at 16 times factoring in cost savings in 2011 and if you look at the excess capital that they have over 12% tier 1 comment. We basically are buying at less than 10 times earnings for that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vivek Juneja</strong></p>
<p>Yes. But you are also taking moks down that you have to adjust for, you are taking an upfront marketing, you have got more other charges so those also need to be factored into those numbers. And then that 12% will come down quite a bit I mean the mid-term excess that you have, Kelly and Daryl the other thing I would like to get a sense for is buyback since you said you are on hold for 6 to 12 months that puts you into first quarter of next year that means that even next year the second half so to speak may not happen if you do another deal in six months.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>No, if we doing a deal, I mean some of the deal, but assuming we are not doing any other deal we can certainly in the back-half of the, on the second half period, we can definitely execute on the remaining $410 million.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Geoffrey Elliott with Autonomous Research.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Geoffrey Elliott</strong></p>
<p>You have done several of these kind of zero to $20 billion asset type acquisitions. How do you think the effectiveness of the size, guesses, something logic?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Well, I am not really thinking of larger deals to be honest with you. As I have said I think the opportunities set for us in the $5 billion to $20 million asset size. I am not really thinking that there will be any really larger deals done and we are planning on it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Geoffrey Elliott</strong></p>
<p>And then you talked about something larger to cross the $250 billion. You kind of talking about the higher end of high 20 or do you talking about something that meaningfully bigger?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Well, if we would say $240 billion and all that was available was a $10 billion transaction we probably would not do it. For a $545 and $20 billion to $25 billion available we might do it. So it just depends on the math, I am saying is when you get back close and that really nails you and begin to clock-tick in terms of your three year period to be fully compliant then you can just run math in terms of how much you have already done in terms of being ready, how much you have got to do. In fact to that backend and -- into the model they are been considered in the acquisition and if it worked, it worked at the end we would just pass.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>It appears we have not further questions in the queue at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Kelly King</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you everyone for joining our call and we hope you have a good day.</p>
