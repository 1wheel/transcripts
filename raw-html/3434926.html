<p>Thanks, Liz. Welcome to our second quarter 2015 financial results conference call. Joining today’s call from Juno are Hans Bishop, our Chief Executive Officer; Steve Harr, the Chief Financial Officer; Hyam Levitsky, our Chief Scientific Officer; and Mark Frohlich, our Executive Vice President, Development and Portfolio Strategy.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Juno released its financial results for the second quarter 2015 by means of a press release that can be found on our website at www.junotherapeutics.com. During this call, we will make a number of statements that are forward-looking, including statements regarding Juno's mission, business focus, business plans, pipeline; clinical trial plans and timelines; regulatory strategy; the potential benefits of our collaborations; expected cash burn and potential future payments under our license to Novartis.</p>
<p>Forward-looking statements are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties many of which are beyond our control, including the risks and uncertainties described from time-to-time in our SEC filings. Our results may differ materially from those projected on today’s call. We undertake no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>With that I’ll turn the call over to Hans.</p>
<p><strong>Hans Bishop</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Nikki. Good afternoon everyone. Thank you for joining us on our second quarter results call today. I’d like to highlight a number of the most important recent achievements in the last quarter. We’ve had two company sponsored INDs cleared by the FDA. Our most recent data in lymphoma and leukemia are developing positively. And our capabilities have been enhanced through both hiring of key people and business development. I will provide an overview of each of these areas before turning the call over to Mark and Steve to walk through more of the details.</p>
<p>Our recent announcement that FDA had cleared our IND for JCAR015 is an important milestone for Juno. We’ll be moving directly towards Phase 2 trial in adults with relapsed/refractory acute lymphoblastic leukemia that we believe is positive will serve as a registration trial. And so we now have a clear path forward to the approval of JCAR015.</p>
<p>We expect to submit the BLA in late 2016 or early 2017 although for the purposes of setting expectations you should view late 2016 as a stretch goal. We made significant investments in developing and manufacturing approach that is scalable and commercially viable. We believe the skills we’ve developed in the CAR T product characterization were an important part of our success getting this IND accepted.</p>
<p>We’ve transitioned from an academic process to a commercially scalable one. And we’re confident our capability related to process development and manufacturing is going to pay dividends across our portfolio of clinical stage product candidates. We’ve also made significant progress executing our strategy in lymphoma. We believe our recently presented data show the potential to deliver clinical results in NHL that are as transformative as those we are seeing in leukemia.</p>
<p>And we planned to – we have a plan to reach that goal that includes investing in a number of different clinical trials. Previously, we identified improving cell expansion and cell persistence as an important opportunity for improving response rates and durability, basically about that cellular PK/PD or drug exposure methods. In the second quarter, our collaborators presented data that highlight some of the progress we’re making. By improving lymphodepletion prior to infusing CAR T-cells in patients with NHL, we showed a 100 fold increase in the peak number of CAR T-cells, a key mark of expansion and 1,000 fold increase in the number of CAR T-cells at day 28, a meaningful improvement in cell persistence.</p>
<p>Mostly importantly as expected, these increases translated into improved clinical results with six out of the seven patients treated or 86% having at least the partial response by chosen criteria. These data are early and we will need data across more patients including followup on percentage of complete responses and the durability of these responses. That said as a first readout in our multi-pronged strategy to transform the treatment of NHL, these data point to important progress.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, we also presented new data from our leukemia studies including those using JCAR014 and JCAR017. Our experience from multiple trials in ALL have highlighted the importance of not just reaching today’s accepted criteria of a complete clinical remission light microscopy, but reaching a higher standard of complete molecular remission as measured by flow cytometry. We are encouraged by the complete molecular remission rate we are seeing in the JCAR017 and JCAR014 ALL trials in both pediatric and adult patients with over 90% of patients reaching this more difficult threshold. These result supports our belief and the importance of the manufacturing process of CAR T-cell products including controlling the T-cell populations used to make the product. Mark is going to provide more detail on our clinical progress later in the call.</p>
<p>The second quarter was also significant for the company as we expanded our scientific and commercial capabilities. We closed partnership deals with Fate, MedImmune and Editas. We acquired Stage Cell Therapeutics and X-Body and of course we also announced a significant partnership with Celgene. With Celgene, we now have a world class partner that can support the development of commercialization of our pipeline ex-North America and we have the opportunity to increase the technologies we have at our disposal for manipulating T-cells.</p>
<p>We’ve added $1 billion to our balance sheet, which we believe will be a source of important competitive advantage as we continue to follow this fast developing science and consolidate the best technologies. Steve is going to cover this area in more detail later during the call. I’m also pleased to report we continue to be successful growing our company attracting – and attracting world-class talent. Hy Levitsky, a world renowned cancer immunologist has joined as our Chief Scientific Officer. We’re delighted that he was excited as we are about our science and strategy and chose to join Juno, particularly given the breath of opportunities available to him.</p>
<p>I'm also pleased to report that Tom Daniel, President, Global Research and Early Development at Celgene, was appointed to our Board of Directors yesterday. Tom has a tremendous track record in evaluating science, translational medicine, and developing drugs and we look forward to leveraging his experience and wisdom as we move forward. Generally, our progress in attracting great talent has also continued. We’re building an outstanding team at Juno with experience and highly talented people in our key areas of focus, postioning us well to execute our strategy and change the way that cancer is treated.</p>
<p>I’d now like to hand the call over to Mark to talk about our progress in clinical development.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Gilbert</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Hans. Our clinical programs are making significant progress, and I would like to cover four areas today. First, the progress we have made in advancing our ALL program. Second, the results from our programs that encourage us about the development of a next-generation best-in-class product. Third, I will expand on Hans’s comments on our progress in non-Hodgkin lymphoma and our ongoing plan to optimize drug exposure to improve clinical outcomes. And fourth, our approach and plan in solid tumors.</p>
<p>In terms of our ALL program, we are highly encouraged by the FDA clearance of our JCAR015 investigational new drug, or IND, application for the company’s first Phase 2 registration trial. This trial will be in adult patients with relapsed/refractory ALL. The IND clearance demonstrates the ability of the process development, manufacturing, regulatory, quality in clinical teams to execute cross functionally.</p>
<p>We delivered a sound plan to demonstrate the comparability of the Phase 1 academic process to our Phase 2 process. The primary objective of this trial is to evaluate the efficacy of JCAR015 as measured by the overall remission rate in subjects with 5% or more leukemic blast in the bone marrow termed morphologic disease. The trial will also evaluate the safety and tolerability of the therapy as well as other important outcomes such as the complete molecular remission rate, duration of response and overall survival. This study will enroll sufficient subjects in order to evaluate 50 patients with morphologic disease following salvage chemotherapy.</p>
<p>We’ve enlisted 14 investigators of comprehensive cancer centers across the country including the largest leukemia centers. We anticipate enrolling our first patient soon and we look forward to presenting data from this trial, which we expect to be available in late 2016. And the data maturing from our Phase 1 clinical experience with JCAR015, in adult ALL Memorial Sloan Kettering. It’s clear that patients, who achieve a complete molecular remission, defined as no evidence of leukemia detectable in the bone marrow by flow cytometry, have much improved survival compared to those who do not.</p>
<p>This is consistent with data and outcome following other therapies in ALL as well as other leukemias. In the setting of pediatric ALL, patients who achieved a complete molecular remission following induction chemotherapy continue with chemotherapy, while those who achieved a complete remission, but not a complete molecular remission, typically will proceed to a bone marrow transplant. Our JCAR014 and JCAR017 data show that we can achieve these deep remissions in most patients.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, we presented data at the ASCO and AACR meetings from two different trials, each with just over 20 relapsed or refractory ALL patients. In both the JCAR014 trail and adult ALL, and the JCAR017 trial and pediatric ALL, we observed a complete molecular remission rate of 91%. We anticipate that these deeper complete remissions will translate to improved long term clinical outcomes for patients, as we have seen in our JCAR015 experience.</p>
<p>The complete molecular remission rates seen with both JCAR017 and JCAR014 are from relatively small single center trials, but they are differentiated from the data we have generated from JCAR015 and what we have seen from other centers. Both JCAR017 and JCAR014 are defined cell products and these data suggest that the improved outcomes observed in preclinical models where the number of CD4 and CD8 cells are controlled, may be translating into improved outcomes in the clinic.</p>
<p>Turning now to our NHL program, I would like to provide a bit more detail on our multi-pronged strategy to meaningfully improve the efficacy of CD19-directed CAR T-cells and NHL and transform the treatment of this disease. Our recent data from JCAR014 NHL, shows an increasing expansion and persistence, leads to improved clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>Now, I’d like to cover additional aspects of our NHL program. First, FDA recently cleared our IND for JCAR017 and NHL and we are on track to initiate our first company-sponsored multi-center trial in patients with aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma this quarter. As a reminder, JCAR017 has shown particularly robust expansion and persistence relative to other CD19-directed CAR T-cell product candidates to date, even without the use of fludarabine for lymphodepletion. And we’re optimistic that if these characteristics continue to play out in NHL, the increased drug exposure or area under the curve will continue to improve outcomes.</p>
<p>The company sponsored trial of JCAR017 will serve as the foundation for a subsequent registration trial. The trial will enroll approximately 50 patients and featuring adaptive design in which we will explore different dosing schedules. Second, we expect to begin our first trial with our fully human CD19 directed CAR T-cell product candidate before the end of the year.</p>
<p>As you know all of the CD19 directed CAR T-cell product candidate development across the industry to date are at least partially derived from a murine or mouse antibody. We have seen evidence that particularly in NHL patients can have an immune response to this mouse construct. [Indiscernible] represents another critical potential element to improving cell persistence as well as opening up a better avenue for retreatment. Third, we remain on track to initiate our first clinical trial combining our CAR T-cell and the checkpoint inhibitor antibody before year end. We look forward to understanding if inhibiting checkpoint improves the clinical benefits of CD19 directed CAR T-cells in NHL.</p>
<p>Next, I’ll discuss our progress in solid tumor program. We believe that T-cell therapy can be effective in solid tumors based on the clinical activity observed with checkpoint inhibitors as well as results from infusions of expanded tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes or TILs. To address the potential challenges of solid tumors, we are investing in the translational research capabilities to ensure that we maximize our learnings from each of our trials. It will be critical to understand for example, if the cells are harming to the tumor or that they are functional and how the tumor microenvironment may be limiting the activity of our CAR T-cells.</p>
<p>We and our collaborators have done substantial pre-clinical work to select our initial solid tumor targets and are undertaking four trails of the near-term, three of which used CARs and the fourth a TCR. The L1CAM Phase 1 trial in neuroblastoma is currently enrolling patients. The Phase I trial targeting ROR-1 and the Phase 1 trial targeting MUC-16 ovarian cancer are each on track to begin this year or early next year. The MUC-16 trial, we will use our first armored CAR in which the cytokine IL-12 will be secreted from the CAR T-cells in addition to expression of the CAR construct.</p>
<p>Finally, the Phase 1 trial of a TCR directed against WT-1 and patients with non-small cell lung carcinoma is currently open. Our research team is evaluating additional CAR and TCR targets and pre-clinical development is underway for several of these new targets. Our academic collaborators are also making progress on other targets. We look forward to providing further detail on these programs in the future. </p>
<p>In summary, we have made substantial progress so far in 2015 on multiple fronts: regulatory, clinical and in research. We are encouraged by the emerging profile of our CD19 product candidates and we look forward to updating you on progress in this area as well as the rest of our portfolio over the coming quarters.</p>
<p>With that I'll turn it over to Steve to discuss the recent business development activity and second quarter financial results. Steve?</p>
<p><strong>Steve Harr</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Mark. It’s been a productive second quarter and a productive beginning to 2015 and I'm quite pleased with our progress. I’d now like to review some of the key elements. First, I’ll review the strategic rationale for the Celgene partnership, which is transformational for Juno. We believe that there is tremendous potential in our technologies, further advancing our CD19 product candidate and focusing on our pipeline opportunities.</p>
<p>The Celgene partnership is a meaningful bet on our ability to deliver in each of these areas. Our primary focus will be on building our North America commercial capabilities as well as building out and delivering on our pipeline. Celgene provides us with four important pillars of value. First, they give us a world class development in ex-North America commercialization partner. Importantly, this partnership allows us to retain a 100% of North American rights to our CD19 CAR T programs and the vast majority of our pipeline.</p>
<p>Second, Celgene is made available a number of assets that Juno can access through a 70:30 profits split. We are currently evaluating that product candidates and platforms, but we have this option and is worth noting that the deal is structured to incentivize Celgene to add more assets over time. Third, the companies have agreed to collaborate on business development when it makes sense. Given the synergistic skill sets of the two companies and the importance of accessing great science in the rapidly evolving immuno-oncology field, we believe this commitment will be quite valuable for both companies.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve received $1 billion in capital to progress our pipeline and build our capabilities and the company’s share of vision of becoming through our partnership, the leader in immuno-oncology. We also made two acquisitions during the second quarter. The first was stage and I will call Juno GmbH, which we discussed during our first quarter conference call. The second acquisition was X-Body, and I’ll call Juno Boston had occurred later in the quarter. The people and assets we acquired with these transactions add significantly to our capabilities and we’ve already incorporated them into the core of what we do.</p>
<p>Juno GmbH has important capabilities in manipulating cells while they are outside of the body. And there are four areas of value from this transaction. First, we believe that Juno GmbH has a best-in-class cell activation technology that will allow for meaningful improvement in that way we activate and grow cells on our manufacturing process. Second, we acquired best-in-class cell selection capabilities. These technologies are most exploitable on our defined cell products, but one can also see the power and the fact that we could either manufacture cells from a simple blood draw instead of leukophoresis or without growing the cells after transduction of the novel gene. Third, we are making meaningful improvements to our automation technology. And finally, these technologies give us better control of our supply chain and will contribute to the lower cost of goods.</p>
<p>Juno Boston has important capabilities in generating fully human binding domains for our CAR T-cell platform as well as several programs to target intracellular proteins through the MHC peptide complex. Immunogenicity data in both solid organ and hematologic cancers, point to the importance of fully-human scFv’s, which are the radar for our CAR T-cells in maximizing the persistence and clinical benefit of CAR T-cells. It is not as simple as making fully-human antibodies and then utilizing the scFv’s in the CAR T-cell. We believe that strong molecular biology and protein capabilities will be key differentiators and our colleagues in Boston are world-class.</p>
<p>One of the complementary synergies of the acquisitions has been the rapid potential for both of these acquired technologies to grow more quickly working together. We are quite pleased with the progress of integration, as well as the advancing programs from our colleagues in Germany and Boston. We also entered into a number of important licenses and collaborations. Editas gives us access to CRISPR gene-editing capabilities. Gene-editing remains largely un-proven in human studies, but its power and research is unquestioned.</p>
<p>The ex-vivo manufacturing process gives engineered T-cells a nunique capability to push the science [indiscernible] and the ability to manipulate the T-cell genome represents an important step in creating next generation best-in-class drugs. Juno and Editas share a culture and a vision on where to push this science and while the collaboration is early, we are pleased with its progress. The Fate collaboration gives us the potential to manipulate important intracellular pathways in creating better engineered T-cells. Fate has encouraging clinical data in the ex-vivo manipulation of hematopoietic stem cells in patients undergoing a bone marrow transplant. And we believe that at least some of this technology has the potential to be applied to a process of engineered T cells. We’re encouraged by the prospects of this collaboration.</p>
<p>Our clinical collaboration with MedImmune will give us our first experience with combining CAR T-cells with a checkpoint inhibitor, in this case MedImmune’s PDL-1 antibody MEDI4736. We expect to begin a combination trial before the end of the year and it is reasonable to expect preliminary data from this collaboration in 2016. Understanding and overcoming the immunosuppressive effects of the tumor microenvironment may be important in treating B-cell malignancies and we look forward to the data in NHL, the impact may be even larger in solid organ tumors. The combined cash payments for the two acquisitions and the licensing agreements not including the Celgene transaction was $115.7 million.</p>
<p>Finally, we favorably settled our litigation with Novartis and Penn this second quarter. In exchange for licensing, our CD19 4-1BB patent to Novartis, Juno received an initial payment of $12.25 million, and will receive future milestone payments, mid single-digit royalties from U.S. net sales of CD19-Directed Product Candidates that use 4-1BB and a low double-digit percentage of the royalties Novartis pays to Penn for global net sales of these products. Payments received by Juno will be shared with St. Jude under the terms of our license agreement.</p>
<p>I’d now like to review our second quarter financial results. We had $313.4 million in cash and cash equivalents and investments at the end of the second quarter. Pro forma for the Celgene collaboration, our cash and investments position was $1.31 billion or just over $14 per common share outstanding after the transaction. We used cash of $134.2 million in the second quarter of which $77.7 million was net cash paid related to the acquisitions of Stage and X-Body, $38 million was upfront fees to acquire technology in the Editas and Fate collaboration as well as an equity investment Fate. $24 million was operating cash burn and $6.8 million was capital investment. These outflows were offset by cash received in connection with Novartis settlement of $12.25 million, the remainder were changes to our working capital.</p>
<p>Our GAAP net loss for the quarter was $66 million, or $0.79 per share. We use non-GAAP financial measures internally to understand, manage and evaluate our business and make operating decisions. We believe that the presentation of these non-GAAP financial measures is useful to investors because they enhance the ability of investors to compare our results from period to period and allow for greater transparency with respect to the key financial metrics we use in making operating decisions. Please see our press release for reconciliation of our GAAP and non-GAAP results.</p>
<p>Adjustments made from GAAP to non-GAAP in the second quarter of 2015 include the following three areas. First, we excluded the upfront fees to acquire technology. In the second quarter, we incurred upfront fees of $30.8 million in connection with the Fate and Editas collaborations. Second, we exclude the expenses related to our potential success payment liabilities.</p>
<p>We recorded GAAP expense based upon the change in value and the change in accrual period for our potential success payment liabilities as we outlined in detail on our year-end 2014 call. In the second quarter, this amount was $4 million. Third, we exclude non-cash stock-based compensation expense of $1.7 million for the quarter related to the partial vesting of 2013 restricted stock award to a co-founding director who became a consultant upon us departure from Juno’s Board of Directors in 2014.</p>
<p>Our non-GAAP net loss for the quarter was $29.5 million, or $0.35 per share. Our second quarter non-GAAP R&amp;D expense was $23.8 million of which $2.4 million was stock-based compensation. Our GAAP and non-GAAP, general and administrative expenses were $14.9 million for the quarter of which $2.8 million was stock-based compensation.</p>
<p>The second quarter included $6.8 million related to our business development and acquisition activity in the second quarter, basically lawyers and accountants and we do not expect this to recur at this pace going forward unless we see comparable activity. Backing out this cost, our operational run rate was $8 million for the second quarter. Litigation expenses were $5.3 million for the second quarter. These expenses were all occurred in connection with the now resolved litigation discussed earlier on the call.</p>
<p>Turning to our cash burn guidance, we continue to expect cash burn for 2015 excluding cash inflows or outflows from business development activities and the now-settled litigation to be at the higher end of our guidance of between $125 million and $150 million.</p>
<p>I’ll now turn the call back to Hans.</p>
<p><strong>Hans Bishop</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Steve. It’s been a productive quarter. We have made progress in the clinic. We have meaningfully increased our capabilities both internally and via business developments. We have an outstanding partner that can support us developing a broader pipeline and develop our product candidates in rest of the world. And we closed the quarter with over $1.3 billion in our balance sheet. We have a nimble focused organization with resources on hand to complete with competitors of any scale.</p>
<p>So, I’d now like to turn the call over to Q&amp;A and back to Liz.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Cory Kasimov with JPMorgan. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Whitney Ijem</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, this is Whitney on for Cory. Thanks for taking the question. And I guess first you sort of talked about the number of assets that Celgene has thrown into the corral as it’s referred to on the last call. I guess is there any more color you can give us on the types of assets that Celgene has added in there or if not may be just kind of the things that you are looking for an asset that you may opted into?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Daniel</span></strong></p>
<p>Recognizing it’s an important question, Whitney, we have a series of assets that are both technologies as well as product candidates. They’re all early in development. And really in just keeping with the spirit of the collaboration, they're all focused on exploiting the T-cell or other parts of the immune system in treating cancer. And as we evaluate the technologies and as Celgene and we are in a place where they’re ready to be disclosed publicly, we certainly look forward to discussing them in more detail with you going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Hans Bishop</span></strong></p>
<p>And Whitney, this is Hans. What I would add to Steve’s remarks about I think an important way to think about this is not just from which preclinical candidates were the corral. But from a capability perspective what we now have is a partner that as we develop deeper insights into how to manipulate T-cells, obviously we have great expertise in transduce cells of various forms, but for Celgene have capabilities with more molecules and antibodies of various sorts and that really does give us a broader set of technologies to manipulate the insights we come into on biology on T cells.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Whitney Ijem</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. And then in terms of expense ramp I guess you guys talked a lot about sort of accelerating development on the back of the Celgene deal with the capital you got there so, you guys in terms of headcount where are you now and where should we be thinking about that ending up at year-end. And is that more into RNA bucket or R&amp;D bucket – excuse me or the SG&amp;A bucket?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Hans Bishop</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. We're investing significantly across multiple parts of the company and where you – we’ve really spend a lot of time initially. I think we’ve discussed the past with me is in the first building our process development in manufacturing capability, then building out our clinical capabilities and we’ve really been focusing on lay them to our research capabilities. And with the Celgene transaction you should expect all of those areas to continue to ramp and growth. In particular clinical development and research there will be a small increase in G&amp;A to your point just to make sure that we have all the right people in place to leverage what we have.</p>
<p>We currently have around 225 employees. The company continues to grow rapidly both into our capabilities that our size we would expect to end the year somewhere around 300 or bit north of that. As we invest really in particular in getting our manufacturing facility online as we approach year end and in the capabilities that we just talked about.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Harr</span></strong></p>
<p>And I will add, Whitney on top of the numbers which are important, the emphasis we have on quality, nearly 40% of the highest we make in Seattle are coming from out of state which I think showed you our hardly working on getting right people to scaffold and of course now. As a company we have five different sites. So we can take advantage of a location in Boston, as well as one in Europe. And one other things that I haven’t really included we didn’t talk about in the call is of course we are recognized by MITs significant company one of this most comes in U.S. not certainly, gets a lot of attention what candidates are looking to join us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Whitney Ijem</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Matthew Harrison with Morgan Stanley. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi this is Vikram on for Matthew. Just two quick questions. So you touched on both of these topics during the call, but I was wondering if it’s possible to provide more color on one, specifically when the solid tumor targets might be entering the clinic; and two, how long you’d expect enrollment to take on the JCAR015 program?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Gilbert</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, yes, thanks for the question. So in terms of the solid tumor targets we’re pursuing three CARs and one TCRs I noted in the call. And our goal really here is to initiate those once the trials are complete. We’ve made sure both the CMC and the clinical aspects are all ready to move forward. So I can’t really provide any more detail other than kind of the latter part of this year or beginning of next year that those will be initiated. In terms of the JCAR015 trial, that will be initiating soon. And as we said we plan to file the BLA in the latter part of 2016 or early part of 2017. So that would mean enrollment would need to finish kind of in the middle part of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Harr</span></strong></p>
<p>And then I want to add few questions Vikram on enrollment of the JCAR015 study, Mark touched on that fact that we have some very high quality sites that include a meaningful numbers of the biggest leukemia centers in the country. That said our focus is not going to be enrolling this study too quickly. As Mark said we anticipate that we’ll have enrollment finished by the middle of next year, but these are new sites to using CAR T cells and we think the very important factor for making sure we replicate the both promising results we’ve had out at Memorial, just to make sure that those sites as we’re bringing them up are well trained and well supported. And so as we enroll the first part of this study the emphasis on training is going to be a greater focused for us then the medical type of which we are enrolling.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood appreciate that, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of James Kuo with Summer Street. Your line is now open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Kuo</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the questions. You guys announced the collaboration with Editas in late May and highlighted at that time three research programs. We were wondering if you could give us a bit more, I guess, details into areas that research for these three programs and we know it’s early, but when could we potentially see these programs enter to the clinic? And also could you give us a sense of what to expect in upcoming medical meetings in the fall, if there is any new data to be presented, or will this be mainly update to the current ongoing trial? And finally, one housekeeping question. Will the $150 million Celgene upfront be accounted for in the revenue line next quarter or through deferred that with new line and amortized over to the ten-year collaborative period? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Harr</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe I will start with the Editas collaboration. This is Steve. And walk you through also where we are on the accounting policies for Editas. In terms of the areas as you highlighted, there are a number of areas that one can envision utilizing gene-editing to improve next generation CAR T cells and we have highlighted for you, some important areas that we believe likely to drive improved clinical outcomes and those include every things like how long these cells persist, how well they are expand and grow inside the [indiscernible] and include how well you wanted to able to overcome the tumor microenvironment and include things like clinician controlled therapies and we have not yet disclosed what those three areas are but there is flexibility in them as well and part of this is just a resource constraint and the belief of both companies that we can really own three areas at a time.</p>
<p>And we just want to make sure that we have flexibility to move forward with them and change them over time all that being said we’ve been making a tremendous amount of progress in a very short amount of time and we’re quite encouraged by the quality of the work from our Editas partners. In terms when things are come in the clinic higher or market welcome to add to this but my general response is too early to tell and certainly I think we all look forward to seen how well this technology can be utilized across our portfolio and across our platform but it's a bit too early to say.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Hans Bishop</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So we’ve submitted a number of abstracts to ASH it's obviously too early to predict which of those might get accepted but we’re going to expect updates from our major trials in B-cell malignancies. And importantly we’ve been looking to update you on one of these key themes about improving the depth of response that we’ve seen in the non-Hodgkin lymphoma setting and the ALL setting with the use of improved condition therapies.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Gilbert</span></strong></p>
<p>James, I want to touch on our last question on the revenue reorganization of the $150 million upfront payment from Celgene. This is still under evaluation a very clearly, so that we will not recognize at all in the third quarter it will be spread out over the service period.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Kuo</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Gilbert</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Terence Flynn with Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Cameron Bradshaw</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, this is Cameron filling in for Terence. Thanks for taking our question. I was wondering sort of pivotal JCAR015 ALL trial; can you offer any insight into what the bar is for success with respect to response rate and duration of response? What do guys thinking the minimum amount of all awful need to be in order to file? Then finally, can you give us the latest on your strategy for potential EU registration path? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Frohlich</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, yes. This is Mark. So as you may be aware, I mean, the historical response to salvage chemotherapy in the setting is quite poor with response rates kind of in the single-digit or on a low double-digit percentage rate. And survival kind of at one year is in that kind of 10% to 15% range. So the bar is quite low. And we know from the experience with blinotumomab is approved with the complete remission rate on the order of 40%. So, I think anything northward of kind of the 20% range, I think, would be reasonable. And obviously with a reasonable durability response, but I think overall survival is probably a better predictor of that.</p>
<p>In terms of the follow-ups that will be needed, we’ve recently made the decision to increase the duration of follow-up after the last patient to six months, which is why, as Hans noted, I think that it's a stretch goal for filing the BLA by late 2016 and perhaps more likely early 2017. In terms of our EU strategy, I think that’s still in discussions. With our recent collaboration with Celgene, we’ll be interested in talking with our partners there about what the right strategy is to move to the EU.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Hans Bishop</span></strong></p>
<p>And Cameron another point I’d add. As Mark said, the primary endpoint on which FDA will approve therapies like this will be the complete remission rate of 30 days, using the standard accepted measure of using light microscopy. But as Mark commented on during his prepared remarks, there is good evidence in the field generally and by the way confirmed now specifically with CAR trials that the complete molecular remission rate is a very, very important measure.</p>
<p>We can clearly correlate the likelihood of having a durable response. You’ve seen the Kaplan-Meier plots from our CAR T trials, encouragingly in this adult population 30% to 40% of the patients appear to be after 12 months on the stable plateau. And the likelihood of getting that plateau is very correlated to the depth of response. And a complete molecular remission by flow or even better still by the way deep sequencing is a better measure. And so, we will be following those data in our trial and our other leukemia trials very closely because we think they’re very important marker of future improved overall survival.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Tony Butler with Guggenheim. Your line is now open, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tony Butler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you very much. So the question is actually three-folded if I may. Number one of the 14 clinical sites for JCAR015 trial, can you provide some color – would you be willing to provide some color on how you’re going to stage those, for example, how many may be opened by year-end or some other facts similarly to that recognizing that you’re going to take your time as Hans alluded to earlier. That’s number one.</p>
<p>I’ll go ahead and recite the other two. The second is really around JCAR015 itself the product. And are you satisfied currently with what you have in place in order to satisfy the requirements for the process of taking patient cells and manipulating them, and then sending them back or does that still need some modification?</p>
<p>And then the third question for housekeeping, it’s really around the notion of the success payments to purchase of Memorial Sloan Kettering. The Celgene collaboration change that in anyway, does it increase the timing of when payments need to be paid back and/or the overall amount at a specific time? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Harr</span></strong></p>
<p>Very good Tony, thank you. Mark will take the question on site, so I’ll take the question on the process and I’ll hand over to Steve then to talk about the success payments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Frohlich</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, in terms of staging of the sites I can’t give you specific numbers, but as Hans noted, I think priority here is to ensure safety for patients as we rollout this novel therapies to these clinical sites, some of them don’t have a lot of experience with cellular therapies. So, we’ll be making sure each site can enroll one patient that we follow that patient to 30 days, before they enroll a subsequent patient. There is an intensive program in place for education of the sites ensuring that there is a cross functional team including the clinical service, the ICU service, neurology service they can address patients who they run into any toxicities.</p>
<p>So I think you can expect that you will see a carefully stage process if you enroll these slow initially, but then once patients are treated, it’s a single patient that will ramp quickly thereafter. And we will share what the clinical sites are as they become available through clinicaltrials.gov, but they include some of the largest leukemia centers. So we expect that their capacity to enroll once they’ve gotten to that initial Fate should be quite good.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Harr</span></strong></p>
<p>And Tony to your question about the manufacturing and distribution process, so we’re basically moving forward with our promotion process. The shipping containers we’re going to use, the logistics behind all of that, the equipment we use, the one change that we’ll be looking to make frankly across our portfolio of clinical candidates will be integration of this Fate reagents. We think we have an important opportunity to put ex-promoters into all of our clinical candidates including JCAR015. Other than that change, everything we’re using is consistent with our current process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Hans Bishop</span></strong></p>
<p>Finally to the success payments, there is no change. If you want more detail, it is in the 10-K or the S-1. But in summary, the four events that trigger an evaluation are one-year post our IPO. The sale of over 50% of the Series A ownership from either Alaska or ARCH of Series A investors, a change of control over the end of the term period.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tony Butler</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Steve. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Hans Bishop</span></strong></p>
<p>Very good, we have time for one more question operator.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our last question comes from the line of Jason McCarthy with Maxim Group. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jason McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, guys. Everything sounds like it’s going really well. Thank you for taking my question. So I just kind of want to drift out to next generation CARs and TCRs. So my question is when do you anticipate CAR and TCR candidates will be announced that are really utilizing the CRISPR or Cas9 gene editing platform, can you share some thoughts that the gene editing will be applied beyond things like costimulatory domains because it seems that when dealing with or approaching solid tumors of any kind or even considering homing, targeting, and safety, multiple genes are going to have to be all cleared. Could you just kind of give me your thoughts and eventually some guidance on what you’re thinking and utilizing that gene editing technology?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Hy Levitsky</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure. This is Hy Levitsky. I think first of all to mirror what Steve said earlier, the Editas collaboration is in full throttle at the research stage. That being said I think it’s still early days in terms of the defining which of the many targets that we’re looking at are our best position to go forward. Suffice it to say that that genetically modification – other forms of genetic modification of the cells such as the introduction of the cytokine IL-12 or potentially 4-1BB ligand are very much teed up or in the preparation stages for launching. So as the overall concept of T cell gene-editing get large is really very much upon us. The more selective question of eliminating or modifying or substituting genes that the Editas collaboration allows us to pursue what’s going to require the biology to dictate itself in terms of the best path forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jason McCarthy</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Hans Bishop</strong></p>
<p>Well, thank you for joining the call today and we look forward to reporting on our continued progress.</p>
