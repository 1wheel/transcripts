<p><strong>Lyle Jensen</strong></p>
<p>Okay, Chuck. Thank you. Good morning everyone and thanks for participating in this morning’s investor conference call. Our call is being held to coincide with the disclosure of our fiscal 2015 third quarter results released this morning. For those who have not seen the release or the financial statements, they were distributed to all wire services and can be found on the Internet and APG’s website.</p>
<p>I want to begin this morning’s phone call with a sincere thank you to a key group of shareholders and investors who are members or affiliated with members of our APG Board of Directors. Since our last investor conference call, they have arranged equity and project lease financing totaling $5.8 million, which helps facilitate yesterday’s announcement of our new vertically integrated revenue stream as well as giving us the staying power to adjust to today’s volatile oil and diesel market. So, I am happy to communicate this shared vision our Board members and strategic investors have for APG.</p>
<p>We know that just working hard to position for the future while we wait for an increase in oil and diesel prices is no longer a sustainable business strategy. APG now believes we will experience unstable oil and diesel pricing for a much longer period of time than the energy experts were projecting just 90 days ago when we were in the middle of a mini rally that turned out not to be sustainable.</p>
<p>As you’ve seen from our March and June results, there is no doubt APG has taken some hard punches this year in sales and this put us on the ropes where we continue to stand to fight on. Unfortunately several of our key dual fuel competitors appear not be so fortunate; they are down for the count and it’s questionable whether they will get back up. So, in light of these market realities, we’ve reduced headcount; we’ve cut our key marketing costs; we’re wrapping up -- only have one more EPA approval we want to do which has been a substantial cash burn here over the past three or four years; and we’re fine tuning our future energies to really -- the following three key attributes and initiatives that we believe now can sustain itself regardless of what happens to the oil and the diesel pricing.</p>
<p>Our first initiative is our value add proposition is going to be more about expanding the regulatory adoption of our mission reduction programs, both at the state and the federal level. We continue to be at the forefront, both technically and practically with the -- with our Turbocharged Natural Gas dual fuel technology, can reduce diesel emissions and as of yesterday, now we have a Trident NGL Flare to Fuel technology that can reduce the flared gas emissions. So, we’re seeing -- mostly from a vehicular standpoint versus stationary, but we’re seeing our dual fuel solutions being written into more eligible emission reduction programs, both at the state and federal level; grounds are being provided and all these really point towards customer -- improved customer payback. Other regulators are picking up on what other states are doing. And overall with this emphasis on reducing greenhouse gases all the way from the president to state level, we definitely benefit the environment regardless of the price of diesel.</p>
<p>Some examples that we continue to expand upon: As of last Friday, we achieved our EPA testing, both at the EPA federal level and at the California CARB level. The most popular engine out there for the new model years, the Cummins ISX, past last week, that will give us another 20, 25 plus engine approvals on the federal level which will put us over 500 approvals. And more importantly, it gives us the third family that we will be submitting to California CARB for their search, which will give California Volvo engines, Mack engines, Detroit Diesel engines and Cummins ISX engines to launch in California. So, these approvals truly will be -- as we look back over time, these will be the lifeline of getting into our regulatory adoption programs that we see as they are so important.</p>
<p>We’ve had -- with our recent approvals in California; we’re getting a lot more interest in California. They have a lot of non-attainment areas which means they still have heavy emissions. We’ve proven through our EPA testing that our, what’s called nitrous oxide or NOx, which is one of the major emissions of diesel fuel, we’ve seen -- they have seen what we can do in reducing that, both on, not only the newer engines but the older engines. And we pointed out in the recent presentation that over 60% of all the Class A trucks on the road today are 2006 and older. And our results from independent lab results show that we can continue to reduce nitrous oxide 12,000 to 14,000 pounds per every million miles driven which is a number that nobody really understood. And I think we’re going to get some nice traction in California with our approvals as well as their NOx reduction programs.</p>
<p>Governor just came out here a couple of weeks ago and has made an edict that he wants to reduce diesel and gasoline consumption by 50% by the year 2030. We sit here today at least on the Class A trucks and every single day can reduce diesel consumption by 50% to 60% on those diesel trucks. So, we’re just a small part of what their solution can be but it can be a key solution we think we will be granted opportunities to expand our program there.</p>
<p>Last week, State of Virginia opened up a new program for their -- they have five ports call on the East Coast and they provided a $6,000 credit on dual fuel conversions and $20,000 credits for dedicated and new dual fuel glider trucks. So that’s a huge opportunity to -- as we’re now working the fleets in Virginia that take some services in and out of those five ports. And that’s a program that again literally just has happened this month. Nebraska has also just announced the dual fuel and natural gas conversion program credit for the State of Nebraska. They’ve invited us to highlight the dual fuel capability at the Nebraska Truck Association Annual Conference here, coming in September. And we just booked our first two fleets in Nebraska and have sold five test systems into two different fleets there.</p>
<p>Department of Energy for the first time is asking for grant applications on dual fuel testing, which we believe now they’re at least concerning at for the first time. And I guess finally, last Friday, we were at corporate headquarters one of the top two truck rental companies in the world and gave them the status of our California approvals as well as our 2010 to 2013 engine models and we walked out the door with the handshake that we’re going to start to co-marketing program where as they have their trucks come off lease which are the 2010, 2011, 2012 are the model years that coming off lease that we will co-market dual fuel solution for those to give -- people that are buying used trucks, give them the opportunity to buy a dual fuel truck with a very, very incredible company where these diesel trucks have been outstanding in their performance and their maintenance records.</p>
<p>So, those I think are key initiatives that we continue to expand upon. And with having the most approvals and having credibility in the field, this is a key area that we can grow in, despite the oil prices.</p>
<p>Our second initiative is to work the niches. Right now the negative price spread is not universal across all customers and markets. We have pulled back from our mass adoption initiative that we’ve talked about because of the hesitation on lack of price spread. But as we look, we still have very specific international countries where the government controls the price spread and continues to be favorable and we have other vehicular niches like the dual fuel glider which we expect next year we’re -- pastured right now to see 300% to 400% increase in our volume next year on dual fuel gliders.</p>
<p>So, couple of examples: Peru, we just passed our testing on diesel port stackers which -- there are the machines that move all the containers around a port. We’ve successfully converted. They now have got approval to haul natural gas into these ports which happened just this month. And we just met with them a week ago and they’re expecting to triple their volume in 2016, both on the port stackers as well as moving into the Class A trucks. So that appears to be a good start.</p>
<p>We’ve talked over this last year secondly about one of the largest international building materials companies around the world and we’ve focused on Latin America. We currently will be installing dual fuel on 40 cement mixers in the Dominican for them. We’ve just finished doing six conversions for them in Mexico which all have been successful. And we continue to talk about potential worldwide dual fuel conversion program for this company as they see some excellent fuel savings in all of Latin America.</p>
<p>We also just sold five dual fuel systems in September to a large Mexican beverage company that again will test here for the rest of this year. But in Mexico there is a good price spread and we’re seeing a lot of activity and lot of interest for dual fuel where they want the ability to be able to go back to diesel if possible.</p>
<p>About a year ago, in Colombia, we actually announced the Cummins dealer down there wanting to do dual fuel for us. And almost the same month, we announced the government of Colombia came out with a new natural gas component certification program. And so, we worked on that this year. And we -- literally on the last two components, testing is done; paper work has been submitted; and same type of thing, positive price spread in Colombia. And we expect to be able to launch here this fall.</p>
<p>Other recent approvals are in Canada, British Columbia which is really a key -- both British Columbia and Quebec I shouldn’t minimize Quebec, so both West Coast and the East Coast provinces. We’ve got demo starting in British Columbia next week. And more importantly, as importantly in British Columbia and Alberta, we have Fortis which is the largest natural gas company in Canada is issued a grant program for dual fuel programs that we have helped our dealer there submit the application which will benefit in customers -- and in Canada, they are allowed to haul much, much heavier loads. And that’s again, the perfect spot for our dual fuel solution as on these heavy loads.</p>
<p>So, that looks well and Canada been able to kick-off Canada. And then lastly Harrison, the dual fuel gliders that worry about the on-road and the severe-duty, we again announced that in February, we’ve had a good marketing program through the spring and the summer. There is a lead time on new trucks, our new glider trucks when they come in there is -- takes 12 to 18 week lead time to actually get them in line to start to be able to dual fuel. So, we’re seeing that happen. We won a very critical run-off against dedicated natural gas and a coal mine that’s looking at over 100 trucks in the next 12 to 18 months. We’re expecting or have been told verbally our first release will come in October. The trucks, the glider trucks for those have been ordered months ago and are starting to -- will start to hit in the October, November time period.</p>
<p>And we truly believe that we’re going to see our glider business go from 20 trucks this year to 100, 100 plus in 2016. And that’s one again where the fuel savings is important, but the glider truck has less maintenance costs that has or doesn’t need or require DES fluid. So, there is other economic aspects of dual fuel glider. It’s lighter in weight whilst our number one customer that hauls dry goods for people like General Mills. They have contacted us and said that they’ve budgeted, again another big order for 2016 and -- but they are driven by weight where they can -- they have their own inside defense fuel station. So, they are not subject to public pump pricing, but they also have the weight advantage and that will be again dual fuel gliders. So that’s -- those are some of the niches that we will actually just focus on those and let the mass adoption initiatives wait for any eventual comeback in the price spread.</p>
<p>Lastly, we’ll spend most of today’s call discussing the new vertical integrated revenue stream we announced yesterday that gives APG a large new market. And it’s -- from my standpoint, I love it because it’s anchored and it’s got regulatory deadlines, it’s got environmental benefits and it’s got economic growth as a first to market opportunity. So, the reason we got into it, really goes back, really over a last four years. And we’ve discussed over previous phone calls over 85% of our North America oil rate conversions have been operating on condition wellhead gas all this time. And we started in Oklahoma and Texas; from there, we moved to Pennsylvania into the Marcellus; from there, we move to DJ Basin in Colorado and then we went to Western Canada. But the one oil patch that we never thought was ready was the Bakken region or Dakota and the last one to enter. And they had to do because they have got an unconventional high Btu wellhead gas that is hotter than any other gas around North America.</p>
<p>And we’ve been kind of waiting and watching. We’ve talked about we do have rigs now operating on the Bakken gas, but it is still too hot and we’ve not seen any opportunity, which we thought we had a year ago watching a lot of different technologies. But they were able to produce a pipeline quality gas that we could be able to use in vehicular application. So, we’ve been watching and monitoring several different technologies here over the last two years that could crack the code on this high Btu gas. And then we finally have focused on Trident Resources which we believe has the best high Btu process technology. And as we, began our discussions, it was to try do joint ventures and work together. Ultimately we decided it was better to join forces and fund the expansion of their mobile natural gas liquids process system. And we’ll talk about their focuses on the mobile and modular solution for the remote and stranded which we’ll explain here in a minute.</p>
<p>So, as we announced yesterday, we signed the license agreement of Trident that gives us a exclusive worldwide right to commercialize their property natural gas liquid which is called NGL is kind of how it’s known in the industry, is the acronym but it’s the NGL processing technology. </p>
<p>In addition, we purchased Trident’s two existing mobile NGL operating systems which are currently in operation, producing revenue every day and they service several remote and stranded sites for one of the top five E&amp;P companies in the Bakken region. On top of that, we’ve also, as a part of our announcement, we’ve secured financing through our Board members and affiliates of our Board members for project lease financing. And we will begin immediately to order parts to build two additional NGL operating systems, one of those will be the first NGL system that will be capable of converting this hot flared gas into a premium quality natural gas and then we’ll be able to use that locally for all of our APG dual fuel stationary and vehicular applications.</p>
<p>This acquisition is forecast to be incrementally accretive from both the revenue and profitability standpoint and definitely positions us in a different aspect. Even though it might be a regional one, it gives us an opportunity to take a vertical step into an integrated alternative energy solution where we can provide, both fuel reprocess, recaptured fuel as well as the benefits of our dual fuel system.</p>
<p>So, let’s take a minute and talk about what is natural gas liquids market. Some of you that are in the oil and gas industry, as you know, the NGL market is a well-known market that is tracked, both large and small. And so, let’s talk about what that market is and how Triden’ts process fits into it from a niche standpoint.</p>
<p>So, start with the basics. When oil is extracted from the shale, there is a mixture of hydrocarbons and things like methane and ethane and propane and butane and other heavy gases, they come up to the surface; reach well site as you bring up the well extraction. For those that remember Chemistry 101, if you apply pressure in cold temperatures to any gas, you can always find the point of transition where you can covert a gas to a liquid. And that’s what this process of what’s called natural gas liquids, NGL, it really is that process where you take a gas and you apply pressure and you apply the appropriate cold temperatures and you can isolate and separate and actually create fluids that actually have an end market application.</p>
<p>So for example, if on methane -- we try to grab that for natural gas fueling. Ethanes can be made into ethylene for plastics, so that goes into plastic bags and antifreeze. Propane we all know goes into home heating for the LPG market. Butanes can be liquefied; they go into synthetic rubber tires, used for lighter fluid. And then your heavier gases tend to be once that are put into gasoline and ethanol blends or they are used for emulsifiers.</p>
<p>So, there is good commercial end-markets, if you have the appropriate technology to handle these gases as they come up to atmosphere at the world site. So, there is really two paths that these combined gases can go. The majority of them go down a path where they’re gathered in their own separate pipeline. And this pipeline will network itself to -- basically at some place there is going to be a midstream processing company that will take this gas and they will go ahead through pressure and temperatures and they will separate it and into its constituents and be able to monetize the gas. So, there is the majority -- it depends on where you’re at but it can be anywhere from 80% to 90% of -- most gases can be -- are being captured through a pipeline.</p>
<p>But the second path becomes again where the gases flared to atmosphere. And there is really two major areas where this happens and that’s where the gas gathering infrastructure; it’s too far away. So, you have what’s called remote sites. And also there are situations where the well sites maybe on a gathering system but the pipe itself is already at capacity and it’s insufficient to handle any more volume of gas. And those are called stranded well sites. So, this becomes a niche or a subset of the total NGL market. But typically, historically remote and stranded sites have always flared their gas.</p>
<p>These two situations now are coming under increasing regulatory requirements across the United States, but specifically much stronger requirements in the Bakken because they were allowed to flare as recently as 2011. I think they were flaring almost -- they only captured 64% of everything and everything else went to atmosphere and that now is tightening up. It has to the 85% by January 1 of 2016 and by 90% by January 1 of 2020. So, we got this new emerging market of the remote and stranded well sites that for sure in the Bakken and as well as across the United States we hear in Marcellus also where they need to be able to capture these gases. And that’s going to call for some type of mobile modular system because it’s got a mobile to move from site-to-site or it’s going to be able to adjust to where the sites are that need to be captured.</p>
<p>So, we know that in the Bakken -- right now I was just at a conference and they just reported that just little under 20% of all of the 13,000 well sites in the Bakken are still flaring their gas with almost all of those being remote or stranded well sites. As we have done our homework and our due diligence, as we look across America, we know there is thousands. We’re getting interest from the Marcellus. We’ve had some phone calls already from the Eagle Ford. So, we take a look that we know there is 2,500 for sure that we actually -- can actually touch and fuel those. And then as we start to market this beyond the Bakken someday, after Phase 1, we will truly be able to dial-in on just how many there are.</p>
<p>If you take a look at an average well site -- and it depends on the number of well heads on a site; they can arrange anywhere from just one frac well site to two to three to -- we’ve seen as -- I’ve seen as many as six or seven. So that really has -- that’s where the E&amp;P company and their geological research is determined, how much they want to put on a well site. So, it ranges. But on average -- and I guess there is such a thing as an average one of these well sites that might have one or two or three producing wells. They are producing 1 million to 2 million cubic feet of flared gas per day. And that gas can be -- again, captured; it can be compressed and liquefied. And right now through chemistry, we can prove that it produces several million gallons of the -- what’s called the natural gas liquids. And we also know because of our experience in natural gas that we can probably produce close to 1 million equivalent gallons of natural gas per year on an annual basis from each one of these sites.</p>
<p>So, you start adding up 2,500 for the Bakken and add I don’t know, pick, easy enough say 2,500 for everybody else this -- you start adding this up and this can become a very large market that has to be addressed. And again, what I like about it is it’s a regulatory market that’s being driven. The option to the E&amp;P guys is not a good option; it’s either improve your capture rate or we will choke down your daily output of oil to a level that’s very painful. So, they have a barrel per day restriction if they have to report on their flare, capture every single month. And if they are not in compliance with the guidelines, this year -- there were guidelines this year. There were some hand slaps but nothing really serious by next year. We’ve been told by the regulatory people and our due diligence that they will be much more serious next year with their 85% capture in 2016. And again, it will hurt badly to take operating well and be able to shut it down to a very low level till they become compliant.</p>
<p>So that’s really the motivation as we’re providing a solution for these E&amp;P customers. They’re handling, putting new sites on the pipeline infrastructure where they can. But you start adding up four, five or six different remote sites and have a 100% flare, those numbers then make it difficult for these E&amp;P companies to meet their overall numbers. And people like Trident Resources, has the technology solution that can allow these people to meet their regulatory requirements and go from there.</p>
<p>So from that standpoint, as we take a look, currently as we did our due diligence, most of the mobile processing technology can only capture 70%, 75% of the total flair. That’s below the limits I just talked about of 85%, 90%. The technology that Trident has, they’ve licensed, both our standard technology in geo configuration but also the one that we were most interested in as the latest proprietary one where their new compression in refrigeration process is intended to meet the 90%, the 20-20 capture rate we should be able to meet that in 2016 as opposed waiting the years for everybody else to catch up.</p>
<p>So with that process, it’s really the new process that will get us to the premium quality natural gas that we can use for our dual fuel operations both stationary as well as dual fuel. Both of these versions are -- again, are constructed on mobile skids; they’re modular and they’re either on skids or trailers and they’re being able to move around from site to site. One of the variables that we deal with is, is that until you actually start at site and see where it’s actually at especially a new site, nobody really knows the volume of oil and the volume of gas that’s going to be buying from a location.</p>
<p>So, what we’re looking at it is, we will probably have two configuration size -- I guess sized configurations for sure and maybe a third because in a typical well profile if that’s what it’s called, so decline rate where it will start very, very strong and you’ll have very high gas -- very oil production, very high gas production for the first three or four months and then they have what they call a decline rate which then will move the output down. And so, you don’t want to spend millions of dollars overcapacity your mobile facility. So, we’re doing a modular approach. So that potentially on a new customer site, you may put two modules on it for the first three or four months and then maybe at some point in time as the decline rate settles in, you will be able to know exactly where it is.</p>
<p>So, there will be a couple of different sizes of NGL processors that we construct. Somebody was asking about price that’s really proprietary but we can tell you that there could be $1 million for the small ones; there could be well over $2 million for the large ones. And it really depends as we talk to our existing customers as well as new customers exactly what configuration. But if we do -- keep it standardized and do the best fit, we can actually handle almost any scenario that comes up for the remote and the stranded well sites.</p>
<p>From where we’re going to start, again obviously, as I think that make sense that we’re definitely going to start in the Bakken but from there we’ve already had people calling us from Marcellus and Texas, as I mentioned. And eventually this could be a solution for other places around the world that are still dealing with or want to deal with their flared gas issues.</p>
<p>The marking operations of the NGL service division has already been integrated into our current APG organization. We’ve actually been co-operating the two sites with Trident people for the last 30 days and have a good -- a lot of our stationary checks and our engineers will move over into supporting this NGL services division.</p>
<p>As far as what can you do? So, we talked about the end end-market, but obviously we sell into a middle market. So, the NGL fluids, they can be sold into heating, to emulsifiers and then we sell to the midstream people. It’s actually a combined liquid that’s called Y Grade that keeps it together. And then we sell it to these midstream companies and they take it on a volume basis. And they can break it down into its various pieces.</p>
<p>There is seasonality to it. Obviously with -- since there is propane in it, as you guys well know, propane is -- goes up in the winter with home heating; goes down in the summer. And the butanes and natural gases also have got some seasonality to them. So, we’ve been able to plan on that. We’ll take a look to see where the best use is. But currently our strategy is we’ll continue to sell these NGLs into the end markets, discussed. And really our focus is getting these two new units built, 12 to 14 week lead time on parts, maybe couple of weeks -- three or four weeks to put it together. So, we’re really looking towards the November, December time period of having our new unit that can -- so we can start to enter 2016, will start to be able to sell the -- we’re looking right now at wholesale. CNG will be our first step where we will take this gas, will compress it and we’ll work with local transportation companies in the Bakken as well as be it call it metered dispenser companies that can either put dispensing systems inside the fence onsite or we have already couple of meetings coming up with people that have public diesel stations in the area that maybe able to put in a CNG station with quality natural gas.</p>
<p>So, those will be areas that we’ll be able to enjoy for at least a couple of months here, the existing revenue of the two sites and then look towards bringing on the new sites here for ‘16.</p>
<p>Right now, if we take a look at it, we’re forecasting in the next 12 months between the units we want to deploy that will be $5 million to $10 million increase in revenue. We had a lot of good phone call -- or a lot of good questions yesterday, what are the first two; exactly how much is it; how profitably are they? And so, I want to do at least on today’s call, talk about -- for those of you guys that are in or around the oil and gas industry, for past 200 years, it’s always been a well-kept secret on what is the output of a specific well, so that so many competitors come in and drill next to you and steal what’s in the hole. So, we signed -- we have very strict NDAs on -- and we won’t be able to talk about strategic or specific site-to-site output and profitability. But I can at least for those that asked the question, I can give you this kind of a general guideline here and that’s if you take a look at the NGL market, there is a very recognized and reputable service called OPIS, which is the oil price information service. And OPIS tracks both existing and future pricing on all of these different NGL liquids and has really become the basis for a lot of people being able to sell it.</p>
<p>So, there is a good indexing of what’s going on in all of these different markets that’s tracked religiously everyday but they range all over the place. So, propane is right now -- can be as low as $0.25 a gallon plus or minus, butanes are less than $0.50, some of the natural gas, the heaviers can sell less than a $1. So, if you want to -- and then we know that natural gas and its wholesale basis is going to be $0.75 to less than a $1. So, those are things that we can apply to -- every site is different as far as what their volume is going to be per site.</p>
<p>But if we go back to that 1 million to 2 million gallons I talked about of NGLs, it’s $0.50 that could be $0.5 million to $1 million per site. And those sites that we add the CNG capability to at 1 million gallons a year times $0.75, so that be another three quarters of the 1 million. So, we think as we go forward and we take a look and as we bring this newer process technology that 1 million, 1.2 million to 1.5 million is going to be per site -- per average site is going to be a reasonable range of revenue that can be generated with each pod, that -- mobile pod that we put together.</p>
<p>In addition to the -- we’re going to pick up these two new revenue streams, both the NGL liquids as well as the CNG, so there will be two new legs to our revenue stream that we have. But recently we’ve started on this two years ago was to again try to get to the thousands of trucks and specifically in the Bakken that service the oil and gas industry. Number one, they need us because they pull heavy loads with sand and the water trucks and so forth. This year we announced Harrison Truck Center and has taken upon themselves to design the first severe-duty dual fuel truck that they’re putting up there to handle the -- the tri-axel to handle the heavy loads. So, we bring the fuel to those people. This is on top of the additional revenue streams we have. There is just a significant opportunity to now convert the trucks up there that support because they need the high horsepower and they can give us the savings.</p>
<p>So, these operators can do two things for their -- their customer is the E&amp;P customer and they can do two things. The can -- everybody now -- again, I presented here a couple of weeks ago in cost savings, cost cutting alter the penny or whatever, all those are very, very important to everybody now. So, any fleet can cut their fuel costs to the E&amp;P or going to get an increased market share. And then secondly, we’ll give them the credit that they helped consume some of this natural gas that we’ve been able to produce.</p>
<p>So from our standpoint, even though our -- if 55% of all the new rigs have been idled and it really has -- it’s cut our revenue, our historical revenue stream has been severely cut back on new digs. But the beauty of this is you got 2,500 wells up there that really don’t care what the price is. You can’t shut -- you can shut down drilling for new wells which a lot of people have done, as we all know. But once you get one up and running, it’s very expensive and/or even operationally if you ever try to choke it or shut it down, when you try to open it back up, it’s not near as efficient. And everything today is about efficiency.</p>
<p>It is amazing. Even in today’s world, it seems like the fractionation technology is getting more efficient. They’re getting more levels per day. They’re getting more output. And so, it’s all about efficiency, all about cost. And here we are. We can bring a technology, to these E&amp;P guys, that helps them with the regulations, the regulatory requirements, so they don’t have to reduce their oil output. So, they are actually helping the environment and the economics of keeping a peak production; with lower fuel cost, it’s really a nice integrated pitch of it tries to go.</p>
<p>So, we’re truly excited about this new venture. If we take a look, again, they drew some presentations out at the Bakken Conference. So, there is roughly 13,000 wells right now today in operation in the Bakken which really -- is really just the western part of North Dakota and stretches in a little bit into Montana but they got up and projected that over the next decade that 13,000 wells will end up somewhere between 50,000 and 70,000 wells. So they’re still showing a tremendous growth in what the expected well sites will be.</p>
<p>I was flying to the West Coast yesterday and read the Bakken -- what’s called the Bakken Magazine News. And EOG must have had a press release because they talked about industry analysts comments but they came up yesterday talking about that originally they thought that the Bakken would be worth about 420 million barrels in their total build-out. And as of yesterday now, they believe that that’s going to be -- that will approach roughly 1 billion barrels. So, they’re going to increase their projected output of the Bakken by 2.5 times. They talked about that roughly they’ve got -- had planned roughly 580 new sites. They now went public yesterday; they’re talking about that could be 1,500 new sites. And the theme of that was basically that the Bakken continues to exceed their expectation.</p>
<p>So anyway, here is -- there is a lot of stories, potentially we’re liking EOG up there that either exist for us today or that we’ll be talking to tomorrow. And then on top of that as we have success up there, we have other areas like I said in the Marcellus and the Eagle Ford and even the DJ Basin and Colorado where you just -- it’s truly physically impossible to have effective pipeline infrastructure; in some cases, the cost of a pipeline infrastructure per mile is cost prohibitive if they have the ability to work with somebody like APG, Trident and be able to pull their flare and get it offsite to give them the credit they need.</p>
<p>So anyway, we’re glad that we were able to pull this together. It’s a continuation of our -- again, all of our oil and gas relationships that we have. We can give them some new solutions that they didn’t have in the past. And we’ll see that side of our business pick back up here in the next couple of quarters.</p>
<p>And again, by getting four systems operational by January, February and March of next year, that’s really what starts to make a difference where you can leverage your fixed cost. But today, it does create positive cash flow in itself just for the two units. But again, two units alone, isn’t all that exciting from extension standpoint. And we need to -- we’re looking forward with this first phase of getting all these done and being able to start to actually sell the CNG. And then I think you’ll see this take off in ‘16. And we see this a long, long -- a very long-term opportunity for APG and its shareholders.</p>
<p>So with that, I will turn it over to our Q&amp;A session.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And we’ll go first to Ross Kaminski, [ph] a private investor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Congratulations for getting this done. I think it’s a remarkable thing that you’ve accomplished. I wanted to ask you whether you’ve heard from any of the folks up there in the Bakken whether they see this technology as important enough that at least if oil prices recover little bit that it might encourage them to create more stranded wells, so called stranded wells that they otherwise might not. I am trying to gather how -- sense of significant the locals think this is?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>The local side, I guess we’re only as smart right now as the state officials and the half a dozen E&amp;P companies that we’ve talked to in our due diligence. And it’s -- I mean it is kind of the number issue on everybody’s mind because of regardless of the price, where the price goes, every gallon that gets cut back today on existing wells, really hurts the efficiency. So, this 85% regulatory requirement on January ‘16 is on everybody’s mind. And I think what we see is and why we think this is so perfectly timed is, is that again, literally it wasn’t only three years ago that they only had 64% capture and now they have to be at 85%.</p>
<p>So, we’re catching. They are finally waking up their remote and stranded sites, are going to hurt their overall total reported average. And so we see -- again, we see -- there is at least three or four processing companies that are up there, but it’s a -- we’re not going to give out all the competitive secrets, but I’ll tell you this has a lot to do with the combination of pressure and going to colder temperatures that the current people are not doing up there. And we believe much like we did in our dual fuel where the way you design it upfront, it’s going to have longevity, value to it, we believe that being able to come out with a system that can handle 90% day one. It’s a much tighter process control and it’s more sophisticated and then to be able to modularize that. I think we’re at the right place at the right time. And like I said, these 25, you take a look at going from 13,000 to 50,000.</p>
<p>Today, I can’t tell you today how many of those will be remote or stranded but the -- we did pick up from the North Dakota Pipeline Authority that almost half of those well sites are stranded, meaning they are on pipeline infrastructure that is already at capacity and they can’t do anything with them. And you can’t come in and go replace thousands of miles of existing pipeline. So, I guess one of the advantages for us is that as we just said and as EOG just announced yesterday, there is more gas up there than anybody ever thought. And so, they basically, unfortunately have designed an infrastructure that is already at capacity and this will get all this growth [ph] to go. Now, they will add more pipeline. There is no doubt about it. But if we can -- there is always going to be 15% to 20% stranded wellhead complement up there. It’s just a large business that has to be -- it’s got be handled or they get chocked back.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And is our technology good enough it’s arguable to say you don’t even need to spend the money on pipeline out to such interest wellhead, if you’re using more stuff?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, the mile -- I mean what the E&amp;P guys is going to do, he is going to do the cost per pipeline versus working with us to make his problem go away, absolutely.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And the last question for you, just to make sure I’m understanding the business models right. In terms of comparing this business versus the dual fuel business, it seems to me lower oil prices kind of hurt both but they work in opposite direction with natural gas prices, like I guess in -- with dual fuel, we don’t want higher natural gas prices but with this new business we do want higher natural gas prices. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Good. Yes and no. I mean really what we want is a good price spread. So, I think with all of the natural gas everybody is finding, we would prefer natural gas not to go up. But yet, if does, probably to answer, I should say it this way. The NGLs probably follow -- historically they followed the oil and gas market. And we’re actually -- in our mind, we love this model because it’s profitable today. And if you take a look at the last 10 years of NGL prices just like oil, we tend to be almost at the bottom and everybody -- we are not everybody but the experts that follow NGL that I’ve been able to present to the Board and the investors, everybody is talking about anywhere from 10% to 30% increase in NGL pricing over the next 24 months.</p>
<p>So, from our standpoint, both benefit us. But again, dual fuel clearly needs a price spread between diesel and natural gas to -- if you’re going to do it only on price. Where we’re headed right now is as I talked this morning, we’re headed down -- we are only going to focus on states where they’re giving out grants and tax incentives for adopting natural gas And we’ve got to -- even though it’s nice to educate the world, sometimes we spend thousands of dollars on a national show to promote the technology and talk about our EPA approvals. But it really doesn’t get to the heart and the home of -- doesn’t really work. So we’re now focused much more on local, state level. Even given, like I said, this larger truck rental company, they made it very clear. They presented their list and there is only so many states in the United States that they will focus on because that’s what helps on the payback. So, we’re getting very focused on states that really care about this but are allowing, -- we always save money. Even in today’s price spread, you can save money by converting but it’s been the payback months that make a difference. So, you can like Virginia, if you get $6,000 off that’s more than half of the price of our system gets financed. $20,000 for a new dual fuel glider, almost comes close to paying for almost 70% of the tanks and the system. So, these are the states that we’ll focus on and work despite what the price spread is.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chuck Coppa</span></strong></p>
<p>And Ross…</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, again congratulations. Oh yes, Chuck, go.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chuck Coppa</span></strong></p>
<p>I was just going to add one thing and as we look at our ability to take this waste stream and produce that usable CNG on the methane to be used in the dual fuel applications, we believe we can produce at a very cost effective and cost competitive price to what they would be potentially paying on the streets for the natural gas, up in the Bakken area and other areas. So we can definitely be very -- we can incentivize people to be able to start looking at the dual fuel because the natural gas they’d be consuming from this waste stream would be cheaper than what they would get in the streets. And now what kind -- as Lyle mentioned, more of an integrated solution, so historically we are out there selling the razor for the natural guys razor blade. Now in this case, we’re integrated. So, we’re producing a low cost razor blade for our razor dual fuel solution.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>And we think about it Ross, think about being able to potentially now have -- have the margin to rap tanks -- and tank and APG dual fuel costs into a contract where the price of the fuel is still more competitive than they can buy at a public pump price. And this whole integration of what could happen here is very interesting and very well-positioned.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, again, I am very impressed with your creative thinking, the vision, the execution. And having lost a lot of money in small company investing where the management just stuck with one thing to the bitter end, and I am really glad that you guys are thinking outside the box. I am very impressed.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And we’ll go next to Fred Milligan of Wunderlich Securities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Revenues you said coming in somewhere around $1 million or $1.5 million in terms of new units?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s what, that will be the -- yes, it depends on which size we go with and whether it has -- not all of them will have CNG day one because I got to be sure that we have a home for it. But let’s use that as a range of the new models going, coming forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>So, is there any royalty in connection to this or more of the expenses maybe to using this, your expenses?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>There will be -- there is a royalty, but it’s actually on -- because we’re public company, Trident was -- trusted our reporting numbers. So, there will be a royalty on profit, not a royalty on revenue, which is relatively small. And after that there is very little -- love it from the standpoint raw material is virtually right now for is a waste gas that we can pick up for very low cost. And then once -- because it’s a process controlled system and you’re able to -- it really does -- we’ll be able to telematically monitor multiple sites from a single site and basically have not as simple as, but almost a red, yellow, green where if it gets into yellow, you call the fuel tech and you’re telling that hey, it’s something here is almost out of tolerance. So, I really like it because it has low material cost, it has a very low royalty and it, from a labor standpoint, it does not have a lot of people cost associated with it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>So if the estimate is 1 million from the 1.5 million, how many wells are -- that really are producing something to get to that level?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s per site.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>The per site could have -- I don’t know, there is probably not going to be one, but let’s say at least per site I think will have on average of two to three. But we are talking to some that have four. But all of a sudden, you’re not at 1 million MMcf, not you’re double there. So, a site still -- regardless of whether you have two or three, the sites till takes and they have to pipe the gas. As they pull off the oil and it goes off to their storage units, they then have to -- that’s part of their requirement, not our cost is they have to then take pipeline and they have to bring the gas over to our site of the well site where our skid set and then we then take that gas and we’ll take it start it through the compressor refrigeration process and take it through.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chuck Coppa</span></strong></p>
<p>Just to be clear that when Lyle refers to 2, 3 and 4; he is referring to the drilling with wells that have [indiscernible] So, it will typically be deploying one system depending on the volume and the quality of the flare gas coming off. Typically one system per site but that we are talking with a couple of our customers, there are some very large sites that could potentially require multiple processing systems.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>On the cost, your cost, maybe standardize it with the sense that one well to the other just about the same cost?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>It will depend on the volume yet. So, as I said, we’ll probably have two different sizes, so there will be -- let’s call it, at a minimum, there will be two different standards. That has a lot to do with the size of the compressors and the number of compressors you put on it and/or the sizing of it. But there will be -- what we are working very hard to do is to standardize have kind of like the southwest -- bowing [ph] series is where -- let’s try to make both of them as standard as possible for spare parts, so far. And we’ve been watching these things run now since February and been very pleased to see the longevity of the parts and that there has not been a lot of maintenance cost to these. But saying that it’s important when we start thinking about 10, 15, 20-year program which these assets have, we do want to standardize as much as possibly can.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Would you see much of a difference in operating in the Marcellus as opposed to Bakken?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. The Bakken is truly unique from -- it’s got so much ethane and so much propane, part of the -- we think part of our solution, why it’s different than some of the people that have come to it. There has been a lot of people already come to the Bakken and have either failed or get a real black eye which is actually kind of hurt. So, it’s so similar to where we were five years ago in dual fuel where we had seven guys brag about their displacement rate only not to pass EP approval and in five of those seven are gone now and one of them like I said is down and out. Same type of thing has kind of happened where everybody ran to the Bakken with their Texas, Oklahoma technology or Marcellus technology that has nice sweet gas and it’s not worked in the high Btu gas. So, we -- again, Trident came up and said, boy, this is way different gas than we’re normally used to and there are certain things you have to do that are different there than you have to do other oil patches.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Are they distinct enough so that it prohibits operating in place but the Bakken?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>No, it’s just a matter of optimizing, being able to take a true high Btu waste gas and make it usable and in the Marcellus and Eagle Ford, we don’t have to put some of the process steps. Well, price still standardize and it will work, it’s just -- it won’t be attacking high gases, because of the high gas content won’t be there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>How are you going to sell this stuff in the equipment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re not selling equipment. Equipment will be owned by us and we’re selling the service. So, it’s pretty easy right now. We know exactly which customers have the 2,500 stranded and remote well sites; we know which ones we think have regulatory issues. And quite frankly, it’s amazing to me, we’ve only kind of introduced in the last 90 days and the opportunities are going to be. This in my personal life time this is -- one time before was involved in assembling personal computer cards for IBM when it first started and we took a company from scratch to over 100 million in a couple of years. And I can’t say that that’s going to happen here. All I can tell you is you just take 2,500 in the Bakken, you take another 2,500 outside the Bakken; you start in at the numbers; it’s a very large market that it’s different than the dual fuel market meeting the price spread because you have this regulatory problem that these guys have got to deal with.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>It sounds great. It sounds like you’re putting the moves back on.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lyle Jensen</span></strong></p>
<p>At least timing up the lug nuts, how’s that? Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fred Milligan</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>That concludes today’s question-and-answer session. At this time I will turn the call back to Lyle Jensen for any additional or closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Lyle Jensen</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Cassandra. Thank you everybody on a summer afternoon. But again, we truly are looking forward. We think we’ve done the due diligence that we need to do. Again, I thank the Board. The Board has been very actively involved in the due diligence and challenging of our thought process and how we integrate this business opportunity. And we look forward to here in the quarter to communicate and show you the results that we expect we can get. So thanks again. And we’ll talk you at the next phone call.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>This concludes today’s conference. We thank you for participation. You may now disconnect.</p>
