<p><strong>Marvin Ellison</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Trent and good afternoon, everyone. For the second quarter, we’ve met or exceeded expectations on a number of key metrics. Comparable store sales were up 4.1% in the quarter even with the shift of several key back-to-school tax-free events out of second into the third quarter.</p>
<p>Our 4.1% sales growth was on top of 6% growth in the second quarter of last year. Gross margin improved by 100 basis points to 37%, SG&amp;A was down $63 million representing a 310 basis point improvement from the same quarter last year. Operating income improved 120 basis points or 46% over last year and EBITDA improved 28% to $115 million.</p>
<p>Although there is much work to do and we have many areas of the business that require enhanced systems and process improvements is clearly that when we execute well, we can delivery profitable sales and take market share. For the second quarter, our top performing merchandise categories were men’s apparel, home, fine jewelry and Sephora.</p>
<p>First, we have said many times before that Sephora anchors our center core growth strategy comparable store sales through our Sephora inside J. C. Penney locations grew double digits in the second quarter. We have Sephora in over a half of our stores now and is also available on jcp.com. I’m very pleased with this new digital expansion of our partnership that we launched this past quarter. Sephora not only drives traffic in sales of J. C. Penney it serves as a point of differentiation that cannot easily be replicated in our industry.</p>
<p>Earlier this week our attendance at Sephora’s Annual Meeting where they shared their exciting vision for the future and I was able label continue my conversations with their CEO, Calvin McDonald and rest of their leadership team as well as their brand partners. We have a great partnership with Sephora and we will continue to allow and embrace the fact that they would be part of our long-term growth strategy. We’re also very excited that we’ll see a significant increase in the number of new locations next year and beyond.</p>
<p>Second J. C. Penney continues to be a destination for appointment shopping periods. As mentioned in our last quarter’s earnings call, we’re very pleased with our sales performance of Mother’s day selling period, sales in women’s dresses, giftful items like hand bags, accessories and fashion, jewelry were specifically strong. We’re also pleased with the sales performance to another key event of Memorial Day, Father’s Day and the 4<sup>th</sup> of July.</p>
<p>Now I’ll transition to omnichannel, although we’re admittedly behind the retail industry in our omnichannel strategy. I remain very satisfy with the progress we’re making. In the second quarter, sales growth through J. C. Penney.com accelerated sequentially from the first quarter and we’re very excited to see several aspects for our Omnichannel capabilities improving. For example, on one-third of our dot com customers took advantage of the ability to buy online and ship to store they desire, this results in more physical tips to our brick-and-mortar locations would add on purchases.</p>
<p>This continues to present sales growth opportunities and is an important part of our Omnichannel strategy. We’re also very pleased with the improvements in our ability to leverage our enterprise inventory to better fulfill customer’s online orders from store base inventory. We call this buy online ship-from-store. For retail with over 1,000 brick-and-mortar locations, leveraging enterprise inventory provides us with a great opportunity for stores to act as fulfillment centers. With stores located around the entire U.S., enterprise fulfillment increases the strategic significance of many of our brick-and-mortar locations.</p>
<p>Later this year, we will be [powering] (Ph) buy online, pick up in store same day on both of those in several key markets with a companywide rollout happening early 2016. Our goal is to continue to expand both of these capabilities to better satisfy the needs of our Omnichannel customers and never miss a sale.</p>
<p>I’m also thrilled that we just attracted two key executives at J. C. Penney as part of our Omnichannel efforts. Mike Amend formerly the Vice President of online, mobile and omnichannel for The Home Depot joined our team on August 4 as Executive Vice President of Omnichannel. Additionally Mike Robins formerly the Senior Vice President of Global Supply Chain for Target’s U.S. stores joined our team this week as Senior Vice President of Supply chain.</p>
<p>These two gentlemen are exceptional leaders in the industry, they have successful track records of creating enterprise inventory networks that enabled brick-and-mortar and e-commerce to merger into one seamless shopping experience and their backgrounds perfectly aligned with our long-term growth plans to become a world class Omnichannel retailer. We are excited to have both of them in our team.</p>
<p>Now turning to gross margin. We saw 100 basis point improvements in our gross margin in the second quarter. We are encouraged by this progress, but we know we can do more. We are executing against some plan to grow gross margin in a variety of ways. First, our private brands penetration and efficiency continues to be focus. We know that these brands provide excellent style, quality and value for customers as well as deliver gross margin above our national brands.</p>
<p>Next, we’re stepping up and starting to re benefits from the investments we made years ago in Oracle systems. These systems are designed to enable our teams to better merchandize into our stores and distribution centers and optimize our sizing, merchandizing planning, localization of our assortments and to make those into more efficient retailer. As we move to more selling seasons and build on a history. These tools will only become more useful and more powerful resulting in fewer markdowns as we end each season.</p>
<p>In addition, we need to continue to focus to enhancing the efficiency of our supply chain, which will be a key component of our ongoing gross margin improvement and this will be a priority of our new supply chain leader Mike Robins.</p>
<p>As a company we are also making renewed commitment to lower our overall operating cost, this commitment is evidenced in our SG&amp;A results. In the second quarter, we achieved $63 million of saving and improved our SG&amp;A guidance this year to reflect the savings we’ve already achieved. By improving process, eliminating bureaucracy, simplifying task and better leveraging our investment in systems, we are committing to permanently reducing cost and running a leaner, more effective organization without limiting our ability is to grow top line.</p>
<p>Now looking ahead to the third quarter remainder of the year, I would like to update you on our outlook for the second half of the year. We expect Q3 costs to sequentially improve over Q2. As you may recall last year in the third quarter, our inventory levels were very lean and candidly, we did not have enough product to support the entire back-to-school season and not enough seasonal inventory to support sales demand.</p>
<p>As a result, our top line softened but our gross margin expanded, we have done a much better job of planning our business this year and we are very confident that we would have a strong fall season. We’re also confident that we will achieve our full-year guidance of 4% to 5% comparable sales growth and all of the financial components of our annual guidance.</p>
<p>With that, I will hand the call over to Ed.</p>
<p><strong>Edward Record</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Marvin and good morning everyone. As Marvin said, we feel very good about our performance in the second quarter. Our teams continue to drive significant improvements across all key metrics and with our strong first half results; we are increasing our savings and EBITDA expectations for fiscal 2015.</p>
<p>The teams remain focused on continuing to enhance our commitment to deliver outstanding product, service and value for our customers as we progress towards our goal of $1.2 billion in EBITDA in 2017. With that, I will now take you through the company’s second quarter financial results.</p>
<p>Comparable store sales grew 4.1% for the quarter. While pleased with our results, we do note that the second quarter was impacted by the timing shift of tax-free holiday events in several key states including Florida. Most of these tax-free have now played in the first two weeks of August and we’re pleased with our strong start to the third quarter.</p>
<p>Our Brick-and-mortar business comp up low single digits this quarter and our dotcom results accelerated versus last quarter. As mentioned earlier, our strongest performing categories in the quarter were Men’s, Home, Sephora and Fine Jewelry. All regions of the country saw gains during the second quarter with Western and Central regions delivering the best comps.</p>
<p>We are encouraged by these results especially given we have yet to fully benefit from our growth initiatives in center core, home and Omnichannel. However, the early reads on our improved footwear presentation, which we completed rolling out in late July and our initial results from our center core pilot, which we are expected around next year, are exciting.</p>
<p>Our transaction count conversion and average unit retail for the quarter were all up versus last year. Looking to the second half, we expect improvement in our comparable store sales results versus the first half and we reaffirm our full-year guidance of 4% to 5% comparable store sales growth.</p>
<p>Now let me turn to gross margin, for the second quarter gross margin was 37% of sales representing a year-over-year improvement of 100 basis points, we saw significant progress in our clearance and promotional selling margins for the quarter, we continue to feel good about our plans to improve clearance margins to historical profitability levels moving forward.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, we expect continued gross margin growth driven by increased penetration in group margins in private brands better clearance profitability and as Marvin discussed greater efficiency of our supply chain and benefits of our new Oracle systems.</p>
<p>Gross margin for the spring season improved 220 basis points and we continue to expect gross margin for the full year to increase 100 to 150 basis points. However, as last year’s third quarter gross margins improved 710 basis points, we do not expect this year’s third quarter gross margins to increase at the same rate as in Q2. Our expectation is that our third quarter gross margin rate will be approximately in line with to slightly higher than last year’s results.</p>
<p>Now turning to expenses, the teams continue to do a great job of effectively managing expenses. SG&amp;A decreased $63 million and leveraged by 310 basis points, this was primarily driven by reductions in store controllable expense and advertising and increased revenue from our private label credit card.</p>
<p>Minimum wage rate increase is our leading topic in our industry and we continue to monitor the situation on a market-by-market basis to ensure that we remain competitive in our ability to attract top talent. Despite this and other pressures, we have improved our guidance as we now expect to save approximately $120 million this year.</p>
<p>Our focus on finding efficiencies and reducing expenses across all aspects of the business remains strong as ever. And we are committed to achieving the expense structure that makes sense for our business.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA was a positive $134 million and $95 million or $244% improvement from the same period last year. On a year-to-date basis, our adjusted EBITDA is $216 million this year versus a negative $45 million last year, a $261 million increase.</p>
<p>Looking forward, we want to remind everybody that we had a $92 million benefit from the sale of assets in last year’s third quarter. As we stated last quarter, we expect a total of $50 million in asset sale benefits this year of which we have already banked $38 million. This creates a tough comparison for Q3, but does not impact our ability to delivery on our full-year EBITDA expectations.</p>
<p>As a result of our continued expense discipline this quarter, and the improved SG&amp;A guidance for the full-year, we have increased our 2015 EBITDA guidance to approximately $620 million. We are extremely pleased with the progress we’ve made in our EBITDA and with the continued opportunities, we have to streamline our operations and drive additional gross margin range. We remain confident in our ability to delivery EBTIDA at $1.2 billion in 2017. Earnings per share for the second quarter improved 20% to a loss of $0.45. Our adjusted earnings per share improved 45% to a loss of $0.41.</p>
<p>Let me briefly touch on inventory and cash flow. Inventory is up 5.5% over last year. The two major reasons driving the increase are the back-to-school tax-free events that shifted into Q3 not only impacted sales, but also our inventory levels. And as we’ve previously stated we are building inventory levels this year as we ran extremely lean last year unless sales opportunities on the table, in particular in last year’s third quarter.</p>
<p>Having said that, we feel very good about our inventory content and the levels heading into the second half. Year-to-date our free cash flow is down $47 million versus last year. All of which is driven by our investments in inventory to fund our growth initiatives. We expect free cash flow for the second half of the year to be positive.</p>
<p>Now let me close with our outlook. Our full-year guidance is as follows. Comparable store sales are expected to grow 4% to 5%. Gross margin is expected to be 100 to 150 basis points above last year. SG&amp;A is now expected to decrease by approximately $120 million and a result of our improved SG&amp;A guidance, EBITDA is now expected to be approximately $620 million. Capital expenditures are expected to be $250 million to $300 million and free cash flow is expected to be breakeven.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll turn it back to Marvin to wrap up.</p>
<p><strong>Marvin Ellison</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you, Ed. And before opening for questions, I would like to take a few moments to share with you how we plan to simplify our focus yet intensify our commitment to delivering on our $1.2 billion EBITDA target.</p>
<p>Ed mentioned the importance of our growth initiatives in center core, home, and Omnichannel for the fall season. Although improving these areas are key to our growth, I felt it was also important to outline a more holistic strategic framework for the company. This framework will be made up of three simple strategic priorities and these priorities are private brands, Omnichannel and increased revenue per customer.</p>
<p>So let’s start with private brands. We will leverage our tremendous sourcing in private brands infrastructure to become the most efficient retailer at producing private brands with style, quality and value. Not only will this provide us with differentiation, it also allows us to grow our gross margins while limiting any potential show rooming that could take place from peer play online retail competition.</p>
<p>Second, we are committed to become a world class Omnichannel retailer. We understand the change in dynamics of retailer, we also understand that attempting to recreate a free 2011 J. C. Penny would not work in this new Omnichannel world, therefore are adjusting our business model and our leadership team to compete on this new Omnichannel retail landscape.</p>
<p>And third, we will adjust our merchandising and services to increase our revenue per customer. As we’ve shared before in 2011, we had approximately 87 million active customers and today we have approximately 87 million active customers. It is our responsibility to provide better choices for these customers to increase their shopping frequency and their transaction size. Our growth initiatives in center core and home will be elements of this strategic priority.</p>
<p>So to summarize, the three strategic priorities are private brand, Omnichannel and increased revenue per customer will become our strategic framework. This framework will allow us to simplify this in allocate capital and resources to areas of the business that will simply make us a better company.</p>
<p>We have also a lot of work to do o restore J. C. Penney to its status as a world-class retailer, but I’m very pleased with progress that we are making thus far and I possess a high level confidence in our ability to achieve $1.2 billion EBITDA target. We look forward to keeping you updated on the impact of these and other strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>As I close, I would like to pay a special thank you to retiring CEO and newly appointed Executive Chairman Mike Ullman. Over 12 years Mike served this wonderful company with humility, grace and compassion. Now I would like to personally thank him for all these done not only for the company for many men and women of J. C. Penney.</p>
<p>With that Laura, we will open the line for questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Matthew Boss JPMorgan. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Boss</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning and congrats on a nice quarter. I guess so Marvin as you walked store since joining, we have seen a number of visions unfold here over the past five years. I guess what’s different about yours, any transformational changes to expect in the brick-and-mortar stores and then across the stores where do you see the top opportunities for improvement if we think about from a category perspective?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>So Matt, I would say we have a couple of areas that I’m very proud of that we’re making progress on. First, I mean I think I have been in over 40 stores since I have been here and I have been very, very pleased with the overall statistics and the visual view of our stores, across the board, small markets, metro markets, low volume and high volume.</p>
<p>So I think the team has done a really nice job of consistency and what I call brand presentation. Where we need work is and what I call the science of retailing. Our size optimizations is not good, our replenishment in flow back is not efficient. We have significant improvements we have to make in the supply chain to lower the cost and increase the efficiency. We have to make sure our marketing is less broad and more one-to-one which is a cost effective and also creates a high return on ad spend.</p>
<p>So there are lot of elements that the naked eye can’t see, but it will allow us to be a lot more efficient. Ed mentioned that we’ve left sales on the table in the third quarter of last year, because we had a [indiscernible] position. I would argue we left sales on the table in the first quarter of this year and the second quarter of this year, because of our inventory position a lack of size optimization, some of the assortment of planning and allocation issues that we still have, because of the attempts recover from a failed strategy that Mike came into stabilize the company after.</p>
<p>Having said that every quarter, every month we get better and better and I can’t overstate the importance of merchandizing systems that we are going to reap the benefits from Oracle because it’s going to provide a lot more efficiency. Having said all of that, you’re going to see us or have a greater presence in center core. I mean we’re going to go and we’re going to set roughly 500 stores going into 2016.</p>
<p>We have pilot stores in 12 locations the pilots are exceptional and we’re excited about it. We have roughly 10 stores were rebranding our salon with in style and we put in capital to restore the esthetics of that environment. As salon customer shops was eight times a year, which is a significant component to the increased revenue per customer.</p>
<p>So those are the things that I see those on the things that we’re working on. We’ve some new initiatives that we’re going to try, we’re going to spend a ton of time making our omnichannel lot more effective, but believe these things will allow us to improve in second half and take that improvement into 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Boss</span></strong></p>
<p>Great and then just a follow-up. As we think about the gross margin opportunity, what’s the delta today between private label and national brand margins and then over what timeframe do you guys think you can restore those clearance margins back to historical levels?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I will take this one. So our private brand margins there is slightly above our national level. Clearly we’re looking to get that back up to the 300 to 400 basis points range above that, we think we can do that over the next two years and that’s part of the roadmap to our $1.2 billion EBITDA for 2017.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey look I just want to add that is not just a very statement that we made, there is a ton of work that we’re putting on our private brands, infrastructure, we’re spending a lot of time looking at pricing, we wanted a few large retailers out there that really leverage no analytics on pricing. We do it the old fashion way and so I have had the pleasure working with some brilliant third party experts on pricing, analytics and pricing efficiency.</p>
<p>And so we are partnering with some of them to come in to give us some perspective and to work on some projects, so we can have a more modern view of leveraging data analytics and a lot of components that we current don’t use pricing, we think that is going to play our role in increasing our gross margin performance in private brands.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Boss</span></strong></p>
<p>Great start, Marvin. Best of luck.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your questions. Your next question comes from Neely Tamminga from Piper Jaffray. Please go ahead. You’re live in the call.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neely Tamminga</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning and I just want to add my official congratulations to Marvin, the CEO on this call official. So we had a little bit of a question around other benefits on Omnichannel, we totally appreciate that things required sequencing and a lot of different moving parts there, how should we be thinking about when the benefit. Initiatives you are making on this key strategic priorities kind of cushioned out that much more of 2017 dynamic or is that something that is more of a 2018, could you just help us understand kind of when those benefits you think start to go through in the P&amp;L and I have one follow-up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely, as we’ve mentioned and we’re very transparent, we are behind the retail industry in lot of aspects, we are probably one of the few large retailers left that currently can’t execute [indiscernible] same than our stores. The good news is even though we are behind; we are sequentially improving every quarter as we did from Q1 to Q2.</p>
<p>Having said that we believe that we will start to see true benefits of Omnichannel strategy in the second half of 2016. We are seeing improvements with enterprise inventory today, I mean we are able to fulfill more .com orders that historically would have been simply out of stock because we can bounce the fulfillment from our DCs that services dotcom to roughly 250 stores and we can fulfill the orders from those locations that is a huge benefit, the other benefit is we’re capturing that data and so we’re updating the replenishment in the in stock performance in the DCs to reflect the fact that they were out of stock when an order came through.</p>
<p>We’re also going to be very aggressive in expanding our assortment online, I would argue that we have one of the most conservative assortments online of any large retailers and what I learn - previous is that if the customers pressure brand they will buy things online that you don’t sell in the store, if you look at J. C. Penney.com you will see a very strong representation of items we sell in the store and you see very few unique items that are online only. So my comment is coming in to lead this effort the first thing that he is going to do is work with the merchants to aggressively expand online assortment so that we can give our customers more of the things we’re looking for.</p>
<p>We have a lot of failed searches meeting customers to go jcp.com to key in an item they’re looking for and we have collected that data, so we know what they are looking for and we know what we don’t care, so we are starting our list with increasingly assortment on those items. So we think that we are going to see improvement but candidly we won’t see transformational benefit until the second half of next year and then we think that benefit will continue beyond that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neely Tamminga</span></strong></p>
<p>Marvin thank you that is helpful and just one quick follow-up for Ed, could you characterize the shift in terms of basic point for the sales - in a little bit different for everyone to pay [indiscernible] some of these states for you guys, have you quantified what you think the comp shift was? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, we have it is obviously very hard to pin that exactly but we think it’s by 50 basis point impact it shifted out of Q2 and Q3. I would also add though that we think that’s roughly the impact of Halloween following on a Saturday at the end of the quarter, so in third quarter we think it’s about a neutral and obviously it hurt second quarter by about 50 basis points.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neely Tamminga</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s great. Thanks, Ed. Sure.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you and your next question comes from David Glick from Buckingham Research. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Glick</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Marvin, just a question on how you think about the past two, the $1.2 billion EBITDA target that you guys obviously feel very confident about achieving, and clearly sound like you are on track to put up a 4% to 5% same store sales this year, but can you talk about how dynamic the path is to that called whether you necessarily need to rely on that level of sales beyond this year and what the key drivers are to get there perhaps on a lower comp stores sales pace. And then secondly as you approach that goal can you help us and think about how quickly you can deleverage the balance sheet and pay down that term loan. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>David, on the first part of the question, I mean we have a high real confidence that the $1.2 billion target is achievable because as you noted we have multiple path to get there I mean, as stars would sale but to your point sales in my view is not the key driver. the key drivers are gross margin performance and making sure we control SG&amp;A.</p>
<p>I don’t think any of us can sit here and tell you that we are satisfied with our SG&amp;A performance. We know that we have to aggressively look at cost and we started I think the second quarter performance should reflect that we are taking it very serious stands on making J. C. Penny a more efficient in low cost operator.</p>
<p>I come from a world where low cost retailer will always win and so we are taking a very hard look at everything that we are doing to ensure that we are focused on an SG&amp;A percent and SG&amp;A spend that is relevant for the business model that we currently operate, not that we operated pre-2011.</p>
<p>And so, as you toot out bureaucracy, as you start to ask very specific questions on how you leverage not only structure but how you leverage third party resources, you start to find very, very meaningful savings that you can identify we start to identify those savings and we believe we will continue to identify those savings.</p>
<p>So SG&amp;A and just being a more low cost operator than a key component, the second component is gross margin. We talked about the importance of private brands, and I think for us we have a great foundation and Mike Ullman deserve a lot of credit for the efforts that he placed on creating a private brand’s infrastructure and sourcing infrastructure here. I come from a retailer that was primarily national branded and we are very product of that. But when you are national branded retailer, you are facing enormous pricing challenges as you become an Omnichannel retailer.</p>
<p>And so we know what not only will our private brands give us differentiation they also give us the ability to have accretive gross margin performance while we are still very confident and very supportive of key national brand partners, like Nike, and Levi, and Alfred Dunner, and Dockers, and Carter's and IZOD. We are not going to lose those relationships, because customers love those brands, but we know private brands play a huge roll and I mentioned pricing, I mean we have huge opportunity in just the optimization of our pricing strategy.</p>
<p>We do it the old fashion way and we are going to modernize that, so top line is important and we have a line of sight, that are going to continue to grow top line, but we also will put intense focus on gross margin and intense focus on being a low cost retail and we believe those three things will need us to that target that’s why we are so confident.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Glick</span></strong></p>
<p>And in terms of the balance sheet?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure David, I’ll take that one.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Glick</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>We’ve done a lot of work around our balance sheet and will continue to do work in the future, right now we are sitting with about $4 billion in net debt or at least at year end we’ll have about $4 billion in net debt. We expect we’ll be able to through off at least $500 million of free cash flow over the next two year, which will obviously go to paying down debt and reducing that debt.</p>
<p>In addition to that, as you well know, we have the real estate term loan out there, the no call provision fell off in May, we continue to look at options there on how we can increase the tender potentially reduce the collateral and/or improve the terms on that. So we continue to work on that as well and we think there is some opportunities around that. So we continue to work on and we think as we moved on our path to $1.2 billion and we continue our deleveraging process.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Glick</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much. Good luck in the second half.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Kimberly Greenberger from Morgan Stanley. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kimberly Greenberger</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thank you. Really fine quarter. I had one question and one follow-up if I could Marvin the omnichannel initiative obviously sounds very intriguing. I’m wondering if you can sort to draw a path for us on what you’re expecting the progress on omnichannel to look like over the next one, two, three years. It sounds like a multiyear Endeavour and does the priority you are placing on omnichannel change the future path of CapEx in another words what sort of infrastructure would you like to see put in place to support that goal?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks Kimberly. Well for us we do believe omnichannel is a multiyear initiative so for us I mean we see it in a couple of ways first the benefits of will be tapping into enterprise inventory. One thing that we’re very confident is that our geographic location or stores is really a competitive advantage.</p>
<p>I remember years ago when many experts talk about how brick-and-mortar retailers would be at a significant disadvantage to peer play online retailers and I think now the sentiment has changed and brick-and-mortar locations are close to population density are being used for fulfillment, creates a more real time, more same-day advantage to get close to the customers. So we think enterprise inventory is a huge part of our success today and forward.</p>
<p>We also believe that when we are able to rollout, online, pickup-in-store both was same day that that’s really the key game changing initiative for a retailer. And again as I mentioned, we’re going to be powering it later this year with a rollout happening in the first part of next year.</p>
<p>We are very pleased with the progress, it can be understated the importance of brining in someone like Mike Ullman who has a e-commerce background. And Mike will be the first omnichannel leader that is truly a e-commerce expert who has real-time experience in managing e-commerce in different platforms, in different businesses. So he is going to bring a much more aggressive approach into the business and we think that’s going to allow us to grow and grow in a very efficient manner.</p>
<p>From a CapEx stand point we have a tremendous advantage, many retailers that are ramping up into an omnichannel world, they have to make significant capital investments in constructing dot.com distribution centers, because we are former catalogue retailer. We already have the supply chain infrastructure in place to leverage. So rather than spending significant capital and building distribution centers we’re spending less capital to digitize those distribution centers that’s the key bringing in Mike Robins from Target to work with us on the supply chain side.</p>
<p>He understands this transformation really well and he is going to help us taking the physical structures to digitize it, so that we’re actually a little bit of ahead of our competitors without spending the same amount of capital. No we’re going to have to spend capital, but we’re not spending capital on physical structure, there is more to the digitalization of those structure, which we think can be done and we are in the process doing it right now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kimberly Greenberger</span></strong></p>
<p>Excellent and then just the calcification I think you talked about wages it sounds like you’re monitoring and obviously complying with the mandate in the minimum wage increases. I’m wondering if you give any thoughts to the announcement by peer that they’re moving to a $10 a hour minimum wage structure in 2016 is that something J. C. Penny is contemplating or is your current wage structure sort of nicely above that level and you’re kind of already there. Thanks so much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Kim we are pleased to say that we don’t have one associate in the company that’s currently had minimum wage. We’ve already take actions throughout the year to raise every associate above the minimum wage so we believe we are in good position. As I had noted we’re paying very close attention market-by-market to the competitive landscape. Our field leaders have the autonomy to make the necessary decisions so that we can continue to try talent and we believe that we are not well positioned and we react without any bureaucracy to take care of the team’s ability to recruit and retaining talent.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kimberly Greenberger</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your question. Your next question comes from Paul Trussell from Deutsche Bank. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, very solid quarter. Just wanted to go back and touch on gross margins, you’ve had many quarters now of very strong performance and it’s clear that we remain confident about the opportunity to expand over the long-term. So just wanted to get maybe a little bit more understanding on 3Q with the expectation for those results to be more or less in line to only slightly above, just wondering why we are having a bit of a pause here just given its deal meaningfully below prior peak gross margin levels in the third quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes Paul this is Ed, I’ll take that. Last year if we look for full year, I think we improved gross margin 540 basis points, as I said in my scrip we improved in Q3 710 basis points, we really drove margin in Q3 and we think frankly we did it at the expense of top line in Q3 and as you know we’re up against soft top line comp in Q3.</p>
<p>Right now we expect to be able to drive the top line and our focus is in to drive incremental gross margin in that quarter, we still think for the full year, we are on track to hit the 100 to 150 basis points, we know we still have continued opportunities as we talked about earlier about private brand, we’re on track to be at least neutral gross margin in clearance but know there is opportunity beyond that and we continue to look at the penetration of private brands as well.</p>
<p>So there is lots of opportunities to drive gross margin, we ultimately think, we are going to continue to get it closer to our historical levels through the 150, 100 to 150 this year and then into next year and in the year beyond that but we don’t feel that Q3 is really the time to try and pick up 50 or 100 basis points margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>And Paul the only thing I will add to that is to put in perspective, I mean gross margin in Q3 of last year grew from the prior year 29.5 to 36.6 and this point that is pretty phenomenal growth in one quarter and we are not taking our foot off the pedal, I mean we’re going to continue to focus on growing gross margin the right way but we have a long-term view so that we can have sustainable gross margin growth or not heroics quarter-to-quarter.</p>
<p>And so we’re spending a lot of time on process improvement and we believe that all of our efforts allowing us to improve it as we’ve done this year and we have no intention to take our foot off the pedal, we just want to be real listing that last year Q3 was almost an anomaly but we’re going to stay very focused on it, we believe that we’re going to hit or beat our expectation for the second half of the year, for the full year regarding our gross margin targets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s helpful, thank you and then I just wanted to turn to back to the categories and maybe just get a little bit more color of the expected changes on a go forward basis particularly in Women’s which is the category you have the biggest merchandise mix-in, how should we think about additional merchandise changes this fall or heading into next year, how you’re thinking about positioning yourself for industry or to grow above industry pace and the same within Children’s and lastly maybe just touch on where we are in the overall home repositioning. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes I will take those Paul. I think for Women’s we’re very pleased. When you look at Men’s and Women’s apparel they’ve been two of our strongest businesses for the first half of the year in a marketplace and retail probably not as common place as you would think. So we’re very pleased, I think what you’re going to see more in the second half is going to be a continued focus on style, quality and value.</p>
<p>I mean we’re very pleased with our national brands; we’re very pleased with our private brands as it relates to those three things. I think you’re going to see a more emphasis on special sizes on [indiscernible] and Women sizes, our customers continue to ask for more assortment in a various and we are going to accommodate them because those customers are royal, in addition for that you’re going to see us spend a lot of time on as I mentioned earlier the science of retailing.</p>
<p>We are going to focus a lot of our intention and efforts on the allocation process, on the replenishment process and on the presentation. Those things may not find very strategic but for retailer the toughest thing to do is get the right product, right style, right quality, and to get the customer to be committed to it.</p>
<p>We believe we’ve done that, we have to now get the processes correct, so that when she comes and our size is there waiting for her. You mentioned, Kids and Home, in opinion were the two most devastated businesses in the fail strategy and we have made a lot of progress on to us early days or back-to-school I mean we are very pleased with the performance we are seeing in the Kids business and hope to see it continue month-after-month, quarter-over-quarter.</p>
<p>We had a lot of brands with discontinue, we had a lot of assortment changes we had to make, we had a lot of size and a lot of fit changes to get move back to the traditional business that we are known for and we are seeing those improvements kick-in and now we are focused on allocation inventory position et cetera.</p>
<p>We are pleased with our partnership with Disney, we are rolling out Disney baby, we are excited about that, we are the only legitimate Disney stall within the store, we are very excited about that and we have some other new initiatives will be rolling out later this quarter that we are very excited about as well. And on the Home side, again I don’t want sound too boring but our biggest issue in Home remains that we just have to get our inventory position correct.</p>
<p>We are still way too lean on some of the key categories like sheets, towels, and bedding, and we are working on that, we’ve made improvements and you got to you see more improvement throughout the year, we need to get our promotional cadence correct in that business. We need to be more aggressive on leveraging square footage to get greater revenue per square foot, and we are making those changes.</p>
<p>So we are pleased at Home was one of our best performing divisions in the second quarter. And we are committed to not, again letting up until we get this business fully turned around and storing online, and we are making progress.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Trussell</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good luck.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Matt McGinley from Evercore. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt McGinley</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. My first question is on the comp, specifically the guidance, now you’ve made a lot of progress in getting AURs in your transaction is up, so my question is on a go forward basis, how much do you think that comp will come from ticket versus traffic, and kind of thinking like as you cycled through all the clearance that was from the last few years may be that ticket may be harder to come by so is it more driven by traffic or do you still expect it to be in a kind of equally weighted benefit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Matt, it’s Ed, I’ll take that. Clearly we continue to see AURs moving up slightly but I agree with you, I don’t think that there is a lot of room to continue to raise prices in this environment. So frankly we continue to see it and as you call it traffic or conversion, we really see it on that side of the equation versus the AUR.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt McGinley</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. And second question is on the SG&amp;A decline of $53 million, how much of that was due to the closed stores versus internally driven actions of cutting costs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>The vast majority of it was from our cost cutting efforts I think that total impact to the closed stores was less than $10 million a quarter from an SG&amp;A standpoint. So the vast majority of that’s coming from our initiatives and really around back in the house and the stores because we don’t want in impact customer facing thesis and then as Marvin talked about getting more efficient in our advertising and even that corporate overhead played a significant role in the third quarter and of course the credit revenue was up as well. So all things are working from the SG&amp;A standpoint and it’s the initiatives we are driving not just to close stores.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt McGinley</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. And your next question comes from Charles Grom from Sterne Agee CRT. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Grom</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. Marvin, just when you take a step back in 2007, 2006 sales per square foot for the company was in the high 100s, today it’s closer to 120. And I’m just wondering your perspective on what you think the right productive level the boxes and could you remind this when you embedded in the $1.2 billion target, what productivity is suggested in that number?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>So let me, Charles, give me just a more high-level view and I’ll let Ed give you the specific numbers on productivity. Candidly what we are looking at as we kind of go back in time and we compare to business to previous performance is not necessarily trying to replicate some of the key metrics from the past, but we are more focused on just creating shareholder value.</p>
<p>And I’m not making that statement to avoid giving you specifics, but this is such a different retail today versus 2007, 2008 and my challenge to the team is that things that we did are during that time period to run an efficient role for retailer simply won’t work today, because we’re going to have a significant penetration of our business online versus in-store. So from a sales productivity it’s going to be difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison, because the emphasis on omnichannel is going to be so significant in the future versus what we had in the past.</p>
<p>We’re going to also take a hard look at every single thing that we sell and we’re going to start look at the business not only from the sales per square foot for growth dollars per square foot to ensure that we are very efficient, but at the end of the day the ultimate goal is can we create shareholder value with every decision we make to ensure that it is accretive to the overall business.</p>
<p>And so for [flora] (Ph) salon, center core all areas that create revenue in a way that we didn’t do it in the past and we didn’t do as attrition as we will in the future, but the key will be to change the dynamics of the business makes it very difficult to do an apples-to-apples comparison, but I will hand it over to Ed to give you more specifics on the numbers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. I just add I think you part of your question was part of $1.2 billion or what was the productivity embedded in that? As we talked about before, we have a lot of growth initiatives around center core, around home and around Omni that we feel really strongly about and we believe than our ability is to drive mid-single digit comps over the next few years. That said, we really only need to be able to drive low-single digit comps to still hit the $1.2 billion. So from standpoint of what productivity improvements baked into $1.2 billion, it’s a 2% to 3% comp store growth over the next few years and productivity will get us to $1.2 billion. That’s said, we expect to be able to drive them in the 4% to 5% to 6% when each over the next few years is our initiatives to kick in but we don’t need to hit the $1.2 billion.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Grom</span></strong></p>
<p>Because that appears to me that now it stabilize the ship here a little bit that may be the $1.2 billion is in a selling like all the people may be at the floor and there could be upside and the company did generate close to $2 billion EBIT a decade to go. I guess I was just kind of generous as to my question. Ed just on the P&amp;L here in the quarter just yet real estate and other expenses of about $19 million yet in your adjustments to the pro forma EPS you are deducting $6 million to get to the pro forma EPS of $0.41 I just want to because it just quickly explain the math therefore us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, as I think, our real estate and - bucket we put income from sale of assets other real estate deals litigation and gains or losses from our JV and then we determine how many of those do we think are truly one-time or not one-time. So clearly some of the gain on sales of assets we felt were one-time some of the other expenses that we incurred going in quarter we felt we’re part of the ongoing operations and do not back from an adjustment. We did end up with the $19 million chart we take for the full-year, we expect that bucket to be about a $30 million credit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Grom</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and then I may have missed but did you guy give that the traffic ticket mix in the quarter and then any thoughts specifically on August to month to day it sounds like things have pretty well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>On the traffic ticket average ticket value was up for the quarter. We’re not giving that traffic we’re using transaction as part seem transaction comes were also up for the quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Obviously its early days but we’re pleased with our performance and we’re very pleased with our start to back-to-school.</p>

<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Bernard Sosnick from Gilford Securities. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bernard Sosnick</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. I would like to say in complimentary sense that the tone of this meeting has much improved from our view point because you referred the need restore Penny to becoming a world class retailer, which is something that we hadn’t heard before and I’m very encouraged by that. I would like to go back over history if you don’t mind, in the 1990s Penney was striving to become a department store and wound up with breakeven profitability at about 2000 when Allen Questrom became CEO and he said it was a mistake to try to become a department store, what we saw on the following years was a tremendous turnaround and improvement in profitability. After his departure, there was the Penney is a department store and ever since then we had seen nothing but profit problems, how do you view Penney, is it a department store or is it something else?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s actually a great question and the best way to answer it is that we are - lot of customers to define J. C. Penney, we spend a lot of time since we brought on our new Chief Marketing Officer Mary Beth West asking customers what they think rather than the leaders of the company sitting around in a conference room deciding what we think the company should be. We think is more informative to reach out to the customers who have been very loyal to us, who are not spending as much as they used to and not shopping with the frequency that we would like but and we are asking them what would they prefer from a goods and services for us to carry.</p>
<p>The caveat with that is that we have one overriding objective and that is to create shareholder value and so as we created shareholder value, we are going to take this company and design it in a way that we’re going to serve the customers within the demographic that we are best suited in a way just more efficient than any other competitor in store and online.</p>
<p>I can’t minimize the importance of private brands as we strive to be a world class omnichannel retailer, again any retailer that is increasing their penetration on national brands while increasing their percent of online business will have to deal with some very capable, very capital intensive competitors of who are great at price analytics but as we continue to focus on making our sourcing and private brands more efficient, we believe we can become on omnichannel retailer and protect yourself of a profit and from a value standpoint unlike most retailers in our space.</p>
<p>So the short answer is we will allow the customer to define who you are and what we are and our goal is to respond to that well attempting to create shareholder value and making this world class company again.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bernard Sosnick</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much and wish you the best of success.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Your next question comes from Lorraine Hutchinson from Bank of America. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lorraine Hutchinson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, good morning. Marvin can you give us your thoughts on the health of the fleet, understanding center core did a nice remodel over the next couple of years, what about the rest of the store and how do you see the CapEx needs for the Brick-and-mortar stores were?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Well candidly we would love to have more capital spent. Having said that, if you look historically over the last five years, a significant amount of capital was put into the stores and as I said earlier, when the board and Ullman first approached me to consider coming to J. C. Penney, I candidly had not been in the J. C. Penney in quite a while and so I started to go around the country and just pop into the stores to get a sense of the culture and the sense of how the business was running and my first takeaway was the stores looked really good and I was surprised because of the Penney’s I remember was little tired and a little worn.</p>
<p>But I would have to admit that although some of the capital investments were not well thought out and they have not been accretive to the business, they have done a really nice job of cleaning the stores, brimming the stores and making them more modern. So we had an advantage that we put a lot of capital into the business over the course of last five years and so we are not so committed to going in and fixing stores that are broken out in all because we fix a lot of areas.</p>
<p>So the fleet in short, I think it is in really good condition, now we have capital allocated on monthly, quarterly, annual basis for maintenance and we are never going to slack on making sure that we invest in maintenance to keep our stores performing well, looking well and operational.</p>
<p>But having said that, we are also are going to invest capital in improving our IT systems. We are going to invest capital in digitizing our omnichannel platform and as we noted we are going to continue to expand Sephora in our stores, we’re going to have a commitment to center core and we are going to brighten and modernize the aesthetic outside of support to improve our cross selling and we’re going to be committed to making our salons more attractive and we have 12 locations we have invested capital in and we are monitoring the revenue.</p>
<p>So we will invest capital in the stores, we will be committed to expanding Disney shops in the stores and we will be committed to making additional changes but we are going to be very prudent, we are going to be very strategic and we are going to have to have a high internal rate return to any capital we put in but if we can get that then we will invested and we believe it will be very beneficial to the company.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lorraine Hutchinson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Ed, just a follow up, and you talked about $500 million of free cash flow generation over the next two years, what’s the CapEx run rate that you are building into that assumption?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>So this year’s guidance is between 215 to 300, will probably come in towards the high end of that range. I would expect next year to be 300, maybe slightly above 300 in the year beyond that 2017, we’re probably looking at 350 to 375.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lorraine Hutchinson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. And the next question comes from Michael Binetti from UBS. Please proceed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Binetti</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning, guys. So to your comments on the balance sheet could you I mean, obviously you referenced that the $4 billion in debt is some of that triggers that rolled off but could you help us think about maybe what you guys are looking at that will open up some optionality if there are some triggers on maybe perhaps on the cash flow of the EBIDAs that could open up on opportunity for you guys to make some changes to help improve the capital structure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you help me with the question; I mean obviously we expect to get to the $1.2 billion in EBITDA at $1.2 billion we think will be throwing off $3 million to $400 million or more of free cash flow each year and then obviously we expect that to be able to use that to pay down our debt.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Binetti</span></strong></p>
<p>I was more reference and you referenced that in May you roll the opportunity to look at some of the no call options thus opened up, may some of the things that wouldn’t make you hesitant to try and pursue some options to reduce some pretty high interest rate on some of the debt today or may be some things that can happen with the cash flows for the rest of this year that would accelerate that opportunity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Edward Record</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. So we have a real estate term loan on, out there today that I think give or take $2.2 billion, there was a 1% no call provision, that rolled off in May, it’s not due until 2018, so there is no gun to our head. But if there is something advantageous to company whether it’s from the terms of the loan obviously extending the tender of it or even to a degree we believe it’s over collateralized and pulling some of the collateral out. Those are also options that we’re talking to some of our banking partners with to see if there is an opportunity to take care of some of that if the market remained strong there may be an opportunity to carry that this year, if not we probably look at taking extending it next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Binetti</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And maybe Marvin, can you talk about the private label margin comment made earlier. As we walk through the stores, time-to-time, do we see things like friends, family sales signs hanging through the ceiling and we look at that and the promotion structure, that used to be you reserved for a small or less customers and not of with everyone, you guys drive a lot of traffic by putting private label items on sale. Is that one of things that’s holding back the private label margins from getting back to 3 to 400 basis point spread above the national brand, do you guys talk about and how should we think about the need to perhaps target a sales number lower if you try to pullback on that kind of the selling structure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Marvin Ellison</span></strong></p>
<p>Michael, we are very committed to being promotional I mean I think if we didn’t learn anything from the fail strategies that this is a promotional space that we are in and we are going to have to compete. Having said, that we think our current reward for room is not very good and so we are in the process of not only evaluating it, but following different things that we will do and we are very excited about a relaunch and redesign that we should rollout at some point in 2016. And we think that will address one of your questions of making sure that we are rewarding key customers for a lot, and not only rewarding them but we are able to capture very valuable data so we can have more efficient one-to-one marketing and communication with them.</p>
<p>In the mean time, we are going to take on some resources from very efficient third party companies to help us with our pricing analytics. As I mentioned, I do believe that one of the reasons why we are not growing our margin is fast as we like in private brands is that we don’t have a very efficient pricing strategy and it’s very old fashion.</p>
<p>So we’re going to spend a lot of time on that over the next couple months and we believe that we have a lot of margin that we can gain from having a different point of view, but we’re going to stay aggressive. We’re not going to do anything to put top line at risk and we believe as Ed has mentioned that we have plenty of opportunity within the supply chain, plenty of opportunity within our marketing strategy. Plenty of opportunity throughout our entire business and continue to find ways to grow for us gross margin while we continue to improve the processes that would be long term and sustainable</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Binetti</span></strong></p>
