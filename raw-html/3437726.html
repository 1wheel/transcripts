The Safe Harbor Statement will be read following the Q&amp;A. With us today are Guided Therapeutics CEO, Gene Cartwright; and the Company's Controller, Charles Rufai, CPA.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to turn the call over to Guided Therapeutics CEO, Gene Cartwright, who'll give an overview of the company's business activities and developments for the second quarter 2015. Gene will then turn the call over to Charles Rufai, Guided Therapeutics Controller who'll provide an overview of the company's key financial performance and operating metrics. He will then open the call for Q&amp;A. Gene go ahead.</p>
<p><strong>Gene Cartwright</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Robert. Hello everyone and thank you all for joining our call today to discuss Guided Therapeutics second quarter results. We admire to find our sales strategy and product positioning significantly over the last few months. So, I want to take just a moment to describe these changes and how we think they should benefit the company and the shareholders in the months and years to come.</p>
<p>As you may know, there are two uses for our product. The Triage is used for women who test positive for the Pap smear 4HPB in cervical cancer screening. Typically about 10% of women who are screened end up with a positive result. But over 80% of these positive Pap smear tests are false positives.</p>
<p>Without LuViva these women would go on to have a Colposcopy exam and a biopsy taken. By testing with LuViva prior to the Colposcopy we can prevent approximately 40% of the unnecessary biopsies from being taken and when LuViva says that a Pap smear positive women is negative, our level of confidence that we are right is 99%.</p>
<p>Acquiring new customers for this Triage is generally requires selling one clinic at a time, which is normal for a new technology. My experience is that it takes eight to 10 sales to change the physicians' behavior and then technically the doctor wants to evaluate the product especially when the number of customers that we have in the beginning is small. As the number of customers that we closed grows doctors are more inclined to follow another doctors' recommendation without dealing a lengthy evaluation study. At this point we are starting to see shorter evaluations in Canada now.</p>
<p>The second us for our product is for primary cervical cancer screening, similar to the Pap smear or HPV. As we stated before we see the primary market for this use in the developing world, there only a small percentage of women are tested either by the Pap smear or HPV. The Pap smear requires well trained Pap smear readers which are lacking in this country and HPV is a somewhat complicated molecular test and expenses for these countries implement. Each country is filling the following attribute of LuViva to be very compelling a nurse can run LuViva, no sample is taken, no laboratory is needed and a result is given at the point of care in only about a minute.</p>
<p>This is some of the main reasons why we're seeing a high level of interest in Turkey, Kenya, Bangladesh, Indonesia et cetera. I should also mention that the clinical needs for cervical cancer screening in these countries is very high since they do very little Pap smear of HPV testing. Additionally we're finding the government want to show that they're doing something for women's health both to improve women's health but also for political reasons to garner the women's vote and or support.</p>
<p>So right now and for the foreseeable future we are primarily focused on closing large sales normally by working with the governments in developing countries for primary cervical cancer screening. The clinical need is higher for these screening sales and there are also far larger than individual Triage sale. As many of you may know I have worked in the diagnostics industry for over 30 years and I want to point out that there are very few screening markets. Mammography, colonoscopy from prostate cancer and Pap smear/HPV, each of these markets is map since you were testing the entire population no just people with disease.</p>
<p>That is why our market opportunity for LuViva in the developing world is so enormous. We estimate that it is over $1.2 billion in our currently targeted market. And that assumes that only 50% of the age appropriate women gets screened once every three years. We announced the multi-year $10 million deal with Turkey recently which is the result of a large clinical study that they did using our product and primary cervical cancer screening. But even as a contract calls for 200,000 disposables for 2016 we think that may only be approximately 10% of the total potential market for Turkey.</p>
<p>We think that up to 3 million women per year could be screened in Turkey which would mean many more disposable orders. Although working with government in the developing world takes a long time to generate significant sale and it's hard to predict when they will be finalized they are serving well with the effort. Very few small companies have these sources of extremely large opportunities and we are confident we can continue to close more sales. We continue to believe that we will also generate substantial business in Kenya.</p>
<p>We hope to release more details about our work there soon but our near term results in Kenya is very well even bigger than Turkey. We are progressing with similar sales tactics in Bangladesh, Indonesia, Guatemala and Nigeria. Relatively there are screening opportunities in parts of Eastern Europe. There are also many other countries who's point of care technology could have very big advantages of screening and we are pursuing these as well. In order to get cash flow breakeven with our current expenses we don’t need to be successful in too many of these larger countries.</p>
<p>The Turkey deal alone gets us probably a little more than the third of the way there, if Kenya closes that may in and of itself get us to breakeven depending on if we get the contract and the size of the final deal we anticipate. If Kenya doesn’t get us all the way to breakeven than we believe the third deal will. That’s the way we're currently thinking about our business and our clear goal is getting the cash flow breakeven and then to profitability as soon as possible. With the just mentioned goals is our primary focus we will also continue our efforts with the Triages in both Europe and Canada. But we believe those sales will continue to grow just a bit more slowly.</p>
<p>We also plan to add more distributors to new countries. The two most popular countries in the world China and India are countries which we would like to start distribution in this year. We are working with a partner now in China but the distribution agreement has not been final. In India we are talking to a large international healthcare company regarding distribution there. We are also continuing our efforts here in U.S with the FDA. We were disappointed with our non-approvable letter which we received in May we were following the formal process of asking for follow up meaning to discuss the clinical protocol and the number of samples needed in the additional clinical studies which they have requested that we do. We will update you on our progress through transfer leases and other communications.</p>
<p>We are definitely intent on getting FDA approval but this process will take some time certainly more than one year from today. Fortunately for us the international market is much bigger than the U.S market and as I've already stated we are getting some real attraction in international screening market now.</p>
<p>From a financial standpoint I would like to highlight a few thing we reduced our burn rate in the first quarter and that reduction has been helpful for us to show a decrease in our quarterly loss form a year ago. We worked with our banker with Ladenburg Thalmann to clean up some outstanding issues regarding our capitalization as part of our last finance. We're happy to get the additional financing that we posed recently but unfortunately the rates had to be done right after our FDA news at a low stock price which made the rates more diluted that we would have liked.</p>
<p>We are working on ways to bring non-diluted capital into the company but our target-predict if needs will be successful. We are looking at out licensing a technology that we have that we are currently not utilizing now. We are looking at out licensing the selling of LuViva for couple of large markets. We've already out licensed one technology and we get quarterly well royalty payments on that deal. We are discussing a potential deal to accelerate the royalty payments and get a fully paid of length.</p>
<p>This quarter sales were below our target but we are encouraged by the Turkey deal and the other very large potential contracts that we're working. As for guidance for the remainder of the year, I want to give you two numbers, one is sale and the other is orders. As for orders today we have purchased orders for 57 units and more than 52,000 [instruments] disposables. Based on what we know today we could see additional orders ranging from an additional 37 to 67 LuViva and an additional 14,000 to 300,000 disposables before the end of the year. The reason for such a wide margin is timing into orders we're currently engaging.</p>
<p>At the sales we expect any year with revenue of about $1.1 million based on our current projections for build and inventory. Based on our cash situation our sales for this year will be limited by the amounts of parts we can afford by.</p>
<p>Now that we're gaining some traction in the market we have decided to spend more money on investor relations and public relations to try to increase the profile of our company and attract more investors who see our valuing proposition and potential. We signed a deal with IRTH Communications and we're working closely with them to get our storage all to a wider market. We hope that this in conjunction with other commercial news will increase our shareholder base.</p>
<p>The passport for our company is clear, we need to execute on the Turkey deal and sign one or two more large contracts which we are working to close as soon as possible. Factory takes us to cash flow breakeven. That’s a major goal that we are targeting. With that I'll turn it over to Charles.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Rufai</strong></p>
<p>Thank you again. Good morning everybody. We've put our sales revenue from the sales of LuViva devices and disposable for the three-months ended June 30, 2015 of approximately $103,000. Sales revenue from the sales of LuViva devices and disposable for the three-months ended June 30, 2014 was about $201,000. Contract revenue decreased to approximately $10,000 for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 from approximately 11,000 for the same period in 2014.</p>
<p>Related cost of goods sold were approximately $207,000 for the 2015 quarter of which approximately $73,000 related to variances which resulted in a growth loss for the devices and disposable of approximately $104,000. By comparison relative cost of goods sold were approximately $271,000 in the second quarter of 2014 which resulted in a gross loss on the devices and disposable of approximately 70,000.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses increased slightly to $1 million in the second quarter of 2015. That compared to $999,000 in the second quarter of 2014. Sales and marketing cost decreased to 183,000 in 2015 that was 345,000 in the same quarter of 2014. Active results for the second quarter 2015 the loss from operations was approximately $1.6 million as compared to about $2 million for the same period in 2014.</p>
<p>In addition, for the encumbered incentive for the 2015 period was $105,000 of expenses compared to $125,000 of expenses in 2014.</p>
<p>In the quarter just ended we had the dividend expenses on our preferred stocks of approximately $1.3 million. This contributed to a net loss for the three-months ended June 30, 2015 of about $3 million or $0.03 per diluted share. But a $2.2 million or $0.03 per diluted share for the same period in 2014.</p>
<p>We ended the quarter with cash of approximately $2 million compared to about $162,000 in December 31, 2014. We used approximately $1.2 million of cash in operation activities during the first six months of 2015. That compares to about $2.6 million for viable period of 2014.</p>
<p>Our non cash adjustment included a recovery of approximately $648,000 related to the changes in fair value of warrants expenses of about $529,000 also related to non-cash stock based compensation. I would like to turn the call back over to Gene for closing remarks. </p>
<p><strong>Gene Cartwright</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Charles. We are confident that our business is now starting to grow significantly and this growth should accelerate. Our strategy of selling to governments in the developing world for primary cervical cancer screening is proving to be successful. Our contract with Turkey is the first real proof of that. The market in the developing world is big and the clinical need is significant. We look forward to updating you on our progress going forward. Thank you.</p>
<p>Alright, we will turn it back now to operator.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question comes from Richard Keim from Kensington. Management please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Keim</span></strong></p>
<p>You have stated that you're spending a lot of -- spend a lot of money on public relations, stockholder relations [indiscernible], how much are you spending?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Quite a lot more than we used to and we barely have been spending anything up till now and I would say that I don't think I really want to divulge a number but it is [indiscernible] for us, but still manageable within our budget.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Keim</span></strong></p>
<p>I don't understand how it can be manageable within the budget that you have a negative cash flow, you have no value in your stock, the stock is up -- you see today your stock is up by only 6%, because it -- because it went up $0.005. I don't understand why you're spending any money on that. Why are you spending money on parts and stuff like that and -- if you could fill more orders, what you want to do is get this thing to other cash flow, you are not doing that. You're spending money on public relations, on stock relations, that have nothing to do with the value of the stock, the value of the stock is done by you guys are doing a good job, getting on a positive cash flow and you're not doing that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Richard, I do appreciate your comment, I clearly understand it and I will tell you that we are looking for additional cash to buy more parts to be able to fill more orders this year, first quarter of next year because we know that our first quarter and ongoing is pretty steep, so I take up your advice and we think it's a combination of both things, both the commercial success and shipments and so forth but also we have to get, we have to get the word about our company out a little bit more, but I appreciate your advice.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Mark Steadman from Trimark. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Steadman</span></strong></p>
<p>I hope I think you repeat I missed the earlier part of the call, could you discuss a little in terms of how long the pilot study in Indonesia will be?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Don't really know, we've been over there once couple of months ago, we actually had a very high level meeting with our distributor and the government, that personally -- it with the Ministry of Health, we're planning to over I believe it's next month. So, we should be able to provide more information after that trip next month.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Steadman</span></strong></p>
<p>The studies that are previous would be done in Turkey and Kenya how long did they take from start to finish?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>The Turkey study probably took about a year, it's hard, we don't have exact information, we did go over and meet with the doctor who've performed the study and discussed the results with him last October I think. So, it may've been little shorter than that, but probably wasn't lot shorter than nine months, it was -- it takes a while.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Steadman</span></strong></p>
<p>Also, just a couple of financial questions, what is your approximate burn rate right now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>About 400,000 a month.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Steadman</span></strong></p>
<p>And did I understand correctly that Charles said that there was 2 million cash remaining at the end of June?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>That's right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Steadman</span></strong></p>
<p>And is that after paying Ladenburg, its fees and paying off various loans?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>That's also correct.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Lizzaro [Portal], a private investor. Please go ahead. Lizzaro you have the floor, please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p>Moving on to our next question which comes from Robert Johnson from Guided Therapeutics. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, I'm not from Guided, that was a mistake, she has been with call, I was calling in about, I'm an independent retail investor. I am curious I believed in the past, you're able to collect 50% of the orders in advance in order to finance the manufacturing of the LuViva devices and buy the cervical guides. I did a little arithmetic on the Turkey order and it appears that you sold products that are low priced in exchange for that low price can you work out a deal with Turkey and other countries that are buying large orders over period of years where they pay you in advance part of the money in advance or monthly payments in advance or even 30 days in over years. So that you can finance the manufacturing with sales revenue as oppose even non-dilutive financing. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s good question. I think the hard part for us is just here over the next couple of months once we get the selling process going. I think you're that the sales will fund a lot of purchase of the parts it's just getting restarted. We do as you said get 50% we get a 50% basically on a shipment and then 50% at 30 days is what our terms are. So the problem is that takes us a few months obviously to build the equipment and so to get ready for shipments and that’s really the issue we're dealing with now. We are in discussions with other parties to provide additional cash for us to be able to build these instruments. So we're certainly not finished and we may be able to do more than we said but that’s the current status.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Well I think Turkey should pay you chunk in advance to get it going like 0.5 million in advance. So that you don’t have to get any financing, I mean Turkey got a great deal on these LuViva's and on the cervical guides. So I think you should try to negotiate that.</p>
<p>I have another question sorry but this is about the FDA. On the last conference call you said that you were going to schedule a meeting with the FDA and I believe that meeting was intended to argue about the two patients where you disagreed on data interpretation and that was the difference between 98% and 99%. I realized that they also want more patients' trailed more patient data number of patients and I don’t expect anything expect possibly conditional approval where they would approve it now based on doing further post marketing studies. My basic question is there even a prayer that the FDA will come around in next month or two.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s very well thought out question Robert. And certainly we couldn’t agree with more. But I would say there is not much chance of it, we are going to be talking to them both asset design of the additional study as I mentioned. But also you mentioned about the disagreement that we had both in the classification of samples and also how to analyze the data in which one particular type of analysis. So we're going to be discussing both but I think that for them to say that we can do the study that has been proposed as oppose to pivotal study I don’t think there is very high chance of that. And certainly we've already told them that we'd be happy to do that. But they did not agree with that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I understand if you don’t mind a couple of more I think are good questions. This would be very quick. How many nations have completed their evaluations? How many have rejected LuViva for data or told you they will not buy LuViva and which nations are still evaluating LuViva.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>So that’s good question, I mean I'd say right now that Turkey is probably the only and Canada with number of customers. But in terms of the screening model Turkey is really only one that's completed they're probably four or five that are underway right now Nigeria has also told us that they don’t need to do any more data. The issue with Nigeria is that the country is gone through a change of government and so we're working with people there now but they told us previously that they were basically done generating data.</p>
<p>In terms of countries that have rejected us it's really only two, the U.S obviously and so far and the UK. The UK basically just told us that we need to generate more data in UK. So just not that higher priority for us now we'll get to is but generating more data doesn’t come to free and so we are watching our cash carefully.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Right while I'm more interested in the primary screening opportunities not any Triage in Western Europe that’s not your bread and butter you need cash quickly. I was a little disappointed in the number of cervical guides sold in the second quarter. Can you give us some details about that based on the number of LuViva's and your installed base that was very few tests done per LuViva unless they bought them in bulk and advance and just have meted re-order.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that's far, what your last point is probably most of it, but Robert frankly we agreed it was -- the quarter was not good but we also know very confidently that it's all going change right here -- it's changing as we speak, we'll work on them. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm confident as well thank you for saying that. What -- can you give us a solid number on your installed base of devices required to produce sufficient cash flow to breakeven on a maintenance basis excluding growth CapEx and working capital and when do you think that might occur. And there is how many do you need to have in use to pay your bills of cervical guide sells.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Well it's going be a really pretty wide range. I'll tell you why, but you will be able get a sense for it. But just as a note in the Triage market they may order 500 to 1000 cervical guides per year probably maximum. However in the screening market and we talked to one customer about this -- the maximum that they could order per instrument per year is about 10,000, that’s about 40 patients per day given the eight hour shift or 250 days. So that’s why the range is very wide. Based on our selling price in the screening market it's over 500,000 cervical guides we have to be selling per year in order to hit cash flow breakeven. So it's somewhere between 500,000 and million probably in that range and so that’s probably all the best information we can provide.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So it's been a long time since these evaluation has began so most of these nations that have ongoing evaluation should be nearing completion. Correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I mean -- as I said in my remarks we definitely expect to have more savior Turkey this year and maybe very very soon. And frankly at that time this going be a little hard for us to keep up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And couple of years ago before you started with the company Dr. Faupel told us that with about a 120 LuViva devices per year, you could achieve 20% gross margin on the LuViva is that anywhere near still accurate?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it's going be more and talking about insurance specifically and that reduction of cost as our volume goes up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Right labor cost per device and maybe a lower parts prices paid by you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it's probably about double that number. It's probably about 250 but we're working on it and obviously every cost reduction we can get is critically important for us some of these parts however custom and so it's hard to get competing there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So 250 and you can make 20% [GM] you think?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>I would say that’s not unreasonable.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And how many that just a breakeven?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>On the instruments and this is cervical guide business so...</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, I know but it would be nice not to lose money on any LuViva you sell to?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s true, that’s true; I can't -- I don’t have a numbers to really answer you confidently on your second question.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Chad a Private Investor. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I also have a few questions to just start maybe too many in the queue; going back to one of Robert's questions about initial payments. I'm curious what you think a likelihood is to be able to get some sort of upfront payments on the additional country orders. It sounds like that was not able. Do you want -- do that or it's Turkey I don’t know, if you attempted to that but is that being attempted with additional orders and what's maybe the likelihood of that and my biggest concern is cash flow like most investors. So I just wanted to dive a little detail on that and what the compensation to the distributors is that you could clarify that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Two questions -- so yes we are still talking to our Turkish distributor and as well as others about financing more of this initial parts buy and so it's not -- it's certainly over yet. As you may know there our Turkish distributors invested in the company last year fall, just in equity investment with the company. So they are very good friend of the company and are very strong partner of ours so we're just in those discussions now, so that’s answers your first question.</p>
<p>And secondly what I think -- I think what you getting at is how much money are the distributors making, what sort of markets are they giving. And typically we generally don't know that. We know that for the swinging market the volume is big and the price point is -- it is pretty low and so they are going to be making their money on volumes probably, probably not so much on price, because that nature of the market in developing world is not a high priced market but we can both make money, both the distributor and we can make money. I should may be add one other thing, I may have mentioned this in past calls, but we are working on a new way to make our cervical guides that will reduce their costs pretty significantly and it's very simple to explain. Each cervical guide currently comes with a cap that is used for calibration before use.</p>
<p>However it's possible we believe to instead of shipping one cap which is the large part of the expense for the cervical guide. Instead of shipping one cap for each tube, we ship one cap may be for each 100 tubes, so we're working on that now and we feel pretty confident that we'll be able to deliver that this year and so that would be helpful to us. It's also helpful to the distributors because they pay the freight for shipping and the caps will be much smaller -- the number of caps and they could be shipped by air and the tubes actually can be shipped by a boat, which is much cheaper.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, so as my understanding is that the unit, the machines were and have been sold essentially at cost, was that still the case with the Turkey order?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, there's nothing, nothing essential there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So, there -- and what is the margin on the disposables for that order? What is that approximately?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we've said generally that as the margin is over 80% in the swinging market, so little less than that, but it's more than 50%, more than 60%, I would say, but it's less than 80%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And you've touched on it already, but the ability to fulfill orders that you get to more, one or two more orders from additional countries and you don't achieve any sort of upfront payments, can you say a little bit more on what's -- what the ability would be to fulfill orders on that, what would be the timeframe for, if you got another order like Turkey, then would you be able to execute on it, if there was no upfront payment, would there be enough cash right now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Probably, not right now. That's how we said what our sales will be for this year, we probably -- without additional cash we can't achieve any higher sales, if we got additional cash today and we got another order in today, if we really -- it would be right at the end of the year that we'd be able to build new orders at a significant rate, it takes us a few months to -- takes us a couple of months to get the parts in and then obviously a couple of months to develop the units and so forth, so, that's really what we're looking at and that's the issue that we're trying to solve. Now, at first we get these couple of orders but -- no, I think that's really pretty likely and so we know we're going to be dealing with this, we'll probably have to add a few people to increase our manufacturing for the instruments, the cervical guide themselves or as you may know are made by third parties for us and so ramping that up is pretty easy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Last question, can you comment on what those additional technologies are that use license and are looking to license? I haven't heard about that from past.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Two things, there is a little company called Freedom Meditech and they relicensed the technology to them that enables you to assess someone's propensity for diabetes by looking -- by doing spectroscopy of their eye. And so, they currently pay us a royalty and so that's one technology.</p>
<p>And then the other is the technology for -- it's called Interstitial Fluid Measurement, ISF measurement and so that's also used in Glucose monitoring and potentially in trans-dermal drug delivery, so we are talking to SD about that, but we haven't -- we obviously because we don't have cash to be working on those, had there is been some work done on the ISF technology here, primarily through grants that we've gotten through the government. But we're not actively working on it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Our next question comes from Lizzaro [Porta] a private investor. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm a new investor couple of weeks and I'm curious in finding out on your upcoming September 15th special shareholders meeting, is there an agenda in place that would be sent out prior to that meeting beside the proxy votes?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>The proxy really is the agenda we're only relating trying to accomplish one thing of that meaning as to get more shares. That’s really is a very simple request that we're making sure. We don’t really plan on making presentation or that sort of thing at that mean.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And also just for informational purposes. Do you plan on doing shareholders meeting where we are able to maybe fly over to your offices for a presentation again being a private investor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>You're certainly -- I am happy to talk you, we're happy to have to host you here if you're interested. Just contact if our Web site or we can work that out but we have had investors who have flown and once it was happening and we're always happy to host them.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We have a follow up question from Robert Johnson. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry I am full of questions today. I noticed that you spent almost 1.3 million on deem dividends on preferred stocks much, much higher than in the past. Is that a one-time a year thing it's that a non-recurring thing? Everyone knows it's clearing obvious for your cost of capital is being crushing the company and the stock, no one is happy I'm sure you're the least happy of everyone. What's going on with these deem dividends on preferred stock and your interest expense and also when you initially said at the beginning of the call? You were working on out licensing I thought you might you're going to out license the LuViva like perhaps the China or you can just collect the royalty check on that and let them deal with manufacturing distribution and all that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes you've asked a few questions Robert thank you. And to your last point that is what I mean that we are as one of the three or four things that we're looking non-diluted financing. We are looking at out licensing LuViva in a couple of markets more or less as you described. So again we're not sure that’s going to work out but that would bring non-dilutive money into the company. I'll let Charles answer your question about the deem dividend.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Rufai</span></strong></p>
<p>Do way the deemed dividend works is when you'll have one option of any derivatives that is classified as debt. You have to do it one valuation on every quarter to figure out what is the potential loss this is not a natural loss it is deemed event if it happens. So every quarter we will do an analysis of the ones that have considered debt not the ones that are considered equity and we would have put a number it's not a natural number it's just a deemed event.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Is it a non-cash expense?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Rufai</span></strong></p>
<p>Definitely non-cash.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from Mark Steadman from Trimark. Please go ahead with your question. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Steadman</span></strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to do a follow up on the ncap you are discussing earlier. Could you give us a time frame in terms of how much longer you think testing the development would be and then how much longer would be before you think it might actually given to production?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>We are planning to do it this year so it will in fourth quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Steadman</span></strong></p>
<p>So it means we'll actually start to ship in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gene Cartwright</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s our plan.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>This will conclude our question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the conference back over to Robert Haag for any closing remarks. Please go ahead.</p>
