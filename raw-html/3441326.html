These forward looking statements could opinion assumptions, estimates, and management’s assessment of future plans and operations. </p>
<p>The words anticipate, expect, forecast, and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward-looking statements. Although Intermap believes these statements are based on information and assumptions which are current, reasonable, and complete, these statements are necessarily subject to a variety of known and unknown risks and uncertainties. You can find a discussion of such risks and uncertainties in our annual information form of the securities filings and more specifically in the company’s press release dated June 22, 2015 regarding the Letter of Award for Orion Platform implementation. </p>
<p>While the company makes these forward-looking statements in good faith, should one or more of these risks and uncertainties materialize or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary significantly from those expected. Accordingly no assurances can be given that any of the events anticipated by the forward-looking statements would transpire or occur or if any of them do so with benefits that the company will derive there from. Also forward looking statements attributed to Intermap or persons acting on its behalf or expressed to qualify in their entirety by these cautionary statements. The company does not undertake any obligation to update publicly or to revise any of the forward-looking statements made in this conference call whether as a result of new information, future events, or otherwise except as maybe required by applicable securities law.</p>
<p>With that I’ll hand over the call to Todd Oseth, CEO.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Oseth</strong></p>
<p>Well, thank you Cory. Good morning and welcome to Intermap’s Q2 2015 earnings call. During the quarter we generated $700,000 of revenue which was slightly less in the first quarter and our adjusted EBITDA loss was $3.7 million essentially flat with the first quarter. However, these financial results only begin to tell the story of what’s happened to Intermap in the second quarter. </p>
<p>We won several cornerstone InsitePro software deals. InsitePro was our risk related platform. We received a Letter of Award for $125 million for just the development component of the SDI. We won a $2.1 million data acquisition project with a repeat customer and we continue to transform Intermap into a leading provider of geospatial solutions. All in all some very big wins for the organization. </p>
<p>We have been talking for years about how our geospatial 3DBI based applications will make a difference for our customers. And how our SDI Orion software gives large organizations and governments the ability to customize, organize, and analyze geospatially. This quarter delivered all of the front’s turnaround. </p>
<p>First our risk based application called InsitePro had more significant wins this quarter than ever before by providing a worldwide flood model. Using our 30 year data we opened and entered new markets that Intermap has never sold into before. In Q2, Intermap announced an agreement with a leading global reassurance carrier to license InsitePro in Argentina, Peru, Columbia, and Chile. </p>
<p>The adoption of foreign insurance throughout South America is increasing and InsitePro is right in the middle of this emerging market. InsitePro will be delivered to underwriters in this Latin American countries so that they have the necessary software to evaluate specific locations one by one or thousands at a time using innovative and reliable risk models and analytics designed by Intermap. </p>
<p>InsitePro is a tool that analyzes the risk of different perils associated with a specific address. For instance when underwriting flood insurance each of the risk needs to be calculated against an acceptable flood model and then analyze this potential risk of being impacted by a flood or other peril. These models are developed using an elevation model and then combined with other geospatial data such as land classifications and water produced by a storm as well as previous claims data that the insurance company may have used. </p>
<p>Intermap builds its flood models using both its World 10 DEM data and in some cases ultra high precision Intermap 5 meter [ph] data and LIDAR data. Now all of these models are available through InsitePro. This allows the larger underwriters to expand our market share in emerging areas. Some of the underwriters use this tool for marketing purposes and some use it for specific underwriting, depending on where they are in the penetration curve for that specific market. The InsitePro is ideally suited for this use and is slowly gaining functionality that can really improve upon the outlook provided by the RiskMeter product with CoreLogic which is its main competitor in the marketplace. </p>
<p>InsitePro wins show more of how our strategy takes spatial data infrastructure and creates vertical applications. Our SDI capability that allows us to work with local enterprises and governments is core to our strategy for creating sustainable and profitable products in the future. We have identified over 2600 companies in just the U.S. that can use the results of our InsitePro Software. </p>
<p>Our next big news was the first win of an Orion SDI. The negotiation of the definitive terms of the award are in process and as stated in the press release, a minimum revenue of $125 million is scheduled to be recognize over just the first two years of the contract. And that's all our portion of the award. The fund, that’s us just Intermap wins the first $125 million. The final terms and scope of the projects are currently being negotiated and we have had personnel in country, there about four of the past seven weeks. </p>
<p>In addition to the development part of this program we have been asked to provide operation and maintenance of the system for the next 18 years after it has been developed. This is clearly a big win for Intermap. We will also be looking to develop custom and vertical applications to sustain our position with this SDI customer. </p>
<p>Products like InsitePro will help the local government organize, analyze the geospatial data. This customized development will provide Intermap with additional up sell revenue opportunities in the future. All in all it was a great quarter for Intermap to demonstrate these two key cornerstones of our Orion strategy. We are working diligently on more InsitePro wins and other Orion SDI contracts that we are optimistic we will close in the not so distant future. </p>
<p>Now I would like to turn it over to Rich for a discussion on our financials for the quarter. Rich. </p>
<p><strong>Richard Mohr</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Todd and thank you all for joining us this morning. As our press release noted and as Todd mentioned, total revenue for the second quarter was $719,000. This was slightly less than Q1 revenue $956,000. </p>
<p>In the first quarter we had recognized $332,000 of mapping services revenue and in Q2 we only had $69,000 of mapping services revenue, which makes up the majority of the difference between the first and second quarter revenue numbers for this year. These numbers will change materially to the better during this coming quarter as we recognize revenue from the $2.1 million contract we announced early in June and possibly the start of revenue from an SDI. </p>
<p>The bottom line for the quarter was an operating loss of $5.1 million and an adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.7 million. Our Q2 adjusted EBITDA loss of $3.7 million was almost identical to that of the first quarter which came in at $3.6 million. </p>
<p>To compare this current quarter with the second quarter of last year, in the second quarter of last year we reported a single contract for a $1 million for a data sale to the U.S. government and our data sales in Southeast Asia were also stronger than this current year. We had no similar sized contracts with U.S. government in place for the first half of this year which has had an impact on our total revenue year-to-date. </p>
<p>A large portion of the $2.1 million contract that we announced on June 5th will be recognized as revenue during the third quarter. Our filing on that project was completed during the first week of August, ahead of schedule and under budget. It is truly a spectacular data set to see and we thank all of our employees for making this happen. </p>
<p>We are now in the data processing stage of that contract with final deliveries expected by the end of the year. We recognized revenue on this contract on a percentage of completion basis with the majority of the revenue coming in from our flying operations. Even though our overall revenue is down this year compared to last year, our operating costs are also down. If we exclude an increased level of non-cash compensation from our operating cost, our operating cost compared to last year showed a decrease of 14% for the second quarter and a decrease of 17% for the six months period. As a result our operating loss on a year-over-year basis for the six months period remained essentially unchanged despite the lower revenue levels recognized this year. </p>
<p>The obvious takeaways so far this year is that there has been a lag in our revenue due to the lifecycles of our Orion Platform based SDI contracts and other projects based work we typically have under contract. We believe, the Orion SDI contracts we are hoping to close this year will truly bring about a transformation of the company. Efforts on the $125 million SDI Letter of Award that we announced at the end of June are continuing at full pace as we progressed towards a definitive agreement in the final scope of the project. </p>
<p>We have had representation in country for four of the past seven weeks and we are optimistic that the definitive agreement can be in place by the end of the quarter. Also I have received questions from some of our shareholders about how much of the announced $125 million Letter of Award is our portion. The answer to that question is 100%. We also recently received 100% of the 18 year recurring maintenance revenue of an additional $50 million to maintain and manage the program. </p>
<p>One last thing to remember as we talk about these SDIs is that the customized software applications that will be developed under these countrywide programs should feed our capabilities in the future are not only other government SDI projects but also enterprise based geospatial applications all over the world. In addition to the $125 million Letter of Award that we’ve announced on June 22nd, there are other Orion SDI opportunities that we are working on as well. </p>
<p>Although we never know for sure what these opportunities will ultimately close and the timing there of, all signs at this time continue to point in a positive direction for at least one more of these SDIs to close during the current year. We’ll obviously keep you updated if anything changes. </p>
<p>So now let’s turn to a review of cash in the balance sheet. Cash at the end of the quarter was $600,000. We closed the follow on financing two weeks after the quarter ended for $3 million on July 13th to bolster our balance sheet. We used $3 million of cash in operations during the quarter and we have $3.5 million in net cash provided by financing activities. </p>
<p>Outside of our cash balance at the end of the quarter, the combined balance of the accounts receivable and unbilled revenue totaled just under $1 million. Our accounts payable and accrued liabilities increased by $800,000 at the end of the second quarter when compared with the first quarter and most of that increase was from accrued interest on our outstanding notes payable. The expected timing of the definitive agreements in funding of their aforementioned Orion SDI contracts will dictate our need for any future capital. </p>
<p>So to wrap up we remain very optimistic about our opportunities in the coming months and the financial performance that we can deliver. We are all very anxious to get going on these SDI contracts and deliver world class products and services to our customers. There is a buzz in the hall with Intermap that’s pretty apparent. We believe that we can make a major difference in these countries and certainly other countries that may fall out. </p>
<p>I am looking forward to the opportunity to report back to you about ramping revenue levels and healthy adjusted EBITDA NUMBERS once we’ve launched on an SDI contract. As always we welcome discussions with our investors to help answer any questions you may have so please don’t hesitate to contact either Cory or myself if you need further clarification on any piece of our business. So that covers the financial update for the quarter and now I’ll turn the call back over to Mr. Oseth for further comments. Todd?</p>
<p><strong>Todd Oseth</strong></p>
<p>Thanks so much Rich, and while the revenues for the quarter were low I am pleased with executing the wining of both a very large SDI and a numerous InsitePro opportunities. It has taken more time than we planned for these SDIs, however, our financial performance should start to show the results either late in the third quarter or early in the fourth quarter. These larger SDI implementations are going to be difficult to financially analyze because they are a blend of different types of products and services each tearing different operating margins, on a combined basis though the operating margins should be very attractive. </p>
<p>Our IFSAR acquisition business continues to deliver the most accurate DEM for the money all over the world and this business delivers above average returns. This is combined with LIDAR acquisition and satellite acquisition where we team with partners around the world and this work delivers typical subcontractor types of returns. </p>
<p>Lastly our Orion Software and our other vertical applications like InsitePro delivered standard software returns and are both highly dependent on the number of users and complexity of the analysis required. We put all this together. We believe we have created a business model that has above average returns and is based on our intellectual property. This IP can then be leveraged and sustained over the long haul with our new customers. </p>
<p>I’d like to thank all of our investors for their continued support. We’re finally in a position to start to see the returns of our work over the past four years. And at this time I’d like to turn over to the operator for any questions. Operator?</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p>Question-and-Answer Session </p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. Your first question is from Mark Gomes from PPT Research. Your line is open. </p>
<p><strong>Q - Mark Gomes</strong></p>
<p>Hey gentleman, congratulations on your recent activity. I was wondering if you could update us on the size of your SDI pipeline?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Total numbers we don’t really give out any specific for the whole pipeline. What we have is we have a number of different SDIs and we typically keep it just by continent that really are addressing each of the different continents. In order for the SDIs to be fully implemented, we have both, the ones that require new acquisitions. We actually have some that we are now pursuing that require no acquisition of new data but are just software implementations. So, it is going to be real hard to identify a specific on each of these SDIs because each one is very country and enterprise specific. And we don’t really like to give any kind of forecast on how much total. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so if we look at your current infrastructure, approximately how much revenue worth of typical SDIs do you think your business could support with the resources you have in place right now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>With just minimal hiring we think we can get over $200 million of revenue out of the organization. Remember while the software does not require substantially additions to the organization, we have multiple aircrafts that are ready to be flying all around the world. So that doesn’t really require additional personnel either. So we are really in a pretty great position for scaling this thing out to a good size of the company. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so you have a great deal, 200 million was the number, that kind of gives me the sense that your operating margins on these deals or incremental operating margins on these deals will be significant?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>I would agree with that. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, final question and I will let others chime in, what can you tell us about one, the geopolitical environment; and two, the duration of your sales cycles for these SDIs that has contributed to so much of this activity seemingly come to fruition at this point in time?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>If you want to talk about my political environment we will need a lot longer than this call for that one. But for the organization itself, as change occurs and actually things become more stable around the world, in regions that have not had a lot of rest. They all realize that they want to become what is deemed in the world of World Bank as an emerging country. And in order to get that category they have to have some level of infrastructure so that they can receive cheaper loans from the bank. </p>
<p>So, as really the competition around the world heats up, everyone is buying for this expansion capability and remember a lot of the geospatial content is used in the currency that these countries need in order to expand like mining, oil and gas, things like that. So, we are right at the forefront to help them and enable how to make money off of their local minerals that they may have to be exporting. So, right now you name the territories, everyone is trying to become a bigger part of the world's economy and when they want that we will be there first to help them develop a spatial data infrastructure so that they can manage all of these different types of commodities as they leave their country. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>You bet. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong> </p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. The next question is from Ross Weigel [ph] with Bank of Montreal. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning gentlemen. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Mohr</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Couple, just I wanted to tag onto the last comments that were made, regarding the type of country or sovereign nation that you would be able to help, so you mentioned specifically that Intermap's software and the general SDI spatial data that these countries would be able to use and collect information is one step that they would take towards building their infrastructure so that they are then at a level where they could then entertain IMF funding, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>That's accurate, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>So, does that suggest that the sovereign nation that you have the Letter of Award are yet to close would not currently be able to get that designation from the IMF?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>So it’s yes and no. So we have both cases that we are pursuing. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>The one, the Letter of Award let’s deal with that one specifically. Would that be currently in IMF sort of sanctioned country?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>They actually already received IMF funding.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so they are further along the line. Therefore the other one that we have been talking, the other elephant that we been talking in the room and hopefully is an elephant, would it potentially of a similar size to the Letter of Award that has been announced?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and I am not going to ask is it bigger or larger, if it’s just in the 10% or 15% ballpark that would be great. But that country therefore by your suggestion might not be at the stage to get the IMF recognition currently?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, but maybe for different reasons. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that’s cool.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Their SDI status, yes. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Would you be able say without specifically about that country or that contract what type of reasons might a country not be recognized, have that recognition for the IMF? What type of scenario, could you help us understand. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>This is where we start to get into a little bit of a slippery slope because we are very cautious to make sure that especially as we are pursuing these and have not won them yet we don’t get out our competition to start flooding the local governments with uncirculated proposals. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, I can understand that. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe in another couple of months. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Realize of course from my perspective I am trying to throw oil on the ground so it is slippery for you, but I don’t want to cause you any trouble. Okay, that being said you also mentioned 2600 companies for the InsitePro potential within the United States or North America?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Just the U.S. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Just for U.S. How many of those companies would currently be utilizing some of your competitor’s software?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Most. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Most? And so are you finding therefore that Intermap’s software is just so clearly superior or provides them with results what they cannot get from the competitors that you are starting to see some migration of those 2600 companies to or at least interest in migration to Intermap? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s accurate. So let me expand a little bit about that. In the flood area we used some of the most advanced flood modeling available in the U.S. especially along the coastal regions. What we don’t do yet and where our competition is better than us is the addition of other perils. And we are adding those perils to our application. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Could you explain what the peril and then the additional peril might be other than the –</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>A Peril maybe earthquakes, wind, you know, high wind, earthquakes. You think you can think of all of the biblical perils that are out there, all of them has to be modeled. Locusts has not been requested yet. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Would things such as I am calling from Ontario and two winters ago we had a massive ice storm that devastated great areas all up through the Ohio valley, etc. Would that type of thing be applicable?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, because one of the inputs into the system is real time weather and the ability to predict what kind of water, ice, hail is going to be produced for a region or where the storm actually moves. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so who is the ultimate client there, is it the reinsurer or the underwriter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>It really requires a tag team of both, because the underwriter will not underwrite unless he is able to get a reinsurer to back the approach. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so the reinsurer has to be convinced first, probably at the behest of… </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s the approach we’ve taken and that seems to get us in the doors the best. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Mohr</span></strong></p>
<p>And we both have to be looking at the same information. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>That is right, what is very important here is consistency and delivery, right. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>When the reinsurer goes in there he looks at -- he models a portfolio of lots of different properties. He liked to model all in the same way, whereas the actual underwriter looks at a specific process. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>So, to date you said that your competition is better at it, is that their software has the ability to do it better than yours or is it they have been better to implement or get to the client, in other words they have been able to close the deal better than you have?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Actually it is just they are more feature rich at this time. We have total access to all of them. In fact almost all of the clients that are out there, all those 2600, there are no close doors to us. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, do you have the ability to create new layers for your software to make it equal or surpass the competition and is it the question -- and this is a question of ramping up additional programmers, etc, etc. or is it the acquisition of the data from other sources to layer on to your software?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>So, what you have hit on is actually the cornerstone of our strategy. So, what this thing sits on is Orion. And Orion is a very flexible platform that you can just add new data and new analytics to. So, to answer your question specifically, to address the additional parallels unique analytics need to be created so it is more developers, programmers, and unique data layers need to be acquired of which we have already acquired all of the data layers needed to satisfy most of the parallels. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that is good, excellent. And as we all know with Intermap, the sell cycle for these deals be they possibly local within North America with some of these 2600 or the larger SDI international global contracts, the sale cycles is specifically internationally can be extensively long?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>That is accurate. The SDIs can take upwards to two years to pursue and win. Now the good news is, most of our InsitePro applications have been tricking closer to the three to four months. So, sales cycle is significantly different.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that is great. If you were to go out and just venture a guess two years hence, what split of InsitePro revenue would you say to SDI, what kind of mix -- overall revenue mix?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>I think the answer would be because the SDIs are still of so much larger magnitude that we would still probably be at about 30% of the vertical applications in two years, 70% SDIs. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that is great. And one thing that -- when the financials, when Rich was talking about the financials he mentioned that there could be potential more than -- I mean the award that we have, there are the other ones that we have alluded -- has been alluded to but it was suggestive to -- even theoretically a third or more closed by the end of the year. And in closing I guess that is final contract. The wording was such that we had previously hoped that this award, Letter of Award would be finalized in Q3, are we now looking potentially to Q4?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>No, just for the one that we have already received, we still believe can be done by the end of Q3 and resolving one additional one we believe that has enough history behind it to close during this year. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, but again that is in SDI and InsitePro. And the InsitePro must be ancillary that will just come along and be the icing on the cake?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Exactly, so there are many standalones themselves. Many of them we would anticipate would do another five or five to seven InsitePro's between now and the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, may I just address the Vertex for one moment please, Vertex has accumulated approximately I believe 19.9% or 20% of the company?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>That is correct. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, once the royalty deal that was done earlier in the year, done as a means of getting some funding and this current promissory note in the bridge [ph], is it a means of keeping the company going to an extent without going beyond the 20% because I am not sure the structure of Vertex but in Canada certain fund companies cannot hold more than 20% of a company, was that a concern that you know of?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Mohr</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it was. The another thing to remember when it comes to Vertex, I am just going to expand on that when it comes to Vertex, when Vertex stepped in the February timeframe and started providing debt to us that is definitely the definition of risk capital. And if you think about how much money they put in during the February, March, April Timeframe the amount of money they put in was very equivalent if not exceeding the market capital of the company. So theoretically –</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>But in the grand scheme of things it was really, really small relative to what they were able to get out of it potentially if that verdict be converted let’s say?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Mohr</span></strong></p>
<p>Exactly but during that period of time obviously there were still risks associated with this and there is still today. And the fact that they didn’t acquire the entire company when they probably could have, kind of gives you an indication of the way they look at Intermap and the fact that they do not walk on the company. That’s not the business they are in. And the royalty was a way of providing compensation when there weren’t any additional equity instruments available to them. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely and I applaud them for what they have done, it’s a good way of doing it, etc. At what point in time do you see their royalty potentially being converted to equity?</p>

<p>We don’t know that for sure. Vertex is a friend of the company. They have been absolutely fantastic to work with. Their intentions I know are not onerous in nature. I would assume that if there were a transactions that we had regarding that royalty it would be at some point in time when a portion of the debt has been repaid or at least all of it has been repaid. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, excellent. Well gentlemen I apologize I been monopolizing all the questions here. Thank you very much, I do appreciate your patience with your company because man, you probably had a number of sleepless nights and that award must have been -- you must hopefully you had a beer. Thank you very much. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Richard Mohr</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your patience. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And the next question is from Mark Gomes with PTT Research. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks again. You mentioned you are looking at five or seven InsitePro deal that could close before the end of the year, what can we expect as far as the average yield values for these types not specifically for the five to seven that you are discussing but in general?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>What you can imagine is it is still dependent upon the underwriter, how many users they have, and how many addresses they specifically need to evaluate. So if it ranges anywhere between 25k per user -- per company to 125k or greater if it’s a worldwide. If it’s a major it’s one of the nice things that we have here is that we are one of the few people in the world that have a worldwide flood model. So we are not limited to just the U.S. or just Canada or just South America. We can actually perform in Asia, Russia, China, you want to put a building in somewhere that is not fully developed yet, and you are going to try to get insurance on that building you are going to need something that’s going to be a help identify the amount of risk associated with that location. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great and finally going back to the SDIs for a moment, have you found that some of the early sales cycle that you engaged in that are now starting to come to fruition have created additional opportunities in the nations that surround the countries that you have been working in late stages? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely and in fact everyone that we talked to, we end up talking to all of the bordering countries because they don’t want to be left behind. I mean, this is paramount to really succeeding here and getting Intermap to be $1 billion organization is that each of these countries need to have similar types of infrastructure. And even better if they had the same type of infrastructure so they could share information if they were trying to build a larger economic power. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, and some of this translated to helping accelerate sales cycles and maybe given you the confidence that some of these deals will close before the end of the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the ones that are near term are beyond -- are going through their normal rate. The problem we run into is that, we are talking like for $125 million that is not where they just have that kind of money sitting around. So, it requires a government to actually get it into the budget, it then has to be negotiated. You may not get all of it in one year, it may require two years to actually get funding for the whole thing. So, that's what takes so much time. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, so, alright. So, when this deal closes, the implication is that they will have the financing in place and there will be a lock down?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>Exactly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Gomes</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. Congratulations again on the great progress. Hope to hear more on the weeks and months ahead. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd Oseth</span></strong></p>
<p>We would like to thank you. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong> </p>
<p>There are no further questions at this time. I will turn the call back over to you Todd Oseth, President and CEO for closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Todd Oseth</strong></p>
<p>We are pretty excited about what's happened in Intermap in the last quarter here. A lot of the things that we tried to put in place over the last few years really came to fruition. There is a lot of work left. These SDIs are very complex and we are dealing with some very large data and an awful lot of new types of organization. The risk organizations are the ones that we found to have the lowest hanging fruit for the organization. </p>
<p>We will continue to pursue vertical applications that pursue risk related opportunities. They work together, these SDIs help feed these vertical apps and these vertical apps are the ones that will keep us going on for the years because they have the nice, long software tails of maintenance and further development. </p>
<p>Again I want to thank all of you for participating with Intermap and I think that we are on our way. We are starting to see the strategy that we started a while ago while slow to implement but still was the right one to bring to market. Thanks again and have a great day. Bye, bye now. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong> </p>
<p>This concludes today's conference call. You may now disconnect. </p>
