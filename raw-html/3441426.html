<p><strong>Sam Kolias</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, James, and thank you everyone for joining us this morning. We are pleased to report on the solid second quarter for the Trust. Starting on Slide 4, some financial highlights for the three months in the second quarter and six months of 2015 include, total rental revenue of $120.7 million and $240.8 million, an increase of 2.4% and 2.7% respectively from the same period last year.</p>
<p>NOI of $76.8 million and $148.9 million, up 3.1% and 4.5% from the same period last year, funds from operations of $48.9 million and $93 million, an increase of 7.89% from last year, FFO per unit of $0.94 and $1.79 on a diluted basis, up 9.3% and 9.8% from last year and adjusted funds from operation per unit, which includes an estimated $500 per unit of maintenance capital per year of $0.86 for the three months ended June 30, 2015 and a $1.62 for the six months ended June 30, 2015, up 8.9% and 10.2% respectively.</p>
<p>Some portfolio highlights on Slide 5 includes overall occupancy for the second quarter of 2015 was down 110 basis points to 97.44% from 98.54% in the same period last year. The monthly average occupied rent realized, period ending for the second quarter, which includes ancillary income was $1,183 per apartment unit, up $30 from $1,153 per apartment unit in the same period last year.</p>
<p>Our Same Property second quarter performance for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 is as follows; rental revenues increased by 2.4% and 2.8%, overall operating costs increased by 1.6% and 1.1% and total NOI increased by 2.8% and 3.8%.</p>
<p>As Slide 6 illustrates, our rental revenues are cyclical in nature. Please note we have slightly changed the slide to more accurately and it illustrates the stages in the rental revenue cycle. As pictured in the slide the revenue cycle oscillates between this aftermarket with rising vacancy, increase in incentives and a decrease in rental rates to a balance market with selective incentives, lower vacancy and a balance in supply and demand to a strong rental market with increasing rental rates, lower availability and very few incentives. </p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2015, Boardwalk continue to witness its stable demand for rentals – our rentals across the major markets. Occupancy levels continue to remain high, although vacancy has increased slightly, and suite-specific incentives are up and rental rate growth is moderating.</p>
<p>The Edmonton and Calgary markets have moved into a period of balance. Revenues continue to climb although vacancy has increased slightly. It may reflect just how heated the Calgary and Edmonton housing markets were last year given that with the current economic contraction. We have only seen a slight rise in vacancy so far.</p>
<p>We believe our resident friendly, self-regulated pricing during last year’s heated housing market has also been a positive factor in mitigating the gains further vacancy in the Calgary and Edmonton market. We will continue to monitor all our communities and make adjustments accordingly to maximize occupancy levels in revenues. The Saskatchewan and Fort McMurray markets remain in the softer part of the rental cycle resulting in both the decrease in occupancy and increase in incentives in these areas.</p>
<p>Boardwalk continues to focus on customer service and lease renewals offering suite-specific incentives to mitigate the decline in occupancy in these areas Fort McMurray is 1% of our portfolio. In contrast, the Ontario and Quebec market continue their period of growth as a result of lower resource prices and lower Canadian dollar and lower borrowing costs, increasing demand in the Eastern rental market.</p>
<p>Moving on to Slide 7, there still remains a significant gap between the economic rent required for new rental construction and condominium home ownership in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Please note, the quality of condos is typically higher and this should be kept in mind when reviewing this chart.</p>
<p>Slides 8, 9 and 10 detail our net operating income optimization strategy and revenue strategy and highlights the Trust’s strategic balance between customer service, occupancy levels, market rents and operating costs, with customer service and occupancy being the primary focus.</p>
<p>Regardless of where the Trust markets are during the aforementioned revenue cycle, Boardwalk believes that continued focus on high occupancy, increased retention and our constant focus on customer service and quality is the key to providing the most stable long-term sustainable revenues and net operating income.</p>
<p>Increased retention and lower turnover reduces costs and increases net operating income. Boardwalk’s customer friendly, self-regulated rent control and the elimination of rental increases for customers that can prove financial hardship continue to drive higher occupancy, build goodwill and a stronger community.</p>
<p>Slide 11 shows our focus on quality and services being rewarded by higher occupancy and lower turnovers. Year-over-year, turnovers increased slightly and occupancy decreased slightly.</p>
<p>Slide 12, shows our average customer stay remaining at just over 3.5 years, reflecting more of our customers who are calling Boardwalk home. If you truly feel at home, where else would you want to live?</p>
<p>Slide 13, highlights the increase in both the Trust’s occupied and market rents relative to our last fiscal quarter three months ago. During the last month of the last quarter, the Trust’s average occupied rent has increased by $5 per apartment unit and by $30 per apartment unit since last year. This trend remains positive. The trend is spread between occupied and market rents has decreased from the previous quarter, reflecting a portion of market rents realized in occupied rents. Fort McMurray and Saskatchewan softening rental markets and a slight softening in the West End of Edmonton.</p>
<p>As shown in Slide 14, the Trust continues to have a slightly positive mark-to-market, with the average loss-to-lease totaling $10 per apartment unit per month. An illustration of the effect of a $25 increase or decrease to rents on FFO is shown on Slide 15.</p>
<p>Assuming net occupancy levels and operating costs remain the same, a $25 adjustment to rents would increase or decrease the Trust's FFO by approximately $0.20 per unit. The effect of an increase in expenses is also illustrated on this slide. Each 1% increase in expenses decreases the FFO per unit by approximately $0.03 using 2014 annualized expenses.</p>
<p>Chart on Slide 16, demonstrates occupancy versus availability. Our occupancy for the second quarter was slightly lower while our availability also decreased slightly. Availability below zero reflects rentals that will be occupied in future months. We believe that occupancy of 97% or higher, reflects our Boardwalk rental price volume. </p>
<p>Slide 17 reflects demand i.e. rental as compared to supply or also known as move-out and ties into our occupancy. In the second quarter seasonal move-outs have increased resulting in lower occupancy levels reflect in a more balanced market.</p>
<p>Slide 18 illustrates vacancy lots and incentives. Incentives in vacancy continue to increase reflecting softer Saskatchewan, Fort McMurray and Western of Edmonton market.</p>
<p>Slide 19 shows the results of the Trust’s customer move-out surveys. For the second quarter, turnover was up 6.9% relative to the same period last year. Moving out of town for the top reason for move-out of 47% increase and work related move-outs at 16% increase in larger accommodation and 35% increase in moving in with others all of which maybe our reflection of the slower Western Canadian economy.</p>
<p>Historically during past recessions doubling up is a short-term trend and reverses itself over time. Move-outs to purchase new homes came in second, decreasing by 7% this quarter. New housing is a significant alternative and our continued focus on building goodwill, quality and service are all essential. Skips are up only slightly by 1%. Rent too expensive has increased by 5%. Transfers within Boardwalk has increased 19% reflecting many residences continuing to choose Boardwalk as their home.</p>
<p>Slides 20 and Slide 21, show a softening economy going forward for Alberta to Saskatchewan. Multifamily starts are forecasted to decrease slightly for Alberta and Saskatchewan in 2015 compared to elevated levels in 2014. Single T-cap starts in Alberta and Saskatchewan are also starting to trend downwards slightly for 2015. Forecasted net migration remains positive, but as slowed as well.</p>
<p>Slide 22 illustrates the most recent unemployment statistics in Alberta and Saskatchewan. Both province’s unemployment rates have increased compared to the same period last year.</p>
<p>Slide 23 illustrates average weekly earnings as of the second quarter. Alberta’s workers continue to earn the highest wages in the country with average weekly earnings increasing year-over-year all other provinces also saw positive wage growth for the same period.</p>
<p>Slides 24 and 25 show the most recent migration numbers for Alberta and Saskatchewan. Migration for both Saskatchewan and Alberta are forecasted to be lower, with a weaker economy and more supplied multifamily units both forecasted for 2015 in Alberta. The rental markets supply and demand statistics reflect the movement to a more balanced market. Saskatchewan’s international migration has slowed and inter-provincial migration has moved to the negative.</p>
<p>Slide 26 shows the breakdown of major project investments in Alberta, which totaled $198.4 billion as of July 2015, down $0.7 billion over the last quarter, reflecting shelved upgrader projects. We continue to monitor the long-term capital being invested in Alberta as the leading indicator to future demand for housing.</p>
<p>As shown by Slide 27, land sale revenues for the province of Alberta relating to petroleum and natural gas continued to slow versus last year. Natural gas and oil prices have fallen and continued to be low and the Canadian dollars weaker which is a positive for the oil and gas producers who export oil and gas in U.S. dollars.</p>
<p>As depicted by Slides 28 and 29, the Alberta housing market has slowed over the last quarter. With single family home prices in Edmonton and Calgary down and condo prices stabilizing reflecting demand for affordability remains.</p>
<p>As depicted by Slide 30, the average residential sales prices stabilizing in Saskatoon and Regina.</p>
<p>Slide 31 illustrates the implied cap rates in relation to our unit price. Over the last quarter, our public market evaluation has dropped, resulting in a widening gap between the implied cap rate represented by our current unit price and the cap rate that quality assets have sold out on the private market.</p>
<p>Stock and bond markets continue to be volatile. The slide includes the IFRS value rental revenues and expenses, used to calculate the implied cap rates on a per share basis and compares the Trust valuation net of $1.66 of cash per unit.</p>
<p>We continue to review our portfolio. Our current public market valuation continues to represent exceptional value when considered against the current replacement costs, other consumer housing options like condominium ownership and current valuations on private market transactions.</p>
<p>I would now like to pass the call on to Bill Chidley who will provide more details on our newest projects. Bill?</p>
<p><strong>Bill Chidley</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Sam. Low interest rates continue to fuel investor appetite for apartments. Cap rates for well-located, better quality properties remained at compressed levels. We have lowered our estimate of cap rates for Southwest Ontario given our recent sale of Windsor.</p>
<p>Moving onto the next slide. We are unconditional on the sale of our Windsor portfolio, which consist of 1,685 units in 23 buildings. We estimate that the taxable income and non-taxable portion of capital gain as a result of this sale to be in the range of $0.90 to a $1 per Trust unit.</p>
<p>This taxable income and non-taxable portion of capital gains may be distributed to unitholders and, if so, must be declared before December 31 to ensure that the Trust has distributed all of its taxable income in any given year. Any special distribution as a result of this sale will be announced prior to the end of 2015 we are set to close on September 10, 2015.</p>
<p>Moving onto the next slide. The first phase of Pines Edge Estates consists of 79 units located on our existing property, Pines of Normanview. The building is now completely framed, roofed and sealed. Exterior cladding is underway and interior finishing has commenced.</p>
<p>Electrical and mechanical rough-ins are approximately 65% complete with insulation and drywall approximately 30% complete. Anticipated completion of this phase is Q1 of 2016 and is expected to cost approximately $14.1 million or $178,000 per door, which equates to a $179 per square foot buildable and $209 per square foot rentable.</p>
<p>We are estimating the stabilized cap rate to range between 6% and 6.5%, excluding land. Including the appraised value of approximately $12,000 per door for a land, the cap rate would be reduced by about 40 basis points. We have factored in some market rent decline in this analysis reflecting the possibility of continued market weakness. This four storey wood framed elevator buildings will have one level of underground parking. There are 30-1 bedroom and 66-2 bedrooms which 60 have two baths.</p>
<p>Moving on to the next slide. This slide highlights our other development opportunities. In Calgary, a rezoning application was approved by City Council to build 200 additional units at Sarcee Trail Place. We are exploring various concept plans for two point towers and phasing of the development. Once we receive detailed drawings we will access the economic viability of this project.</p>
<p>In Edmonton, we received approval from City Council for the RA9 zoning in January of 2014. The city is currently working on a text amendment to increase the FAR on all RA9 zones to five FAR, which would allow us to build 312 additional units on this site. City planners expect this text amendment to be ratified by City Council.</p>
<p>We submitted an application to rezone one site in Calgary, we anticipate feedback from the city later this year. We have one major site in Regina that we consider a strong candidate for master planning. These sites could achieve substantially higher density but would require substantial demolition.</p>
<p>I would now like to turn it over to William Wong. William?</p>
<p><strong>William Wong</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Bill. Slide 36 shows computation of FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015 versus the same period of last year and is calculated using profit from continuing operations as shown in our consolidated statement of comprehensive income prepared in accordance with IFRS.</p>
<p>Reported Funds from Operations or FFO, a performance measure not defined by IFRS, but that better reports the overall operational performance of real estate entities, for the current quarter was $48.9 million, up 7.8% from the amount reported in the same period last year and on a per unit basis, increased by 9.3% from $0.86 to $0.94. The increase was primarily driven by organic rental revenue growth primarily in Alberta and Ontario, lower utility expenses and lower financing costs.</p>
<p>For the six months ended June 30, 2015 FFO was $93 million, compared to $85.3 million for the same period last year and increased of 9%. On a per unit basis FFO was $1.79, up 9.8% from the $1.63 of the same period in the prior year. Again, due to higher revenue lower utility costs and lower interest costs.</p>
<p>The next slide, Slide 37, shows a reconciliation on a per unit basis of FFO for the three and six months ended June 30, 2015, from the FFO per unit amounts reported in 2014. As the slide shows, NOI growth from our stabilized properties and a decrease in financing costs, contributed $0.05 each to the FFO growth for the current quarter compared to the same period in the prior year. </p>
<p>This was partially tampered by the FFO loss on the sale of West Park Ridge and our BC property portfolio, which were sold in May of last year and higher administration related to our associate transition payment. For the six months ended June 30, 2015 same- property NOI growth and financing cost savings contributed $0.12 and $0.08 respectively to our FFO growth partially tampered by higher administration and the loss for FFO our sold property.</p>
<p>The next Slide 38 provides an overall review of our rental operation performance for the current quarter and for the first six months as shown in our income statements. The current quarter revenue from continuing operations, including ancillary rental income like coin and laundry for the current quarter was higher by approximately $2.8 million, or 2.4% compared to the same period in the prior year, primarily due to higher average rental rates in Alberta and Ontario while maintaining high occupancy levels.</p>
<p>Total rental expenses for the current quarter increased approximately $460,000 or 1.1% from $43.5 million to $43.9 million, primarily due to higher property taxes partially offset by lower utility expenses.</p>
<p>Utilities were lower due primarily to lower natural gas expense. Property taxes were higher by approximately $360,000 or 3.7% due to higher property tax assessments. The net result is that overall net operating income or NOI for the current quarter increased $2.3 million or 3.1% compared to the same quarter in 2014. Operating margin at 63.6% for the current quarter increased slightly from the 63.2% for the same period in the prior year.</p>
<p>Slide 39 shows our breakdown of capital, we reinvest back into our investments property portfolio. This capital investment is categorized between repairs and maintenance, on-site maintenance, personnel costs, maintenance capital, stabilizing and value enhancing capital investments and property, plant and equipment purchases or PP&amp;E.</p>
<p>Repairs and maintenance and on-site maintenance personnel costs are expensed when incurred since they are regular and ordinary expenditures necessary to maintain the operating condition of a property in the short-term.</p>
<p>Maintenance capital investment is capitalized and related to maintaining the existing earnings capacity of our property portfolio. Stabilizing and value enhancing capital and PP&amp;E expenditures, which are more discretionary in nature are capitalized and focuses on increasing the productivity and/or earning capacity of our properties.</p>
<p>For the second quarter of 2015, Boardwalk invested and expensed an average of $413 per suite on R&amp;M and on-site personnel costs and capitalized approximately $525 per suite on stabilized investment property improvements. In addition, Boardwalk expanded approximately $2 million or $58 per suite on PP&amp;E.</p>
<p>For the first half of the current year, Boardwalk invested and expensed an average of $824 per suite on R&amp;M and on-site personnel costs and capitalized approximately $941 per suite on stabilized investment property improvements. Boardwalk also expanded approximately $3.5 million on PP&amp;E.</p>
<p>The next slide, Slide 40 provides a breakdown of our operational capital improvements and capital asset additions for the first six months of 2015. The Trust reinvested back into its portfolio, a total of $36.1 million, comprised of $32.6 million on a stabilized investments property and $3.5 million on property, plant and equipment, compared to a total of $34.5 million for the same period in 2014.</p>
<p>Included in the amount to reflect Boardwalk’s internal capital program is approximately $8.8 million of allocated on-site wages and salaries in certain parts and supply compared to $8.3 million capitalized for the first six months of 2014. Not included in the pie chart for the first six months of 2015. Boardwalk invested $4.9 million in developments compared to $0.2 million for the same period in 2014. As well as $3.1 million for the acquisition of the Nun's Island office and warehouse in the current year.</p>
<p>Our Slide 41 shows, total overall admin costs which includes operating and corporate G&amp;A, for the first six months of 2015 was $29 million, an increase of $1.8 million or approximately 7% from the $27.2 million for the same period last year. The increase was due primarily to higher salaries and wages, higher profit-sharing accruals and the transition payments to our associates.</p>
<p>I would now like to turn the presentation over to Rob Geremia. Rob?</p>
<p><strong>Rob Geremia</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, William. Slides 42 and 43 focus on our stabilized portfolio. At June 30, 2015, with the exception of the redeveloped 109-unit complex in Calgary, Boardwalk’s entire apartment portfolio was classified as stabilized.</p>
<p>For the second quarter, revenue on these properties increased by 2.4% as compared to the same period last year with operating cost increasing by 1.6%, resulting in an NOI increase of 2.8%. For the six months ended June 30 stabilized revenues increased by 2.8% while operating expenses increased by 1.1% resulting in NOI increased of 3.8%.</p>
<p>As is noted on this chart, the significant increase in the expenses reported in Saskatchewan was a result of increased utility prices as well as the inclusion of a new cost related to the inclusion of TV and Internet as part of our rental products offering in Saskatchewan which is not present at the prior year.</p>
<p>Slide 43 shows the sequential revenue on our stabilized properties over the last four quarters. The second quarter reported an increase of 0.6%, when compared to the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Slide 44 documents the Trust’s continued strong liquidity position, with $87 million in cash at June 30 and additional $85 million in committed subsequent financing and a $196 million line of credit, the Trust has $368 million of available liquidity. This represents 16% of total debt outstanding at the end of the quarter. Boardwalk’s debt as a percentage of reported investment property asset value was 38% after adjusting for cash.</p>
<p>Slide 45 reports the Trust’s total debt maturity schedule at the end of the second quarter. Since the end of the second quarter of 2015 we have seen the Government of Canada Benchmark Bond yields fall as compared with what we witnessed during the third quarter. These Benchmark Bond yields back down close to the historical levels lows we witnessed in Q1 2015. These decreases have a lot of Trust and continue to renew and expand its debt portfolio and rates substantially below the maturing rates.</p>
<p>At June 30, the Trust’s overall weighted average in-place interest rate was 3.16%. A rate that is 76 basis points above the current NHA 10-year rates of 2.4% and 146 basis points above the current five-year rate of 1.7%. A particular note is that for the remainder of fiscal 2015 and fiscal 2016, the Trust has over $500 million coming due at rates well over 100 basis points over the existing market rates. Boardwalk's remaining mortgage amortization under these insured loans is the next of 30-years.</p>
<p>Slide 46 provides the reader with our estimate on our current mortgage underwriting valuations. Boardwalk’s balance sheet continues to be conservatively levered at 44% after deducting our current cash position. Our special note is over 2000 currently have no outstanding mortgage encumbrances.</p>
<p>Slide 47 and 48 provide additional detail on Boardwalk's mortgage portfolio.</p>
<p>Slide 47 shows the Trust’s interest coverage on a four quarter rolling basis continues to increase to over 3.55 times, the highest in our reported history. Boardwalk’s secured mortgage portfolio is over 99% insured under the current NHA insurance program. The use of this insurance has two unique and distinct benefits which sits in addressing the two distinct financing risks, these being interest rates and renewal risk.</p>
<p>With respect to interest rate risk, the NHA insurance provides us the benefit of a very advantageous interest rate. With this insurance we are able to obtain very competitive interest rates, which are currently at approximately 75 basis points to 90 basis points over the corresponding Benchmark Bonds.</p>
<p>Renewal risk has substantially increased with this insurance and that once obtained, it’s good for the entire amortization of the mortgage, which in most cases is 30 to 40 years and the insurance is transferable to other approved lenders long-term maturity.</p>
<p>Slide 48 provides the summary of our 2015 mortgage maturities. At June 30, the Trust has renewed its forward loss 73% of the maturing mortgages with a weighted average renewal interest rate of 2.31%, as compared to the maturing rate of 3.56%. The average term on these renewals is eight years. The estimated annualized savings on these renewals is $5.1 million.</p>
<p>Slides 49 and 50 focus on Boardwalk’s investment fair value calculations.</p>
<p>Slide 49, shows Boardwalks’ reported fair value at June 30 on its investment properties was $5.7 billion close to the amount recorded in Q1 2015. Listener should know that these charts exclude our Windsor portfolio the sale of which is to close in September.</p>
<p>Slide 50, visually reports the NOI and cap rates used in the determination of the Trust fair value of its investment properties.</p>
<p>Slide 51 highlights the capitalization rates used in determining the fair value of these investment properties. And overall the weighted average capitalization rate used in the determination of the fair value was 5.44% at June 30.</p>
<p>Slide 52 details the two key variables in the termination of these estimates, net operating income and capitalization rates. As is noted, a slight shift either negatively or positively in these estimates could materially affect the reported amount.</p>
<p>Slide 53 highlights Boardwalks’ normal course issuer bid. During the Trusts previous normal course issuer bid the Trust acquired a total of 470,100 Boardwalks’ Trust units for cancellation on the open market. The average price of these units was $67.01. The funding of the 2014 NCIB gain from the portion of the net proceeds generated from the sale of our BC properties.</p>
<p>The cap rate on these property sales was significantly lower than the implied cap rate on our Trust unit prices that kind of acquisition. The Trust has legally renewed its course issuer bid and will be allocating funds from the recently reported sale of Windsor assets to system funding in the current year. To date we have not acquired any additional Trust units as the Trust is in blackout until market close today.</p>
<p>Moving on to slide 54, Boardwalk’s 2015 financial forecast. Consistent with prior periods on a quarterly basis the Trust reviews reported financial guidance. This review consists mainly of comparing the actual reported results to those assumptions used in determining the reported guidance. Based on this review and previously announced the sale of its Windsor portfolio set to close September 2015, we are adjusting down the top end of our FFO and AFFO guidance ranges.</p>
<p>For 2015, we now expect an FFO range of between 3.48 to 3.52 and an AFFO range of between 3.15 to 3.29. Although it is our intent to fund the – the current NCIB fund the sale of our Windsor portfolio to assist in offsetting the loss of the FFO from the Windsor transaction there will be a timing issue in the short term on this process, which may impact 2015 reported results.</p>
<p>As a result reduction in the top end of our guidance relates to the loss of the FFO from our Windsor portfolio for the period after the close of transaction in September. All other key assumptions remain unchanged and are as follows; no new acquisitions or dispositions during the forecast period, the development project in Regina will not to be completed in 2015 and as such will have no impact on the financial results. And stabilized building NOI should increase as compared to prior years but between 1% to 4%.</p>
<p>Side 55 to Slide 58 highlights our capital budget. For 2015, we anticipate a total operating capital budget of $98.8 million with an additional $12.2 million in development. As is noted, our internal estimation of the amount of capital referred to as maintenance capital continues to be estimated at $500 per apartment per year.</p>
<p>Slide 56 provides the break-up of our 2015 capital and where it is targeted to be invested.</p>
<p>In addition for your reference Slide 58 provides more detail on the determination of maintenance capital. On average for larger capital projects such as new roofs and exterior upgrades are amortized over 12 years, while specific suite capital and our internal capital program are amortized over 3.5 years, rates which approximate the average customer stay at Boardwalk.</p>
<p>Moving onto Slide 59 Boardwalk’s distributions. As is customary at each board meeting, the Board meeting Trustees review the Trust unitholders distributions. As a result of this review, the Board has decided to maintain its regular distribution at $0.17 per Trust unit monthly or $2.04 on annualized basis.</p>
<p>This concludes the formal part of our presentation. We'd like to open it up for questions now. Aaron?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Frederic Blondeau from Dundee Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Frederic Blondeau</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you and good morning. I think you actually answered my question. But just to be sure, in terms of the revised guidance, you considered a cash – you're using the cash to buy back units, right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>As Bill mentioned there will be a taxable income capital gain and taxable income on the transaction in the fourth quarter we will determine how much exactly that will be, but at this point in time we are allocating funds for from the net proceeds after adjusting for that to the NCIB, but we have not adjusted guidance assuming we’re buying back aggressively during this rest of the period.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Frederic Blondeau</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. And any chance you’ve been working on your guidance for 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>Not yet, that comes out of Q3 Frederic. Our teams are just starting from the ground up now to develop those numbers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Frederic Blondeau</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, got it. All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>Great. Thanks, good morning guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Rothschild</span></strong></p>
<p>Just following up on that question -- we should assume that there's no impact on 2016 due to that sale because the unit buyback should offset much of that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">William Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we’ve assume that the timing maybe also – we’re not quite sure yet, so we had the reduction of our top end of our guidance was the direct result of approximately $0.03 loss for the FFO from Windsor for the rest of 2015 are intended to be in their buying stock back, because there is a lot of variable left over one forecast of time. What’s the incurred price going to be? How aggressively we are going to buy? What can we do? So to be safe in that category – take off the FFO from our Windsor - the loss from our Windsor FFO and see how this goes as the rest of period goes on.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Rothschild</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. And with regard to the asset sale, is the selling asset, then, in Ontario a sign that you're more bullish on Alberta perhaps than others are? I realize that maybe you didn't have this marketed for sale, but I'm sure you could have sold assets in Alberta if you would have liked to fund asset sales. Is there something we can infer from that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">William Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I mean Windsor was an unsolicited offer, the portfolio was non-core and it was an unsolicited offer at 26% above our IFRS value over trading at the lower IFRS value. So rather than a common on Ontario is really, it was a particular Ontario market that was non-core and we received what we thought was an excellent offer. So it was talking advantage of an opportunity that was presented. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Rothschild</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. And just one more question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">William Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it’s fair to say we are in the long run optimistic about Alberta, but this was not driven by – it was more of an opportunistic exceptional offer that we have responded to.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Rothschild</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thanks. Just one more question, although it may be two parts. In regards to the IFRS NAV that you referenced – is that what you believe is a true NAV for the Company? And then secondly, on the IFRS NAV, just maybe you can help us reconcile the difference in the operating expenses and maybe also the revenue between the IFRS value and the current run rate for NOI that you have? There's a big difference in the operating expenses. Maybe you could just reconcile that for us?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rob Geremia</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it’s Rob. Yes, historically to dealing with IFRS, cap rates use and the termination was actually been high as compared to market transitions. There is a debate either way you want to go on that, but IFRS volume is a fair value, not a fair market value.</p>
<p>So we do assume – we do believe that the rates are actually too high however the transaction base will go with that. The reconciliation on the expenses and determining the NOI for fair value versus Boardwalk members is quite different. Over half of the expenses that are used in determining IFRS value are standardized cost not actual cost.</p>
<p>So they are somewhat lower than ours, so there will historically been a difference between the two. It varies by year, it depends which – where we as a company as a whole this will experience increase from particular expenses where the standardized cost will not change that much.</p>
<p>Generally our revenues tend to be that higher than you see the IFRS numbers because our forecast periods for the year where as IFRS takes the current market rent the way it is today and simply annualizes that. So there always going to some discrepancy. Longer run you should see the IFRS numbers and our numbers combine into much, much closer than they are today.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Rothschild</span></strong></p>
<p>So maybe just following up on that, the operating expenses is quite different than your current operating expenses. Are you saying that the IFRS NAV is inflated relative to what your current NAV might be, based on your actual operating expenses?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rob Geremia</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the determination of the IFRS NOI is based on an industry standard kind of model. So somebody else came into operating they might operate differently than we do. So it’s very difficult to determine if somebody else came in and operate what would the NOI be versus us. I think IFRS has to standardize the methodology in doing so there is a substantial difference. What is the exact amount? When we sell a property we look at it, we do at the entire way as well. So not just odd numbers looks to be, purchaser also look how they would operate it. So there really is no way that merge the two at one time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Rothschild</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thank you very much.</p>

<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Heather Kirk from BMO Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Heather Kirk</span></strong></p>
<p>With the occupancy for the portfolio having come off, I think, a further 75 basis points according to your July 1 number, I guess I have a two-part question. Where do you see that trending through the end of the year, and maybe through 2016? And does $40 oil change your views on where you're situated in the cycle?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Heather, in a balanced market historically the occupancy drops further as the winter comes in because any balanced market the demand versus the turnover and supply is less so we can expect further erosion in occupancy levels going into the winter season so that we have seen in the past. I’m not sure what oil is going to do, but if oil continues to be very low the economy will continue to be very soft.</p>
<p>And historically what we’ve seen in a very, very soft oils market and economy is big contraction in construction of new condominium in whole and we started sell by about 43% as occur Herald news articles the other day. And so the huge volatility is in construction starts and as definitely what we are seeing and that usually offset a great deal of less demand in the marketplace, because again we remind everybody our biggest reason for move-out or if it’s not is our second is buying home condominium. So we are already seeing a drop in that.</p>
<p>And so again historically we’ve seen steady reaction to the slow economies because everybody needs to live somewhere and our rents are very affordable and so affordability becomes heightened factor not just quality and service so in our slow economy our rents that we’ve strategically kept as low as we possibly could in a heated marketplace we will continue to provide this all results and we are not really surprised and we continue to deliver solid results in our core markets.</p>
<p>Because our strategy work and we’ve been here before and that’s why we’ve adjusted our strategy during hot healthy markets to be conservative and disciplined in keeping increases as low as we possibly can to spread out our performance over many years to have sustainable revenue growth not volatile revenue growth and so that – again the biggest volatility is in the high-end.</p>
<p>New construction, condominium rental in a soft market is where the volatility shows up. If you look at our same-store rental Fort McMurray is the perfect example use to trend around $1900 now like $1700 and going to $1500 and so you can see that the drop in the highest rents in our portfolio which is Fort McMurray and again that supports our experience in the past where is the biggest drop in rents are always at the high-end and one of the biggest factors in the slower economy is affordability and that’s where we have really focused and we believe we are at and that’s why we continue to deliver solid results.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Heather Kirk</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Just turning to the balance sheet you’ve been that the five-year I think it’s somewhere around 72 basis points, would you be considering moving sort of more of just shorter-term five-year money versus 10-year you’ve been favoring?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rob Geremia</span></strong></p>
<p>Heather it’s Rob, if you look at our maturity schedule the combination across the whole averagely so couple of – obviously the rates are important in fact if you look at the hotspot in the market we also look at our maturity curve and what we can fill in the gaps there. So I probably say no, we are not going to be looking shorter probably still try to trend longer if we can, but if we can find some really interesting rates in between we’ll take those as well too.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Jonathan Kelcher from TD Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Kelcher</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, good morning.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>

<p>Good morning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Kelcher</span></strong></p>
<p>Just turning back to the Windsor sale for a minute here. So it looks like you're going to net about $115 million on the sale after you pay back debt, and potentially pay out around $50 million or so in a special distribution. Would it be fair to assume that the remaining $60 million or so, the majority of that would go towards your NCIB?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">William Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, currently right now, we are allocating a significant portion of that to the NCIB. The timing of the acquisitions of those shares will vary, but we’ve always said we are much more comfortable swapping equity for equity on the transaction and what Windsor sale was for us with an equity release.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Kelcher</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Just On the NCIB, will you wait until that sale closes? Or will you be active more as soon as we come out of the blackout here? I know it's not a big timing difference.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">William Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we will be active, we are comfortable if the sale will close, that's unconditional, as time and the vendor is a very reputable vendors. So we are not as concerned about that. So will use some of the cash or balance sheet right now to assist until the actual closing time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Kelcher</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just on development, have you guys had any thoughts or discussions about getting involved in any mixed use-type developments with a partner, with a JV partner?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, Jonathan. We are always looking at opportunities and we believe mixed use is a great potential JV opportunity and then about finding the right partner in the right location and the right development. So yes, we look at federal capital reality I think it’s a called or mixed use REIT out of the United States and have huge success and mixed use is very sustainable as far as live, work and play in the same area. So we believe it’s a very sustainable way to go and what the future is going to favor as the result of congested traffic or vehicular arteries and congested traffic in developed cities and so yes we absolutely believe that's a potential and are looking for ways in considering and hoping for ways to do this, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jonathan Kelcher</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. I’ll turn it back.</p>

<p>[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Alex Avery from CIBC World Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Avery</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Just a couple of questions on your move-out tracking statistics. You showed that you had, I guess, a jump in a few different things. But one that was interesting and maybe counterintuitive was the transfers within Boardwalk being up 19%. Have you guys taken any time to look a little bit deeper into that, and maybe what that might relate to?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">William Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s a combination of lot of the above, but transfers conceivably moving between cities which we’ve seen some of that. Transfer can be moving from one unit to another unit or location to location. So we’ve seen a number of size changes. Almost fairly equal with respect to needing more space, i.e. to a one to a two bedroom or a two bedroom to a one bedroom kind of idea in that area, we’ve also seen an increase in the number of people are transferring between cities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>Alex, when we hired our Director of Community and Corporate Culture. We specifically back in 2012 wanted to build a better brand and we believe we can always build a better brand and improve on our brand. First and far most our biggest asset is our people so we have been really focusing on building a better team that build a better relationships with our resident members and surrounding communities and thereby improves our brand.</p>
<p>And the director asked a number of years ago how we can measure the success of building our brand in a better culture and better communities. And the answer is we measure it internal, but we measure it in the amount of time our resident spend with us. We can remember the last time even in a slow contracting economy when our resident had stayed with us as long as they are staying with us today. So we are very happy with our team and especially our director at corporate and community culture on building that better brand and our results are reflecting that and we strongly believe that a big reflection of a better brand.</p>
<p>Our customers are referring ourselves to other customers and family members and also staying with us and showing us with their feet how much they like Boardwalk and so this is why we continue and we are quite unique in measuring turnover. We are not really aware of any other company that measures and reports turnover and average length of state on a quarter-over-quarter basis in other residential multifamily company and we hope others will follow soon and start to measure that as well and report on that as well, but that’s what we really also believe as a big factor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Avery</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That's quite helpful. And then just one other, maybe nuanced point -- but when you announced the sale of the Windsor portfolio, there was some wording in that press release that talked about potential uses of capital. It was very similar to the wording that you've used in other publications, including your 2014 annual report. When I read that, it sounded like, at the time, you were perhaps a little bit more cautious or tentative on the redeployment of the proceeds into the normal course issuer bid. But today on the call, you're very clear that it sounds like you're almost chomping at the bit to get active on the normal course issuer bid. Am I reading too much into that? Or have you perhaps in the last month become more confident in that redeployment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Rob Geremia</span></strong></p>
<p>Alex, this is Rob. I wouldn’t say more I think we do the press release it’s simply an allocation of capital calculation and we always want to leave ourselves open to say, okay, there might be some other areas of allocation of capital development of others that might be. But we do a press release more of a long-term structure. So that was a little while ago.</p>
<p>Today as we see it now we can – we still see the best opportunities to buy our stock back. Does that change tomorrow? Possibly. Does price go up significantly? Does Bill come with another opportunity? We evaluate on a regular basis on simple allocation of capital. So, right now, yes, I wouldn’t say we're chomping at the bit, but we do anticipate to be in the market soon to be acquiring some stock back and we will continue that until this time as we find another opportunity that’s better.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>And Alex our board is very involved with our strategic plan and asks us every quarter to maximize the choices to deliver on our strategic plan and continue to deliver on solid predictable performance and so our Board is a strong believer in the maximization of choices to deliver on our strategic plan and this is why our press release essentially reflects the belief of our Board in that the best strategic plans are ones that have the maximum amount of choices.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Avery</span></strong></p>
<p>Sounds like at your Board meeting for the quarter, NCIB came out on top.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sam Kolias</span></strong></p>
<p>Well you know actions speak louder than words. So I mean I guess that will all show in our actions, in our insider reports that come out as the ensuing weeks and months follow.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Avery</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That’s great color. Thanks guys.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Matt Kornack from National Bank Financial. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Kornack</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, guys. Just quickly, expanding on Alex's point, I also noticed that you've up-financed and added mortgage to a previously unlevered property. Would you use that capital as well for buying back units? Or is that for capital investments and other sorts of investments?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">William Wong</span></strong></p>
<p>At this time, we’re not allocating that capital I think that’s an opportunity for us. We saw some chance there. It was a really competitive rate to get some additional liquidity for maybe future opportunities that could come up. At this time, we do not foresee allocating that cash outside of the short-term period between now and the actual close of the Windsor transaction to the program itself.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matt Kornack</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great thanks. That’s it for me.</p>
