If you have not received the news release or would like to be added to the company’s distribution list, please call SANUWAVE at 678-578-0103 or go to the Investor Relations section of our website at www.sanuwave.com.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I would like to caution that comments made during this conference call by management will contain forward-looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties regarding the operations and future results of SANUWAVE. We encourage you to review the company’s filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, including without limitation our Forms 10-K and 10-Q which identifies specific factors that may cause actual results or events to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the content of this conference call contains time-sensitive information that is accurate only as of the date of the live broadcast, August 12, 2015. SANUWAVE undertakes no obligation to revise or update any statements to reflect events or circumstances after the date of this conference call.</p>
<p>With that said, I would like to turn the call over to our Chairman of the Board, Kevin Richardson.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Lisa. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us. The second quarter has been a busy and productive quarter for SANUWAVE. We met or exceeded all of the milestones we established on our prior call. We had a great meeting with the FDA, which Pete will discuss. We renegotiated our debt with HealthTronics, which showed their strong support for our company and belief in their technology. We presented positive results with SANUWAVE Technologies at the Biofilm Conference at Montana State which Iulian will discuss along with an increase in our patent portfolio with the use of our shockwave technology in the oil industry. We will also discuss continued research in the new applications with the University of Georgia and Montana State University.</p>
<p>Lastly, the increase to shares authorized from 155 million to 355 million. On this last accomplishment, let me be clear, the authorization is not intended to be fully utilized, but needed to be in place to offer flexibility when pursuing potential financing alternatives or strategic alternatives. When we get authorization similar to life insurance never intended for use, but have to be in place. Finally, you are well aware, we are focused on balancing our time and funds on the initiatives that can create significant shareholder value in the near-term and longer term. We will conclude the call today with Q&amp;A, but prior to that, we will list our objectives for the next 90 days.</p>
<p>With that, let me turn it over to Lisa to review our Q2 2015 results.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Sundstrom</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Kevin. Revenues for the second quarter of 2015 were $240,000, an increase of $1,000 or 1% from the prior year. Revenues for the six months ended June 30, 2015 were $450,000, an increase of $67,000 or 18% from the prior year. The revenues result primarily from sales in Europe, Asia and Asia-Pacific of our orthoPACE and dermaPACE devices and related applicators. The increase in revenues for 2015 is due to higher sales of orthoPACE devices in Europe, primarily in Italy as compared to the prior year as well as the higher sales of new applicators with the new devices.</p>
<p>Research and development expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were $457,000, a decrease of $557,000 or 55% from the prior year. These expenses decreased $687,000 or 39% to $1.1 million for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease in 2015 is a result of lower costs for clinical sites participating in the dermaPACE clinical study as there were fewer active patients in the clinical study as compared to the prior year.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2015 were $637,000, a decrease of $58,000 or 8% from the prior year. These expenses were $1.2 million, a decrease of $792,000 or 40% for the six months ended June 30, 2015. The decrease for 2015 was primarily due to higher consulting expenses in 2014 related to the capital raises completed in March of last year. This decrease is partially offset by increased legal fess in 2015 related to patent filing.</p>
<p>Net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $1.5 million or $0.02 per share compared with a net loss of $1.7 million or $0.03 per share in 2014, a decrease in the net loss of $172,000 or 10%. Net loss for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $2.7 million or $0.04 per share compared with the net loss of $4.3 million or $0.10 per share in 2014, a decrease in the net loss of $1.6 million or 37%. The reduction in the net loss for 2015 was primarily a result of the reduced operating expenses in 2015 which I just discussed.</p>
<p>Looking at the cash flows, as of June 30, 2015, we had cash on hand of $1.6 million compared with $3.6 million at December 31, 2014. Net cash used by operating activities was $1.9 million for the first half of 2015 compared with $4.1 million for 2014. The decrease in the 2015 cash used for operations was primarily due to lower operating expenses in 2015 and a reduction of accounts payable and accrued expenses in 2014. We continue to project that our cash burn from operations will be approximately $400,000 to $500,000 per month in 2015 during the patient follow-up phase of dermaPACE clinical trial.</p>
<p>Now let me turn the call back to Kevin Richardson for a business review.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Lisa. I will have each of senior members of the management team discuss their respective areas, so now we will have Pete Stegagno, our VP of Operations and Regulatory Affairs walk you through the status of the dermaPACE clinical trial. Pete?</p>
<p><strong>Pete Stegagno</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Kevin and good morning everyone. In our dermaPACE diabetic foot ulcer trial, clinical trial update call of June 30, we reported that the trial had been close to further enrollment and that SANUWAVE is working with the individual clinical sites to finalize all trial data. The intent of this effort is to be able to walk the database. And what we mean by walking the database is to essentially ensure that the contents of the trial database cannot be modified by any means in order to ensure data integrity. These efforts are serious and that stringent quality control reviews are conducted towards identifying missing data fields where data is expected and to identify redundant or conflicting data and to correct such data.</p>
<p>For example, sites and our patient visit data into two platforms, one for the pictures taken of the wound at each visit and the other for the electronic database. If there are conflicting dates entered into the two platforms, the dates have to be reconciled to one correct entry. Pleased to say we are 95% complete in the data cleanup effort and we are on target for database lock by the end of August. Once we have locked the database, top line analysis will begin and we expect to have primary and key secondary objective results in September.</p>
<p>We are really excited to finally have reached this point in the trial. It’s been a long time coming. This is really the combination of two trials the first having begun enrollment in 2007. While in that trial we did not meet the primary objective of significantly different rates of complete wound closure at 12 weeks post initial treatments as compared to the same control group. We did see significant and clinically meaningful results. We did see a statistical significance for wound closure at 20 weeks and beyond. We also saw significant improvement in wound area reduction at 12 weeks and later as well as rates of wound closure and decreased rates of wound recurrence and amputation.</p>
<p>We began our current supplemental clinical trial in 2013. The clinically meaningful results in the first trial we use to build a protocol and statistical analysis plan for the current supplemental trial. This current supplemental trial is a result of working with FDA to design a statistical plan using Bayesian principles to take advantage of the dermaPACE treatment benefit that was established in our previously conducted pivotal study. Bayesian designs are supported by the FDA where there is strong prior clinical evidence that can be incorporated into the clinical study design. This statistical plan incorporated the prior positive information regarding complete wound closure after one treatment cycle to bear on the design of the supplemental study. Under this patient design an independent data monitoring committee or DMC was setup in order to review primary efficacy results at predefined patient enrollment milestones during the course of the trial.</p>
<p>The purpose of the DMC was to determine the difference in rates of complete closures and each group at 12 weeks are indicative of study success. The DMC also reviewed safety data. The DMC has now met twice first in August 2014 after the 90th patient completed the initial 12-week efficacy phase of the trial. The second meeting was in May of 2015 after the 130th patient completed the initial 12-week efficacy phase of the trial. In both cases, the DMC came back to us with the finding that the rates of wound closure between dermaPACE and Sham at 12 weeks did not meet the predefined monitoring success criterion.</p>
<p>In layman’s terms, the difference of the rates of wound closure between the two arms of 12 weeks was not sufficient to declare success. The DMC did confirm that there is no safety concern with the device when used for diabetic foot ulcer treatments. In the meantime, we met with FDA this past June to discuss our proposals for additional analysis of wound closure after 12 weeks and up to and including 24 weeks. We also proposed various covariant and subgroup analyses. The FDA stated they are onboard with our plan to analyze these additional secondary objectives. The key takeaway from this meeting was that there is precedence of FDA approving devices via PMA, pre-market authorization based on the totality of the data. And what this means is that even failing to achieve a primary objective if other data including the secondary end points. So the clinically meaningful outcome the FDA will still review a PMA submission and can still make an approvable decision.</p>
<p>As I stated earlier, we expect to have top line data analysis complete in September. Depending on the results of these analyses, we expect to complete the PMA submission process to FDA by end of Q4 of this year or early first quarter of next year 2016. Again after a very positive meeting with FDA in June, we are very encouraged that should the results of the second trial at least mirror that of the first trial we can provide the compelling clinically relevant set of results in the PMA for FDA’s consideration for approval. Our statistical plan incorporating Bayesian principles which include positive results in the first trial in the analysis of the current trial in essence combines the results from the two trials into one analysis.</p>
<p>For other news, we continue to see steady results for orthoPACE device sales primarily in Italy and South Korea. We continue to work with our partners in Canada and Australia to make inroads in these markets for dermaPACE primarily through device placement in key clinics. Respected clinicians in these countries are beginning to use the device and are coming away impressed that dermaPACE can be an effective low cost modality in the management of chronic wounds. Having these key opinion leaders onboard with us will help in furthering our market penetration.</p>
<p>And with that said, I will turn it back over to Kevin.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Pete. We look forward to talking again mid-September to discuss our top line results. Next we will update you on recent developments on medical and non-medical uses for our patented technology. Let me turn it over to Iulian Cioanta, our Head of Research and Development. Iulian?</p>
<p><strong>Iulian Cioanta</strong></p>
<p>Good morning to everyone. Thank you, Kevin. The results of the tests from the Center of Biofilm Engineering from Montana State University on Staph and pseudomonas biofilms showed a lot of reduction in between three and four, which translate in 99.9% or 99.99% reduction removal of the biofilm. We presented these results into posters and also had a lab demonstration during the conference on biofilms held at Montana State University on July 14 and July 16. We are very pleased to report that the posters and the lab demonstration raised a significant interest from medical and non-medical companies present at the conference. We have translated in an invitation to present our technology at 3M to both medical and non-medical business units.</p>
<p>Also, we started business contacts regarding industrial and medical biofilm removal with other participants at the Biofilm Conference, companies that are interested in finding solutions for their specific biofilm problems. Our work at University of Georgia on vascularization has continued with successful results. In the time that passed from our last conference, we confirmed the stability of our microbiology technique. Practically, we do not add any new bacteria during that harvesting three-month analysis.</p>
<p>To assess the interest of shockwave from bacteria besides culturing bacteria after shockwave treatment, we are starting to use fluorescence-activated cell sorting, which is called FACS, to more accurately and perhaps to quantify bacterial killing. Our experiment will continue to use E. coli and staph, which are bacteria responsible for many infections and are tough to kill. We continue to expand our patent portfolio also regarding the shockwave technology. We recently received U.S. patent number 9057232 related to the use of shockwave generated with laser systems for hydraulic fracturing of rock formations, which can be employed in both secondary and tertiary oil recovery. This is sending its first pattern for the energy industry that itches the use of lasers for generating shockwaves, which offers a much more longer use for life and lower required maintenance for the shockwave devices deployed deep inside the oil bores. This feeds the needs of low maintenance systems required by the energy industry applications.</p>
<p>With that being said, I am turning back to Kevin. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Iulian. Lisa will now summarize the progress we have made internationally. Let me turn it over to Lisa.</p>
<p><strong>Lisa Sundstrom</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our international sales growth has continued with the revenue up 18% this year from last year. This was due to increased sales of our orthoPACE devices in Italy, which has always been a key market and the use of our technology for treating tendinopathy such as for the knee and shoulder pain. In South Korea, in conjunction with our exclusive distributor, we have been working with the regulatory authority for device approval for our dermaPACE device. A distributor already has approval for orthopedic device to orthoPACE. We will continue to provide updates on these efforts as they continue to progress. Kevin?</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Great. Thanks, Lisa. As you just heard, the second quarter had many accomplishments of which we are proud. So, we must now look forward to what we have to expect in the near-term, which we defined as prior to our next quarterly conference call. First, we will be announcing our top line results of our supplemental study in the second or third week of September. As you are well aware, we are blinded to the data are in the process of un-blinding currently, but we do know the DMC had told us we will not meet our primary endpoints of 100% closure 12 weeks with statistical significance relative to the champ.</p>
<p>The top line data will help us understand and shape how to proceed with our submission of the FDA. Based on our meeting in June which Keith discussed, the FDA is well aware of our DMC finding and still recommends to proceed with the submission. We remain confident that we will find success in our PMA submission. Second, assuming decent top line data, we will begin the submission process with our PMA to the FDA. Third, based on the success of our top line data findings, we will either have completed a joint venture partnership or sale of the wound product or concluded the capital rates to complete the FDA trial successfully and begin the commercialization of the product. We are very excited about bringing a unique novel cost effective and patient friendly product to the market that surely needs innovation. As we have stated before, when the product is approved we think adoption will be quick, because the patient will benefit from the convenience and ease of application and the fact there is no surgery to physician benefit, because we will make more money on its time spent with the treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, payers will benefit as the pricing is much more competitive in currently available offerings in the advanced wound care market space. Finally, as I mentioned on the last call, we are hoping that by year end we will be in a position to announce the joint venture partnership in the non-medical space. The steps taken at Montana State, Georgia and other university settings are setting us up well to have those discussions with large strategic partners.</p>
<p>I will stop here and we are happy to answer any questions that you may have. I will open up the call to your questions. Operator?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question today is coming from Brian Marks. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Marks</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Kevin. In the meeting with FDA, did they provide any specific answers as to what potential additional information or data or statistical analysis that they will consider or was the feedback more of that they won’t necessarily disqualify a dermaPACE approval based on this primary endpoint?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Good question. I am going to kick it over to Pete, but it was really talking about the totality of the data. And some of the review team that we have is new relative to our past non-approval. And so there was a lot of discussion about covariate and secondary endpoints and really the message we got was that we know states and their question is can we show that it’s effective and will clinicians use it? And so with that, let me turn it over to Pete, but I think the totality was the answer that we heard and our consultants heard as well. So, Pete?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Pete Stegagno</span></strong></p>
<p>Alright. Yes, we didn’t get that far in the discussion with FDA this time around. The crux of the meeting was to discuss in addition to the currently defined primary objective and some of the currently defined objectives secondarily for wound area of reduction and monitoring amputation rates and such. We also proposed additional covariate analyses, subgroup analyses and additional secondary analyses that based on the first trial we saw results and we want to analyze again and see how the second trial reflects those first trial results. What you are asking will definitely occur in the next stage of meetings with FDA. As we submit the PMA, we will also be submitting the top line data to FDA for their review in what’s called the pre-PMA meeting. You might have the different terminology now, but it’s prior to submitting the final clinical results, we will have another meeting with the FDA. And in that meeting, they will probably recommend additional analyses. So, that remains to be seen. And it will all be based on what we submit for results.</p>
<p>But as Kevin said, there was definitely a positive flow of information between ourselves and with FDA and they definitely are showing that there is a difference in how FDA views submission as compared to even five years ago with our first PMA. In that as Kevin stated, it’s the totality of the clinical evidence and providing that there is good clinical evidence in there, they look at the evidence in the context of that risk benefit approach. And that’s why we are really excited of the fact that we have been extremely safe to buy FDA themselves put it in writing, the first time around that they saw no safety issues with the device. So, we have got a very safe modality of treatment. It’s a treatment that can be of the lower cost compared to what’s out there now.</p>
<p>We have already seen in the first trial some significant results in the management of wounds, which most clinicians are as interested in as well as much as just closing a wound. They are looking at being able to manage them to reduce any risk to the patients. So, we are very excited with knowing what we have in the first trial and expecting at least similar results this time around to be able to present a very compelling submission to FDA.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Marks</span></strong></p>
<p>So, when you unblind the data and you look at it and you do the analysis from the supplemental trial here in September, there is going to be decision that you need to make relative to whether you go ahead with filing the PMA, correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Marks</span></strong></p>
<p>So with FDA without real specifics in terms of what they are going to need what are your decisions kind of based on when you look at the data, how do you make that decision based on that you don’t know exactly what FDA is going to be looking for, whether you go ahead with the PMA submission?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, it’s Kevin. I think from where we sit today if we have similar results for the first trial meaning statistical significance to 20 weeks and statistical significance that a few other secondary endpoints like wound area reduction or certain size of wounds, certain age of wounds, something that can show statistical significance at an endpoint along with some of the other indications on assistance and management of the wound. I think that’s where you will see us move forward with this submission. Based on our conversation June 6 or June 7 or whenever it was in June that we met with them, the message we got was you are still going to need to show some statistical significance with from your secondary endpoint you can’t just be – you are not doing anything. You have to show something that we can work with. And so I think you will see us really focused on where our results are relative to the last trial and if they are in that same thing given our safety profile, given that we did the supplemental, given that it will be 336 patients at that point, we are going to move forward. If not, then the answer is no, I mean, for whatever reason, again we are still blinded for whatever reason it’s not there, then you will see us not move forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Marks</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And one more, so assuming you do file the PMA, how much capital do you think you are going to need to get to the point in time or FDA mix or decision because presumably if FDA comes out and says approved, then its easier to raise capital and its easy to raise more money and its kind of cheaper to do so, so how much money do you think you are going to need between now and FDA decision?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>So we are heading on two paths. And I think we have been pretty clear with people for a while now that our preferred path is to work with another wound care company who can work with us and ultimately be the distributor, commercialization partner of the product. And in that case, we will probably moved up our timeframe relative to what the originally we are thinking and the original thought was get approval and then go talk to everybody. I think where we are today is that we are working to partner with someone to work through the FDA process with us. And we are having good discussions with various folks about that. Ideally if someone who has wound care sales force and understands the technology and understands that it’s a big market opportunity and this is one of the new innovation that’s coming to market and so that’s the first and foremost where we are looking.</p>
<p>And as you know Brian, no one is going to sign up until they can see the top line data because if it’s bad, no one is going to – no one is going to do a joint venture or a distribution dealer or acquisition without knowing what they are buying. So we are going to have to wait until mid-September for a lot of this to happen. And then we are going to move relatively quickly. As far as the raise goes, we know that the cost to complete the submission with the FDA is about $1 million or $1.2 million, somewhere in that range. Our burn rate at this point we are projecting to $400,000 to $500,000. That should come down potentially next year and then quite frankly we’re beginning to see a little traction on the sales front, I don’t think it’s going to be big enough to make a huge difference, but some of the international markets that Lisa alluded to are beginning to perk up a little and that would be a beneficial as well. I would say that the minimum we will need is probably $4 million and it will probably be somewhere in that $4 million to $6 million range. And again, I am not saying anything out of school, these are you can kind of back into the answer it’s going to take us until third quarter next year to get approval and we know what our burn rate is. So, you can kind of back into the number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Marks</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question today is coming from Scott Goldstein. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Goldstein</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks there. Sorry for getting off tangent, but when can we see the use of the shockwave technology for oil fracking?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, this is Kevin. We have had some discussions with partners at length. When patent got issued, we had some inbound calls. We are doing some follow-up work now. And so I would expect some time, my guess is by the end of the year we will have found someone to work with on that. And again, we are not commercially yet. So, we are still in the ramp up kind of custodies and we have devices that we didn’t bring mobile to a site, but we are still I would expect maybe by year end something on that front and the discussions that have been good, but I would say it’s still a few months off.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Goldstein</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for clarifying that. Looking forward to it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question is coming from Jim Roberts. Please proceed with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim Roberts</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning everybody. If the FDA results are positive in September, can you elaborate on your plans from monetizing that technology moving forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kevin Richardson</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, it’s Kevin. There is two different paths on that. And I will go through both. One is working with the partner, finding whether it be a joint venture outright sale or partner that probably be some form of upfront payment. There would probably be milestone payments or royalties after that. And so that’s the plan we are moving down is slightly again utilizing our R&amp;D, utilizing our patent portfolio and working with someone who didn’t establish sales forces. In the wound care stage, there is a few big guys and then there are some emerging players that are ramping their sales forces pretty dramatically. And so in there is what I would call a lack of new product and new innovation is that the last technological innovation was negative pressure. You have seen some graphing products on the wound care side. There is some other gels and honeys that are out there, but as far as the technology goes, the ideal partner for us is someone who has an existing sales force. They can bring this into their sales force and ramp it quickly, because we know the profitability on the product even when priced well below the current offerings out there and advanced wound care is still extremely healthy for whomever we partner with.</p>
<p>So, I would look for us to do either a joint venture or partnership. It will have some former milestone payments on royalties. And my guess is it’s going to be very determined on FDA approval. So, whomever we partner with, we will not be taking on as greater risk until we get FDA approval and we feel as you have heard very good about FDA approval. If we don’t get any opportunities on the table that we think are worthwhile for shareholders or strong enough for shareholders, we will begin the commercialization plan ourselves. That would mean bringing in some folks from the Head of Sales, the work on reimbursement and we have a whole strategy and go-to-market plan upon approval. So, you would see us head in that direction and try to capture the market ourselves, but I will be clear. I mean, our first approach is to find a partner that can really leverage their existing infrastructure and sales force back office to bring it to market quickly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim Roberts</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. We have reached the end of our question-and-answer-session. Let’s turn the floor back over to management for any further or closing comments.</p>
<p><strong>Kevin Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Great. Well, thank you everyone very much. It’s been like I said a busy second quarter. We are remaining busy and have a lot of activity going on. We are excited about where we sit specifically after our FDA meeting. It gave us the encouragement to move forward with posing the trial, so we can submit to the FDA. We will be talking to you again probably in about a month and updating you on where we stand with our top line data. In the meantime as we have laid out, we have got a lot of non-medical initiatives that we are moving forward on that Iulian alluded to. The international markets seem to be heating up a little and then we will definitely be in touch with regard to our top line data. So, thank you very much. And as always if you have any questions, please reach out and we will get back to you. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. That does conclude today’s conference. You may now disconnect your lines at this time and have a wonderful day. We thank you for your participation today.</p>
