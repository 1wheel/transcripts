<p>Good day, ladies and gentlemen, and welcome to the Briggs & Stratton 2015 Quarterly Earnings Release Conference Call. At this time, all participants lines are in a listen-only mode to reduce background noise, but later, we will be conducting a question-and-answer session, and instructions will follow at that time. As a reminder, this conference today is being recorded.</p>
<p>I would now like to turn the conference over to your first speaker for today, Dave Rodgers. You have the floor, sir.</p>

<p>Good morning, and welcome to the Briggs & Stratton fiscal 2015 fourth quarter and year-end earnings conference call. I'm Dave Rodgers, Chief Financial Officer, and joining me today is Todd Teske, our Chairman, President and Chief Executive Officer.</p>
<p>Today's presentation and our answers to your questions will include forward-looking statements. These statements are based on our current assessment of the markets we operate in and actual results could differ materially from any stated or implied projections due to changes in one or more of the factors as described in the Safe Harbor section of yesterday evening's earnings release, as well as our filings with the SEC. We will also make reference to certain non-GAAP financial measures during today's call. Additional information regarding these financial measures including reconciliations to comparable U.S. GAAP measures is available in our earnings release and in our SEC filings.</p>
<p>This conference call will be made available on our website and via phone replay approximately two hours after the end of this call.</p>
<p>Now, here's Todd.</p>
<p><strong>Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone, and thank you for joining us today. As we look back on our performance for fiscal 2015, we can clearly see the improvement in our financial results from our focus on executing our strategy over the past few years.</p>
<p>Our fiscal 2015 fourth quarter consolidated net sales increased $42 million, or 8.5% to $539 million from the fourth fiscal quarter of 2014. This increase would have been 10.4% without the impacts of foreign currency due to the stronger U.S. dollar. A more normal start to the spring lawn and garden season compared with the last three years along with growing our share of engines and outdoor power equipment contributed to the increase despite inventory levels being elevated in certain parts of the channel coming out of last year.</p>
<p>Our fourth quarter profitability also improved and had improved significantly. Adjusted net income in the quarter was $23 million, an increase of 58% over last year. Adjusted diluted earnings were $0.51 per share, a 65% increase from $0.31 per diluted share in the fourth quarter of fiscal 2014. Margins improved in both the Engines and Products businesses from new product introductions, migrating our product portfolio to higher margin products, and the relentless focus on executing our cost reduction plans.</p>
<p>For the full fiscal year, on a constant dollar basis, net sales increased $65 million, or almost 4%. Net of the currency impacts, we reported consolidated net sales of just under $1.9 billion, an increase of $36 million, or about 2% higher than fiscal 2014. In addition to the acquisitions we made this year, we had higher sales of engines, commercial lawn and garden equipment and pressure washers.</p>
<p>These gains were offset in part by foreign currency headwinds, lower Snapper sales due to narrowing our lower margin product assortment and lower sales of portable and standby generators as it has been relatively quiet on the storm front to serve as a growth catalyst for these categories. Full-year earnings also significantly improved in fiscal 2015. Adjusted net income for the year increased by $26 million or 66%, and adjusted earnings per diluted share was $1.42, a 73% increase over fiscal 2014 adjusted diluted earnings per share of $0.82.</p>
<p>Looking back on fiscal 2015, it was a year of execution of our strategy delivering on our commitments in many ways. In the Engines business, we held or grew our market share in all of our key markets. We had great success launching new products. New engine introductions included our EXi engine where users don't need to change the oil, just checking that oil to simplify engine maintenance. We launched our new InStart lithium-ion push button starting system in Europe this year, with extremely favorable consumer reaction and sales volumes exceeding our expectations.</p>
<p>We also expanded our share in the commercial markets. Following up on our success of launching an all-new Vanguard 810cc commercial engine last year built from the ground up for commercial cutters, this year we introduced a lineup of Vanguard commercial engines with electronic fuel injection, delivering up to 25% fuel savings for commercial cutters.</p>
<p>We improved the profitability of our business. Fiscal 2015 adjusted consolidated operating margins improved by 170 basis points compared with the prior year. Adjusted gross margins improved in both business segments this year, the Engine segments by 80 basis points and the Product segment by 230 basis points. These improvements are despite a 40-basis-point headwind from foreign currencies.</p>
<p>The Product segment turned the corner on profitability this year without any help from storm-related generator sales. Adjusted segment income of $7 million this year reflects a $23 million improvement from the adjusted segment loss last year. And that improvement would have been even larger at almost $29 million had it not been for the foreign currency headwinds we experienced this year. We diversified our product portfolio by expanding our products of higher margin products. This was accomplished by executing on two acquisitions this year, Allmand completed at the end of last August, provided an entry for us to the higher margin commercial categories within the job site and rental channels. Billy Goat completed at the end of May 2015 provides us with higher margin complementary products for our Ferris and Snapper Pro commercial cutting lineups.</p>
<p>We executed on our plan and narrowed our lower margin Snapper line of products to simplify our product lines and concentrate on higher margins in our dealer channel. We are on schedule with moving the McDonough facility into our Munnsville, New York and Milwaukee, Wisconsin facilities with total restructuring cost in line with budget and with $10 million of savings achieved in fiscal 2015 which is ahead of schedule.</p>
<p>New innovations in the Product segment also helped us gain share. Our Briggs & Stratton POWERflow+ pressure washer launched last year continues to help us grow our market share in the U.S. The introduction of lithium-ion battery-powered handhelds and mowers sold under the Victa brand in Australia extended Victa's leadership position with an outdoor power equipment in Australia.</p>
<p>Dave will talk in more detail about the financials in a minute but it's worth noting that we hit our commitments with respect to cash flow this year as well by exceeding our goal of taking an additional $20 million to $30 million of working capital out of the business excluding the acquisitions.</p>
<p>Operating cash flows increased with the continued focus on being more efficient with working capital. We've maintained a disciplined balanced approach using our cash. In addition to reinvesting in the business and completing the strategic acquisitions, we returned $70 million of cash to our shareholders via share repurchases and dividends, which we increased 4% one year ago. In addition, yesterday our board authorized an additional 8% increase in the dividend.</p>
<p>Briggs & Stratton also continues to be recognized for the great work of our employees, that our employees do each and every day. In May, we were recognized by the Reputation Institute as one of the most reputable companies in the United States as published in Forbes Magazine. The U.S. RepTrak 100 rankings measured the public's perception of companies based on seven dimensions: innovation, leadership, governance, citizenship, workplace, performance, and products and services. We are honored by this prestigious award, which is a tribute to all the efforts of our employees who work daily to provide high-quality products, and who proudly represent our company within our communities.</p>
<p>In June, Briggs & Stratton was recognized as the manufacturer of the year by the Equipment and Engine Training Council, or the EETC. The EETC is a non-profit association made up of industry professionals, including manufacturers and dealers that work to train and educate technicians in the outdoor power equipment industry. Briggs & Stratton believes dealers, manufacturers and consumers of outdoor power equipment industry need knowledgeable, qualified technicians to ensure power equipment is serviced properly, which is why as a leader in outdoor power equipment and engine expertise, we will continue offering highly innovative solutions and learning resources that will make a huge difference in the education of current and future technicians as well as consumers.</p>
<p>We are also pleased to be recognized for all the great work that our service and support team does each day.</p>
<p>With that, I'll turn it back over to Dave to provide you with some additional financial details on the quarter and our fiscal 2015 results before we wrap up with our outlook for next year. Dave?</p>
<p><strong>David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Todd. Engine segment sales for the fourth quarter were $352 million, an increase of $34 million, or 11% over the prior-year quarter. Units shipped in the quarter surged by approximately 500,000 units, or 25% over the prior year to approximately 2.5 million units shipped in the quarter.</p>
<p>While currency negatively impacted sales by approximately 2% compared to last year, the remaining delta between units and sales volume in dollars relates to a much higher mix of small engines sold for walk-behind mowers relative to larger engines with higher average selling prices that are used in riding mowers. In fact, the vast majority of the increase in units shipped year-over-year in the quarter was for smaller engines.</p>
<p>Fourth quarter Engines' adjusted segment income was $33.9 million, an increase of $9.9 million or 41% from the prior-year quarter. Sales volume increases and higher margin rates prior to currency impacts contributed to the improved performance.</p>
<p>Adjusted gross margin rates for the quarter were consistent with last year at about 22.2%. Benefits of slightly lower commodity cost and the impact of the retirement plan changes were offset by unfavorable foreign currencies and unfavorable mix of engines produced.</p>
<p>Engine production in the quarter was up by about 3% over the prior year to just over 2.1 million units in the quarter from just under 2.1 million units last year. However, the number of large engines produced decreased from the prior year, reducing the absorption benefit on those engines.</p>
<p>For the full fiscal year, Engine segment sales on a constant dollar basis increased about $5 million. Total units shipped in fiscal 2015 were slightly above 8.3 million units, an increase of approximately 3% from 8.1 million units in fiscal 2014.</p>
<p>The favorability in volume was offset by a lower mix of large engines which have a higher average sales price relative to smaller engines. Engine's adjusted segment income for fiscal 2015 was $94 million, an increase of $12.1 million, or 15% from fiscal 2014.</p>
<p>Adjusted gross margins were 22.2%, an increase of 80 basis points from fiscal 2014. The improvement in the margin rate was due to retirement plan changes of 90 basis points and material and cost reduction actions of 50 basis points. This was partially offset by unfavorable currencies of 40 basis points and unfavorable mix of units produced of 10 basis points related to the mix of production slightly skewing towards small units rather than large.</p>
<p>Total engines produced in fiscal 2015 were approximately 8.2 million units, an increase of about 100,000 units or 1% from 8.1 million units in the prior year. We ended the fiscal year with approximately 1.1 million engines in inventory, a decrease of approximately 180,000 units or 13% from the prior year, as we continue to work on managing our working capital more efficiently.</p>
<p>Product segment's net sales in the fourth quarter were approximately $212 million, an increase of $6 million or 3% from the prior-year quarter. Acquisitions and higher sales of lawn and garden equipment and pressure washers were offset by lower sales of portable and stand-by generators and unfavorable foreign currencies.</p>
<p>Products adjusted segment income for the quarter was $2.2 million compared with an adjusted segment loss last year of $1.3 million. Adjusted gross margins of 13.4% increased 70 basis points from the prior-year quarter. The improvement was related to cost reduction and restructuring savings of 130 basis points and improved mix and pricing of 90 basis points as we continue to migrate our product portfolio to higher-margin SKUs.</p>
<p>Partially offsetting the improvements were reduced fixed cost absorption of 130 basis points and a 7% reduction in manufacturing throughput in the quarter, and a reduction of 20 basis points related to foreign currencies.</p>
<p>For the full fiscal year, Product sales were $789 million, an increase of $53 million, or approximately 7% from last year. While acquisitions added approximately $60 million of growth, we also saw growth in higher-end dealer, residential and commercial lawn and garden, as well as pressure washers. Offsetting these increases were the planned reduction in sales related to the narrowing of our lower-margin Snapper SKUs, lower sales of generators in the absence of storm activity, and approximately $14 million of unfavorable foreign currencies.</p>
<p>As Todd discussed earlier, the Products segment improved significantly over fiscal 2014, as adjusted segment income for the year was $7 million, an improvement of $23 million from last year's adjusted loss of $16 million.</p>
<p>Adjusted gross margins for the year improved to 14.6%, an increase of 230 basis points from last year's 12.3%. Acquisitions improved gross margin rates by approximately 90 basis points. A favorable mix of higher margin products added 104 basis points, restructuring savings was a benefit of 30 basis points, and a 13% manufacturing throughput improvement added 60 basis points.</p>
<p>Partially offsetting these improvements were unfavorable foreign currencies of approximately 90 basis points. It's also worth noting that the U.S. Products business reduced inventory by 13% in fiscal 2015, excluding inventories at the acquired companies.</p>
<p>The balance sheet continues to be strong to support our strategic priorities moving forward. We ended fiscal 2015 with total cash on hand of $118 million and net debt of $107 million. Our net debt increased $76 million over fiscal 2014, primarily related to using $88 million for the Allmand and Billy Goat acquisitions.</p>
<p>At the beginning of our fiscal year, we estimated that we would positively impact our cash flow from operations by $20 million to $30 million by reducing working capital, and we exceeded that target, excluding the working capital of the acquired companies.</p>
<p>Cash flows from operations were $148 million, an increase of 17% over the prior fiscal year. Excluding the impact of acquisitions, accounts receivable, inventory and accounts payable goals were reached such that just over $40 million of working capital requirements were reduced compared with last year.</p>
<p>We increased our share buyback in 2015 by 9% and repurchased an additional $47 million of common shares outstanding during fiscal 2015 and paid $23 million in dividends. We still have approximately $40 million of share repurchase authorized through the end of our fiscal 2016.</p>
<p>We did not contribute any cash to our frozen pension plan in fiscal 2015 and we do not currently estimate that we will be required to do so for the next few years. Total average leverage and last 12 months EBITDA as defined by our credit agreements was $262 million and $156 million, resulting in a leverage ratio of 1.68 times, which is lower than last year and well within our debt covenants and provides us with adequate liquidity moving forward.</p>
<p>That concludes what we wanted to say about the fourth quarter financial results. So I'll turn it back over to Todd for our thoughts on fiscal 2016.</p>
<p><strong>Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</strong></p>
<p>Looking forward to fiscal 2016, we remain committed to creating shareholder value by executing on our strategy to grow the Engines business, focus on higher margin opportunities and grow our international business, especially in those emerging markets where we have not had a significant presence.</p>
<p>In 2016, we will continue to deliver new and innovative products to our customers, complete our restructuring actions to improve the profitability of our Products business and grow Allmand and Billy Goat which are already successful businesses. We will also focus on simplifying our business to take out cost and make us easier to do business with around the globe.</p>
<p>Our financial outlook for fiscal 2016 contemplates higher sales and improved organic earnings with some non-operating, year-over-year headwinds impacting earnings. We anticipate fiscal 2016 sales to be in a range of $1.9 billion to $1.96 billion. We anticipate organic growth of 2% with our expectations of the markets in the U.S. and Europe to grow 1% to 3%.</p>
<p>Overall, inventory levels in the U.S. appear to have improved during the course of this season such that inventory levels are closer to normal. Indications are that retail has continued to perform well later in the season. We will know more about channel inventories in October.</p>
<p>European inventory levels appear to be at normal levels to slightly up in certain regions. We also anticipate sales being higher by another 2% due to the acquisitions closed in fiscal 2015. Offsetting organic and acquisition growth totaling 4% are the headwinds of nearly 2% related to foreign currencies, with the U.S. dollar being stronger in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015, and the reduction of the Snapper SKUs that were liquidated during this past season. We are currently in discussions with our major customers regarding lineups and engine placements for next year. Our forecast does not contemplate material changes in our engine placement for next season. As always, we will provide an update on engine placement in January.</p>
<p>We estimate that fiscal 2016 net income will be in the range of $54 million to $61 million, or $1.20 to $1.36 per diluted share, excluding the impact of additional share repurchases or the remaining costs to complete our previously announced restructuring programs.</p>
<p>The earnings for fiscal 2016 reflect a return to a more normalized tax rate of 32% to 34%, which represents a reduced benefit of approximately $0.14 per diluted share from fiscal 2015. In fiscal 2015, we recorded tax benefits for favorably concluding a U.S. tax audit and for recognizing incremental R&D tax credits for previously filed fiscal years. In addition, similar to other U.S.-based manufacturers, we are estimating net unfavorable foreign currency impacts of $10 million pre-tax, or $0.15 per diluted share in fiscal 2016. The currency impact is net of several actions we are taking, including pricing increases in certain regions to offset these significant currency trends.</p>
<p>Also in fiscal 2016, we are required to adapt new mortality tables to value our pension liability that will increase pension expense by approximately $0.06 per diluted share. Organic and completed acquisition growth, as well as continued progress on the product restructuring and focus on cost reductions are offsetting these headwinds. In fact, after factoring out the tax benefit that will not recur, the FX headwinds and the required pension changes, the midpoint of our earnings range for fiscal 2016 contemplates approximately 20% growth in earnings from operating factors that we control compared with fiscal 2015.</p>
<p>While we don't provide quarterly forecast, there are a couple of things to keep in mind as you look at this year's quarters. First, there will be production timing changes in fiscal 2016 compared with fiscal 2015. As a reminder, we needed to move up engine and products production to earlier in our fiscal year last year due to launching the new EXi engine and producing engines and pressure washers in advance of the McDonough facility closure. The impact of this pre-production on margins was broken out in each of our quarterly reports last year.</p>
<p>Second, when comparing fiscal 2016 to fiscal 2015, currency impacts on sales will be relatively more significant in the earlier fiscal quarters due to the trending of actual FX rates over time and the impact of our currency hedges becoming less favorable as the year progresses. Impacts of FX were also broken out in our quarterly reports.</p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate engine sales in Q1 to be impacted by approximately $10 million to $15 million due to adequate channel inventory of snow product in Europe and lower snow engine placement in the U.S. for the upcoming winter.</p>
<p>From a cash flow standpoint, we will continue to focus on improving our working capital metrics to the benefit of operating cash flow with the largest opportunity to reduce inventories. We anticipate generating additional cash from working capital reductions of $20 million in fiscal 2016. We are not required to contribute to the pension plan in fiscal 2016 or fiscal 2017.</p>
<p>Lastly, we anticipate that capital expenditures in fiscal 2016 will be in the range of $65 million to $70 million as we continue to invest in new products, manufacturing efficiencies and technology update projects in fiscal 2016.</p>
<p>That's the end of our prepared comments. And now we'd like to open up the call for questions.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our first question comes from the line of Josh Borstein from Longbow Research. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh A. Borstein - Longbow Research LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey. Good morning, Todd and Dave. Congratulations on a nice quarter and strong finish to the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Josh.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh A. Borstein - Longbow Research LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Just a few questions on the guidance. In terms of the implications for the margin for the upcoming fiscal year, where do you see most of the improvement coming from? Is it gross, is it operating expenses, and in which segments? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, Josh, I expect that the operating margins will improve slightly year-over-year. They'll be in a range that, again, is probably 10 basis points to 20 basis points higher than fiscal 2015. We expect that we'll get continued benefit from the restructuring programs that we'll be finishing related to narrowing the product SKUs of Snapper. We are a bit ahead of schedule on that. We over-achieved our goals for that by about $3 million in fiscal year 2015. We continue to estimate that our total savings from those programs will be in the area of $15 million to $20 million. By the time we get to the end of it, we forecast that we're going to get somewhere in the area of an incremental $5 million to $6 million of benefit during fiscal year 2016. So that will be part of it.</p>
<p>We'll continue to have cost reduction programs that are focused in both the Engines and the Products business, and then we'll continue to have new product introductions that help us to achieve higher margins. Again, what we're focused on there is to proliferate the innovations that we've come to market with already across a wider range of SKUs. And so as we do that, we anticipate getting some margin lift over the next few years, and that'll be another source of lift for us.</p>
<p>So I think you'll see, on the whole, continued improvement in the Engines business as well as in the Products business year-over-year. As Todd said in some of our prepared remarks, I just caution you on the timing of production and the impact that that can have on margin rates on a quarter-to-quarter basis. We've tried to be very transparent with respect to the amount of absorption benefit that we've had in each quarter. For example, if you go back to last year's first quarter, the Engine business was pre-producing engines in advance of the EXi engine launch, as well as producing engines for pressure washer production in advance of moving the McDonough plant. The absorption benefit in last year's first quarter for producing more engines in the quarter year-over-year was 230 basis points.</p>
<p>And so again, we expect the margins to be improved in both businesses for the full fiscal year. I just caution you to go back and make sure you take a look at it quarter to quarter to take those production changes into account. I'd expect the production to be more compared to what it was in the preceding fiscal year, in fiscal year 2014 to be exact.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>2014. Right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh A. Borstein - Longbow Research LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>And that fiscal 2014, you're talking about the first quarter now, right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm talking about the full year when you think about when we would typically produce product for the season.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So, Josh, think about it this way. So if you think about how we would normally produce or where we have less production: Q1 we start to get heavier; Q2, Q3, it is the Engine business; and then obviously see where the season shakes out in Q4. You're going to see us obviously move out of Q1 into Q2, and depending on where we're at and how we see the season shaping up, we may even try to compress a little bit closer into Q3 because we have been able to do some pretty interesting things at our plants to produce closer to the season, similar to how the OEMs have done it as well.</p>
<p>So the caution we're trying to give you guys is don't look at last year and just say it's going to be the same. I think you've got to really make sure that as you contemplate 1Q, 2Q that it's going to be different, maybe not so much in Q2 but certainly 1Q. But I will tell you that we will try to produce closer to the season as we can, which means we may ramp later in Q2. We got to see how the rest of the season goes and then ultimately where inventory levels are and where we think our production levels need to be.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh A. Borstein - Longbow Research LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. That's helpful. Thank you for the color there. And then just related to that and in terms of the top line in the Products segment, given this SKU rationalization efforts you have going, should we modeling revenue growth in Products, or is most of the growth this year going to come from the Engine segment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>No. We're anticipating growth in both the Engines and the Products business. We're not going to give specific guidance for sales in each segment. We've given you our outlook for what we think the lawn and garden market may be for next year in the two largest markets that we have, which is North America and Europe. The acquisitions contributed about $60 million of growth in total in fiscal 2015. The other thing that we've already disclosed is that the Billy Goat acquisition is about a $30 million annual sales company. And so, we only owned it for one month of fiscal 2015, and so that certainly will be part of the growth heading into next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>And just to build on that, Josh, if you think about the Products side, yes, you're absolutely correct that the Snapper SKU rationalization will have a headwind, but we've seen tremendous growth in commercial cutting, commercial lawn and garden equipment, and we're projecting that into the future. That growth may be not as strong as it's been the last couple of years, but we do anticipate growth there. And that's a big place in which we're focusing our Products business.</p>
<p>So, the acquisitions, along with some of the growth in that commercial business, will more than offset the Snapper SKU rationalization that will be coming through.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh A. Borstein - Longbow Research LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And the growth that you've seen in commercial, is that a result of some of the increased placements you have? Or is that more just the macro environment getting better or both?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>There's two things that really play into it. One is just the market for that type of equipment continues to do very well. And as the U.S. economy continues to improve albeit at a pretty slow rate, people are willing to spend the money on commercial cutters to free up some time although it's not a huge shift, but it's certainly something that we think will continue as the economy goes well.</p>
<p>The other thing is that we've had some new product launches in that part of the business that have done very well. And so, it's really a combination of just overall market – where the market, we think the market's gone pretty well, as well as where we ultimately see our business from the new SKUs that we've come out with.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh A. Borstein - Longbow Research LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. And just one more from me. The large uptick that you guys saw in the smaller-sized engines, to what do you attribute this to? And what do you think that says about the consumer right now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm not sure I'd read too much into it, Josh, about what it says about the consumer, other than if you look at kind of where inventories were on a year-over-year basis. There was some heavier selling of rides in the past. And so, the walk market is kind of catching up, if you will, versus where it's been historically because, historically, that walk market has been relatively flat to down for several years and now we finally saw the uptick.</p>
<p>So, I think it's a combination of inventories that were in the channel as we exited last year, as well as, I think you're just seeing an improved, somewhat improved, I want to be cautious, a somewhat improved housing market on the lower end of the housing market where you would normally see walk behind mowers sell-through.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. One thing I'd add to that, Josh, is that keep in mind for the full year, it's not as much of a significant increase. And so what you're really seeing there is a shift in the timing. We mentioned that as we went throughout Q1 and Q2 with inventories being somewhat elevated in the United States. And so, I think the year from a total market perspective, played out how we would have thought. It was just that it ended up being a bit back loaded into our fourth quarter because of the inventories that were being lowered in the channel earlier in the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Josh A. Borstein - Longbow Research LLC</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. I appreciate all the color and good luck on the upcoming year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Josh.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tim Wojs from Baird. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Hey, guys. Good morning. Nice job.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Tim.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>I guess just going back to Q1, I just want to kind of make sure with the headwind from some of the snow thrower placements that you talked about, you got I think, actually, a pretty much bigger comparison in the first quarter of last year just due to some shipment kind of changes there. In Engines, I mean, can revenue be up in the first quarter? Just, absolutely, I mean how should we just think about the revenue number in Q1 in Engines?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I think it's possible that it's flat to down and...</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>...the reason for that is the comments that we made about some snow placement that obviously we know about at this point in time. As it happens in each year, this particular year, we're down a few SKUs in snow engine placement, so that will impact the first quarter, certainly. And then the other thing that's going to potentially impact the quarter is what happens with retail sell-through in the quarter that we're currently in.</p>
<p>So, it's been going relatively well, as Todd alluded to earlier in the call. Sell-through has been okay. And at this point, it's typically just a matter of timing as to when the reorders turn off from the retailers that are selling the equipment. But I think because of those reasons that it's feasible, that for the first quarter, Engines would be flat to down year-over-year in sales.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. No, that's helpful. Thanks. And I guess just on kind of what's happened in July and August here, I mean are you seeing the POS levels being pretty stable with the fiscal fourth quarter? And then how are the retailers restocking or reordering? Is it below POS? Are they kind of waning down inventories? Maybe just some color on that would be helpful on the retail side.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Typically – well, first, based on the information that we have, I would tell you that at the beginning of July, retail continued to be pretty good on a year-over-year basis. Since that point in time, it started to slow down in certain pockets.</p>
<p>And so, the retailers will typically, at this time of year, start to dial it back so that they're bleeding down their inventories. Their ultimate goal would be to not carry over a significant amount of lawn and garden inventory through the winter and into next spring. Certainly, all of them continue to focus on working capital, and put the requirements back on the OEMs and then back to us in our engine business to carry the inventory and make sure that we are there for them and we will continue to be.</p>
<p>So, I think that's a long way of telling you that they're starting to, in certain pockets, take that inventory down. And the last comment I'd make, Tim, is that when we really look at this year, it's pretty typical. It's more normal than what it certainly has been over the last three seasons, both in terms of the spring and the timing of ramping up with maybe the slight exception being the Northeast which held on to winter a bit longer. But otherwise, I think that as best as we can tell, it was a fairly normal year in terms of spring warm-up, summer sell-through, and now how the retailers appear to be looking at it for heading into fall.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Great. And then just we think about – just maybe this is a longer term question -- but when we think about just the SG&A levels within the business today versus maybe the last five years or six years, I mean is there a way for us to think about what the optimum level of SG&A is in the business for the revenue that we're generating today?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>The best way to think about it, Tim -- the problem is when you do acquisitions, right, ESG&A comes, you get an ESG&A load and oftentimes you can't completely synergize, if you will, your way out of an ESG&A increase. So you're going to see ESG&A go up, for example, year-on-year because we've got Billy Goat that is now rolling into a full year results as well as a bit more of Allmand. So, you look at that and that's difficult to completely offset obviously.</p>
<p>What we strive to do in the business as we achieve the organic growth is we strive to keep that ESG&A load level and we obviously look for ways to reduce it every day. But when you look at increasing the top line organically, we want to make sure we get that leverage flowing through to the operating income line.</p>
<p>So, it's hard to tell you – I'm not going to tell you that we target X percent because there's a lot of things that go into that. But I will tell you that on the organic side, the whole idea is to make sure that we're not growing ESG&A, but we are growing top line, we are growing gross margins and therefore you get leverage down to the operating income line.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Okay. Great. And then just the last question -- on commercial cutting in engines, I mean, it was down year-over-year. Was that something you anticipate? I mean, did that surprise you, or was that something that you guys had kind of fully factored into expectations for the fourth quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Let me clarify your question first. So, in terms of engines for commercial cutting, that actually grew for us on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>And with the product introductions that we've had over the last couple of years and some of the focus that that commercial sales team has had, they've been working very diligently on selling more engines into the commercial market and, as you can expect, has a longer sales lead time. And so, we hired some great people a couple of years ago and they've been opening a lot of doors for us and we've consequently been growing that business in excess of what the commercial market has been growing for our commercial engines.</p>
<p>The part that was down year-over-year, and it wasn't very significant, was the engines that – our larger engines that go on to consumer riding equipment. And I would tell you that that slightly did surprise us year-over-year, and the surprise was that there was perhaps just a little bit more inventory in the channel than what we had originally anticipated coming into the year. When I say a little bit, I really do mean a little. It was maybe 1% or 2% than what we thought. And so it's not huge, but that would be the only thing that maybe surprised us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tim R. Wojs - Robert W. Baird & Co., Inc. (Broker)</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, nice job on the year, and good luck next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Tim.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Sam Darkatsh from Raymond James. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua K. Wilson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>Morning. This is Josh filling in for Sam. Thanks for taking my questions, and congratulations on the quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua K. Wilson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>You talked about ending engine inventories of around $1.1 million. How did that compare with your plan?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>That was in line with our plan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua K. Wilson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>And what are your initial thoughts on production versus shipments in 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we don't forecast what the production and shipment numbers will be for fiscal 2016. I think, as we said, we'll have a continued focus on working capital efficiency across all of our working capital accounts.</p>
<p>I will tell you that we continue to believe that we have the most opportunity in inventories. We have a fair amount of work going on in order to make sure that our sales and operations planning process is what it should be. And so we have continued goals to take inventories down and that some of the improvement that you see what Todd was talking about in terms of the $20 million reduction in working capital year-over-year that we've targeted in fiscal 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>And Josh, remember, I mean, we obviously forecasted internally, but we don't – we really haven't disclosed it in the past which is why we give you guys what we did this last year historically and then talk about where the market is at and then you can make your own judgment where we try to give you some color as Dave just did on where we think our working capital is going.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua K. Wilson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>Very helpful. And switching to raw materials, are you looking to hedge or forward purchase any more or less maybe than what you did last year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we haven't changed how we think about our hedging program. We don't specifically disclose because of the sensitive nature of the pricing discussions exactly what we hedge and how much we hedge and when.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Todd J. Teske - Chairman, President & Chief Executive Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>You got to remember, Josh, that when we go out and we have the negotiations on product lineups and engine placement and everything else, our hedging program is designed to protect the plan. It's not designed to speculate or anything like that. It's designed to correct the plan. So we're not anticipating deviating from that at all.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>But maybe the last thing I'd add, Josh, is that if you look at where things like aluminum have been over the last two years, it's been a lot less volatile in terms of aluminum raw material cost and what it was back in the 2009 through 2012 or 2013 timeframe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua K. Wilson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>And lastly just to help sum things up on the 1Q commentary, I definitely appreciate the color on Engines and the snow impacts and margins, and then also the fact that retail seems to be doing okay. Summing that all together, do you think the first quarter EPS will be better or worse year-on-year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>We don't provide the quarterly EPS guidance, Josh. I think when you take into consideration the comments we've made on sales, it's implied that sales can actually be down year-over-year from a first quarter perspective, and that the lower production in the first quarter, in particular in the Engines business, will have the year-over-year impact of having lower margins in the Engine business. And so, we've been very transparent with the impact that each quarter has with respect to production activities and increases or decreases in production. So we'll leave it at that and we are not providing any further guidance on what quarterly EPS may be.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua K. Wilson - Raymond James & Associates, Inc.</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Good luck with the next quarter, and thanks again for the color.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And that looks like all the questions that we're going to be getting in the queue for today. So I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>David J. Rodgers - Senior Vice President and Chief Financial Officer</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, everyone, for joining the conference call today. Enjoy the rest of your summer. We'll look forward to talking with you again on October after the end of our first quarter. Have a great day.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program, and you may all disconnect the telephone lines at this time. Everyone, have a great day.</p>
