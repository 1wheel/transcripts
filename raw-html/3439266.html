<p>Good afternoon and welcome to Telkonet's Second Quarter Earnings Conference Call. As a reminder, today's conference is being recorded. Before I turn the call over to Jason Tienor, Telkonet's Chief Executive, I would like to read the following statement.</p>
<p>Certain statements included in this conference call may constitute forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. Such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties such as competitive factors, technological development, market demand and the Company’s ability to obtain new contracts and accurately estimate net revenues due to variability in size, scope, and duration of projects, and internal issues in the sponsoring client.</p>

Telkonet is under no obligation to update items discussed today to reflect subsequent developments.</p>
<p>Now I would like to turn the call over to Jason Tienor, Telkonet’s President and CEO to discuss the results. Mr. Tienor, you may begin.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, operator. And good afternoon everyone, and thank you for joining us. Today we reported record results on almost every major performance indicator from completing a single best revenue quarter in the Company’s history to reporting the second highest gross margin percentage at 60%, we’ve continued to demonstrate Telkonet’s potential for growth and profitability. In addition, EcoSmart sales grew 22% year-over-year, showing the continued potential and strength in innovative Internet of Things platform. While we continued to recognize the greatest strength of sales in the hospitality sector in the second quarter, we saw a record performance in our educational market with the best single quarter performance in the Company’s history and 67% growth over the same period prior year.</p>
<p>Much of this educational growth continues to benefit from the development of our channel strategy which also reported 64% growth over the prior year period. Our entry into the higher educational market exposes Telkonet to more than 4,700 schools within the U.S. With more than 20 million post-secondary students and over 5 billion square feet of floor space, the higher education sector in the United States spends an estimated $14 billion annually on energy costs. Thus, campus living has become a significant concentration for us and relationships such as that with Johnson Controls assist us in maximizing our growth in this market.</p>
<p>Q2’s solid performance is the result of the last few years’ focus on aligning our core strengths of networking, intelligent platforms, and smart devices to capture the significant opportunity in the developing smart grid and Internet of Things space. During this time, we’ve continued to create additional operational efficiencies and architect our organization to accelerate growth and innovation in our platform. Because of these investments, we’re seeing an increased momentum in our business, improvements in our operating results, and evidence that our strategies are working. As I mentioned, our results on both the combined and divisional basis were the best in our history and are setting Telkonet up for a terrific year ahead.</p>
<p>Looking at the year ahead, our priorities for fiscal 2015 continued to be maximizing our top line growth while maintaining profitability, continued expansion of our channel sales strategy, expanding our target markets into the fast growing international space, and positioning ourselves for the enormous growth of consumer markets. I’ll begin by reviewing how we’re performing against our first priority; maximize top line growth while maintaining profitability. Having demonstrated 84% sequential and 9% year-over-year revenue growth, we’ve shown through the second quarter performance that we’re able to rapidly ramp sales and deliver on our pipeline opportunity. Also while successfully ramping to record revenue and delivering a strong top line performance, we were able to report the best operating income and EBITDA in the Company’s history with each resulting in 100% and 79% year-over-year growth respectively while also resulting in record gross margin performance at 60%.</p>
<p>In terms of maintaining profitability, the second quarter’s performance has demonstrated Telkonet’s ability to efficiently deploy capital to meet our strategic growth initiatives and the successful seasonal ramp of our business overall. This attention to operations and understanding of our business, allows us to adjust to the macro trends of our target industries while appropriately forecasting inventory and SG&amp;A requirements. Moving to priority two, continued expansion of our channel sales strategy, the second quarter represented the second highest revenue driven through channel sales in the Company’s history reaching $1.9 million or 40% of total sales and representing 64% growth over prior-year period.</p>
<p>Our continued growth and success in this area are driven by a number of factors, some are discussed before including segmenting our sales team into direct and channel account managers to better service and educate our channel partners, executing on the dedicated marketing calendar to provide news updates, webinars, partner training and certification meetings and more, and updated an improved educational portable for our partners offering training and continuous information sharing and education, invitations to and presentations at our yearly sales submit which recently took place in Milwaukee in July, dedicated personal time with our sales representatives and project development engineers to assist in closing sales opportunities.</p>
<p>A newly renovated product showcase in our Waukesha, Wisconsin headquarters to provide access to our partners and their customers in a full deployment environment. And lastly, shared marketing and trade representation to assist in market penetration and education. As you may have seen through some of the recent press, our channel focus and efforts are paying off as we continue to secure substantial channel agreements with influential partners in our industries. The publicized EcoSmart supply agreements filed earlier this year provides a strategic relationship with one of the largest HVAC providers in the hospitality space. Having combined revenue from sourced or unitary products or approximately $500 million and with the hospitality space purchasing roughly 400,000 units per year from a handful of vendors, our relationship with Trane provides an enormous opportunity for growth.</p>
<p>And since energy is the second highest operating cost component in the lodging industry, and 50% to 80% of these costs are related to HVAC system operation, our EcoSmart platform has demonstrated itself invaluable to Trane’s customers as well. In total, Trane employees more than 29,000 people at 104 manufacturing locations in 28 countries and has annual sales of more than $8 billion. We’re excited to continue to grow this mutually beneficially relationship and share future successes with you. Even more recently, you may have seen Samsung’s partnership announcement with Telkonet, this agreement has been long awaited since our development work with Samsung has taken well over a year. This relationship has two significant components, one a technology partner and the other a platform facilitator. With the release of Samsung’s HMS platform for hospitality, Telkonet is the only energy management platform integrated in North America through extensive product development completed alongside Samsung over the last year and half.</p>
<p>This means that we’ll have EcoSmart components deployed within the HMS platform for the only completely integrated entertainment and controls platform available in the hospitality market today. Secondly, Samsung chose Telkonet due to our national field service team, in-house project management, provisioning and deployment resources and our 24/7 support and monitoring center to the master solutions agent handling all deployments in North America as well. This not only means additional services revenue tied to [Technical Difficulty] deployment but also ongoing recurring revenue tied to licensing and support of the Samsung HSM and EcoCentral platforms. As Samsung is targeting to grow up 10,000 rooms annually for the HMS platform, we are very excited with the possibilities provided by this relationship.</p>
<p>Moving to the third priority for 2015, expansion globally and into consumer markets, these areas are a focus for Telkonet because of the size of both of these new markets are substantial. Starting with the global market, one of the fastest growing areas for hospitality and specifically for intelligent controls in hospitality is outside of the United States. Well, there are more than 50,000 hotels in the U.S. alone offering 5 million rooms; there are 187,000 hotels worldwide with 17.5 million rooms which more than triples our total addressable market or TAM. This is why we’re continuing the development of our worldwide sales channel to reach this untapped global market for growth. Successful international expansions into Brazil for example come as a result of strategic relationship with channel partners like Evolutix.</p>
<p>Together, we’ve been collaborating on the sale and installation of EcoSmart energy management technology in a number of hotel and hospitality properties including the marquee Hilton Barra project in Rio de Janeiro. We’re highly focused on growing these international channel relationships to monetize the global demand for our solutions and explosion of interest in the Internet of Things and intelligent automation. In addition to working with channel partners, we are also continuing to work directly with hospitality franchisors to reach and educate this audience. Success to date includes the establishment of relationships with franchisors such as Marriott and Starwood. We also recently signed an agreement with Hilton Hotels which operates a franchise of more than 4,100 hotels and 680,000 rooms across 91 countries, and we’re now an improved supplier for all Hilton branded properties.</p>
<p>These relationships are invaluable for putting us in front of qualified customers and educating hospitality owners. As it relates to expanding into the consumer market, continued product development and new product releases are essential to executing on this priority. This positions us for growth in our current domestic and growing international markets as well. New project releases in the quarter include the recent release of our EcoTouch wireless touch screen thermostat. This generated an enormous amount of interest at the recent HITEC hospitality industry trade show to the point that it was called the best device seen on the floor as well as highlighted in several post show editorials. With the continued development of our EcoSmart suite of products, our next releases are a next generation EcoSense wireless sensor, EcoContact wireless door and window contact, and finally and possibly most important our EcoConnect wireless gateway, which positions us well for the small retail and consumer markets.</p>
<p>In addition, our customer focus EcoMobile web application allowing device control from a user’s own mobile device definitely sets us apart from any other commercial IOT platform available to our target markets. These continued product and platform developments are not only extending our lead in innovation but also enabling us to fulfill demand for our broader market. Existing opportunities through partner relationships continue to pull our products to our development roadmap and enable us to meet the needs of our customer while maximizing the strength of our portfolio. Evidently, we’ve continued the successful execution of our strategy for 2015 with profitable top line growth, expansion in our partner channels and finally expansion of our target market into the rapidly growing international space and forthcoming consumer markets. Our current results and outlook point to a possible growth year for Telkonet and our current strategy and pipeline has generated enormous opportunity for the company moving forward.</p>
<p>One last item that should be mentioned is the completion of the annual shareholder meeting and the vote of approval of a potential reverse split of Telkonet stock. The vote was overwhelmingly passed and provides the Company the opportunity to move forward should the board choose to do so under the appropriate conditions. We truly appreciate everyone’s participation in the proxy and approval.</p>
<p>Now, I’d like to hand the call over to our CFO, Gene Mushrush for a review of the second quarter financials. Gene?</p>
<p><strong>Gene Mushrush</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Jason. Ladies and gentlemen good afternoon and thank you for joining us. Today I will be summarizing our 2015 second quarter and year-to-date financial results. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015, Telkonet reported record revenues of $4.8 million, a 9% increase compared to $4.4 million for the same period prior year. Largely behind the 19% growth in Eco store activity, non-recurring revenues reached $3.7 million, a 9% increase compared to $3.4 million in the prior year period.</p>
<p>During the quarter, we began and/or completed a number of EcoSmart hospitality projects in Central and South America, a geographical focus for us since customers can maximize their return on investment due to climate and corresponding energy costs.</p>
<p>Recurring revenues consisting primarily of EcoCare and EcoStream support services grew 9% compared to the same period prior year while remaining at 21% of total revenues for the quarter. Gross profits for the quarter were $2.8 million, up 34% from $2.1 million last year. Gross margins were 60%, up 11% when compared to the same period prior year. In addition to increased revenues, lower support, inventory and installation costs assisted with the gross profit improvement.</p>
<p>Operating expenses for the quarter were $2.2 million compared to $1.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increases were attributable to a non-recurring accrual release, sales and marketing efforts, human capital investments and expenses related to the product launch of the EcoTouch Thermostat.</p>
<p>We recorded both operating and net incomes of approximately $590,000 and $525,000 respectively for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared to operating and net incomes of approximately $280,000 and $220,000 respectively at June 30, 2014.</p>
<p>Adjusted earnings, before interest, taxes, depreciation and amortization or EBITDA, a non-GAAP measure improved to approximately $660,000 for the quarter ended June 30 compared to approximately $350,000 for the same period prior year. Total year-to-date revenues of $7.3 million represented a 5% increase compared to prior year. Similar to the aforementioned quarterly summary, EcoSmart revenues were the primary driver of these results. Recurring revenues accounted for approximately 28% of total revenues consistent with last year. EcoCare introduced in the latter half of 2013 continues to gain traction amongst our customers delivering approximately 225% growth year-over-year.</p>
<p>Gross profits for the year were $4.1 million, up 30% from $3.1 million last year. Gross margins were 56%, up 11% when compared to last year. In addition to the increased revenues, lower support, inventory and outside service costs assisted with the gross profit improvement.</p>
<p>Year-to-date operating expenses were $4.2 million compared to $3.6 million for the same period in 2014. Increases were attributable to non-recurring accrual release of the company expenses, sales and marketing efforts, human capital investments and expenses related to the product launch of the EcoTouch Thermostat.</p>
<p>We recorded both year-to-date operating and net losses of approximately $80,000 and $220,000 respectively compared to operating and net losses of approximately $440,000 and $560,000 respectively at June 30, 2014. Year-to-date EBITDA was approximately $60,000 compared to a negative $295,000 for the same period prior year.</p>
<p>We reported approximately $860,000 in cash and equivalents at June 30, 2015 compared to $1.1 million at this time last year; combining a light first quarter, a back-loaded second quarter and increased operating expenses, this decrease is reasonable. Cash used in operations during the first six months was approximately $510,000 compared to cash provided by operations of approximately $460,000 in the prior year period.</p>
<p>The significant rise in AR is purely timing related and given that our DSO was averaging 35 days, there is no cause for concern. We reported a working capital deficit measured as current assets plus current liabilities of approximately $485,000 at June 30, 2015, an improvement of approximately $640,000 when compared to a deficit of $1.1 million over the same six-month period last year.</p>
<p>In mid-November 2009, the company executed a Series A preferred stock transaction. If certain criteria existed as defined per the agreement, the holders have the option beginning of the fifth anniversary date and continuing for a period of 180 days thereafter to request in writing a redemption of all outstanding Series A shares. In turn, the company was then required to pay the holders $5,000 per share, plus any accrued, but unpaid dividends.</p>
<p>The redemption option expired in mid-May 2015 with no request for such redemption. As a result, $1.3 million was reclassified from temporary equity, which was defined as redeemable preferred stock to permanent equity in the company’s condensed consolidated balance sheet at June 30, 2015. The company will continue to accrue dividends at a rate of 8% until either the company declares and pays a dividend or the holder converts their preferred stock to common.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the second quarter was one for the record books as we established records in both revenues and EBITDA. Recalling our first quarter, it was a substantial rebound, the one that was anticipated when considering backlog and seasonal tailwinds. With a well-received showing at this year’s HiTec Show, the Samsung entering relationships and the launch of the EcoTouch Thermostat, we are positioned for short and long-term success.</p>
<p>Once again, thank you for your interest, and to our shareholders specifically, thank you for your continued support. I will now turn the call back to Telkonet's President and Chief Executive Officer, Jason Tienor.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Gene. With that I'd like to hand the call over to our operator to answer any questions that you may have. Operator?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Mark Sullivan of Mount Vernon Associates. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, Jason. How are you?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>I am doing well, Mark, good afternoon to you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>What would be the conditions for a potential stock split, reverse split?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>In the conversations that the Board has had thus far, what we are looking to do is, demonstrating the performance of the company would justify not just the stock split, but a potential uplifting on two or large restraints. So putting one good quarter behind us here in Q2 was great, but we are really looking forward to executing as well on the third and even potentially the fourth and then the Board would make a determination at that time, so it would be the appropriate time to do so.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>Would you say this quarter marks a reversal in your revenue growth, you’ve had a contraction of your revenue growth year-over-year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t necessarily say that we’ve had contraction in revenue growth because we have been growing year-over-year while on minimum -</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>No, your growth rate that was being contracting.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I would definitely say that we are seeing much greater interest and evolution within the intelligent automation space and specifically within the target markets that we work within. Also the fact that our solution has not only evolved and developed itself, but it’s becoming, it’s seeing much greater acceptance within these markets and we are building longer and stronger relationships with current customers. So rather than having to work towards individual projects one at a time, we are starting to mark a lot of recurring business through existing customers and existing relationships. So I definitely would say so.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>Okay. I mean, the business has kind of been changing over the years, I understand that from you were growing I guess 2012 over 2011, you revenue growth was 14%, 2013 over 2012 was 9%, 2014 over 2013 was 6% and now it’s kind of as your business mix was starting to change, I am just trying to identify if we are seeing that reversal if maybe we can start to expect a revenue expansion growth rate going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>That would be the actual case, Mark specifically because as we discussed, EcoSmart is really where the growth of our business is directed and by the rapid ramping of the market for intelligent technology and intelligent automation solutions is allowing us to be received more quickly to shrink down our sales cycle and thus obviously increase revenue, both growth and pace of growth. So I would expect that, not only will we see the growth pace increasing, but we are going to be able to see a dramatic change in it over the next few years, just because we’ve kind of moved past the educational cycle of selling our products to - we longer have to educate the audience, they already understand it, now, we are certainly moving towards the winning over the loyalties of the customer base.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>Do you see - your quarters can be very lumpy that has the seasonality, do you think that will start to smooth out going forward? Do you see any potential for - I mean, that Q1, it just is such a land mine sometimes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>I hate to say, Mark, because it’s very difficult for us to address Q1 and the markets that we service. They are very seasonal and Q1 is difficult for us to work the counter [ph], but what we are doing is we are reaching towards trends that allow us to address them. The international growth is one big area here that would allow us to address the first quarter’s lumpiness. Another area is by building out our channel sales, we are not as heavily dependent on our own direct sales efforts and it allows us to more straight-line the activity throughout the year.</p>
<p>At a lower revenue number where we are right now, you tend to find a lot more lumpiness, but as we continue to grow increasing topline revenue, I believe that we are going to be able to counter that as well just because of the increased margin of business and the ability to - what’s the word I want to - the ability to straight-line the completion of our projects more into the first quarter. A lot of our first quarter business is not the business that starts in the first quarter, it’s business that starts in the fourth quarter and -</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks, Jason.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>You are welcome. Have a great afternoon.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Sullivan</strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Jeremy Hellman of Avenue T Fund. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Hellman</strong></p>
<p>Hi, good afternoon, guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, Jeremy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Hellman</strong></p>
<p>I wanted to dig into the sales theme a little bit further here and you alluded to one part of my question which was going to be whether or not the sales cycle was contracting or lengthening potentially as a function of larger contracts. So some more color on that would be great. And also wanted to get a better sense of - as you are seeing revenues push upward, which is great, congrats on that. Is that primarily a function of your own direct sales efforts or is that coming more out of your channel partners like the ESCOs?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. I am going to answer the later question first. I believe that a lot - a large portion of our increased revenue is coming directly through our channel sales. As I mentioned, we saw a 64% increase year-over-year in the amount of sales closed through our channel partners. And that really is the model for our business moving forward, Jeremy, as we are trying to move away from direct sales and rely more heavily on channel partners. What it does for us it removes the bottleneck and our ability to increase or ramp our growth. With us not having to reach out to every customer, us not having to deploy every opportunity, we now have the ability to reach upon a larger audience and do so consecutively whereas before it just took a lot longer for us as our own sales entity.</p>
<p>That being said, while we concentrated on channel partners and while we see the largest growth through our channel partners, it also place into the first question you had which was sales cycle and the period to close. Direct sales have been shrinking and are easier to move towards completion and there is fewer moving parts. The larger problem and again, in addition to direct sales, hospitality sales are shrinking from a perspective of sales cycle. The larger problem is the area where you don’t see the sales cycle shrinking is largely through channel sales and large ESCO opportunities, because there are so many moving parts, because there are dramatically different agreements in place.</p>
<p>Usually performance contracts written by the ESCO that require a number of professional components such as bonding et cetera that just takes time to put in place. So it’s a little bit more difficult to shrink the sales cycle in that area of our business, but we consistently attempt to do so and we’ve put process in place to help us contract the sales cycle, but I don’t think you are going to see a dramatic change in that time frame overall. And unfortunately, that is the larger environmental sale. The average size on ESCO project or a channel sales opportunity is far larger than our direct sales opportunity. So it is a little bit skewed, but it’s definitely drawn on the middle between the sales cycle of channel partners and the sales cycle for our direct sales.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Hellman</strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks for that perspective. Kind of digging into the ESCO and channel partner aspect of things on a little bit further, I am trying to think of a best way to pose the question. Are you seeing any change in the dynamic whereby you are increasingly expecting especially if on an exclusive basis with any of these partners such that if you know [indiscernible], for example, if they were to go win, you will know that they are a bidding on a particular project, you know that if they get it, you are expecting from the get go. Are you seeing any change in that kind of dynamic?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. So that’s one area that we’ve put a lot of effort through our sales group to build out and that is our ability to reach towards the customer opportunities earlier in their deployment cycle. Very often, if we are first signing out a lot of project after the project is already broken ground or after they are already deploying construction materials to the projects, it’s too far gone and it’s very difficult to enter into the sales cycle at that phase. So what we have doing is working directly with engineering, architecture firms, design firms, ownership groups, and forging relationships whereby when they initially get the designs for a contemplated property, not even necessarily a planned property, but for a contemplated property, they are writing directly into the building specification. EcoSmart is the product line, EthoStream is the product line and that’s being sent down to the developer or the construction company.</p>
<p>So we find ourselves receiving more and more RFPs or requests that have us drawn directly into the project. And one big area for that is the fact that since we are already in the project, we will receive a number of different requests from different electrical firms or engineering firms that have to provide numbers for the bid for the project. And what it is doing is now since we received those requests in order to assist them and providing a proposal we can now forge new relationships with these new firms, so it might be the first time that we’ve met with them as well. So we are building our own channel simply through having reached into the customer audience earlier in the sales cycle.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Hellman</strong></p>
<p>Okay, that’s great stuff. One last one and then I will hop back into the queue. Do you have any ability to kind of gauge what your market share is when you think about, I mean this is kind of there is a lot of tentacles to the octopus there, but do you have any sense of what your market share is or are you gaining - it sounds like you might be gaining some share, but can you quantify that, any short of range or any kind of feedback would be great there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I know, I understand your question, Jeremy. That’s a very difficult one to answer. We can kind of spit numbers at the wall, but I don’t feel comfortable in giving any number at this time. We don’t have enough consensus on the market on what our growth rate within the available market. And we see a lot more studies coming out to-date that actually have these numbers. So we are doing a lot more research or to try to quantify this and we hope to share this with you in the future.</p>
<p>The other part of your question is our potential, our ownership over the market. To-date, we can tell that we are one of the fastest, if not the fastest firm within the occupational - not occupational, within the occupancy energy management space within hospitality which is the largest of the target markets that we service with the fastest growing and the largest within the educational space. The other target markets that we focus we don’t have very solid understanding of it in order to provide that same type of statement. But the one thing is that we know our largest competitor, it’s a company name INNCOM that was acquired by Honeywell a couple of years back.</p>
<p>We’ve been taking a significant amount of business away from INNCOM and from customers that they’ve typically serviced in the past, but we also find that they are seeing a significant growth rate internationally as well which is why we have sort of taken the ground and this is one of the key areas where you are going to see a lot of our efforts moving forward. Not only is it the fastest growing market for hospitality, but it also is one of the fastest growing markets for intelligent automation within hospitality. So we need to put a lot more effort and a lot more resources towards growing in that space, so that we can take advantage of the significant market opportunity available to us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Hellman</strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks, Jason. Keep up the good work.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from Mike Breard of Hodges Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Breard</strong></p>
<p>Yes, congratulations on the good quarter. I just wanted to ask you partnership - your partnership with Samsung and trying and coming to both sides, how many more channel partners can you - given that you ask without overlap. I know you’ve probably got a lot of opportunity overseas, but have you pretty fielded the US market with your channels?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>That’s a great question, but it has a number of different pieces to it and understanding of the market that these partners service and how they reach out to their audience and what they are selling to their audience is key. Just because Samsung may be able to sell to everybody within hospitality space doesn’t necessary mean that they are going to be selling this particular platform or the HMS to all of these hospitality customers. They may not have the best resources to do it or they may not cover specific regions very well. So having overlap is of interest to us. We need to make sure that we are not avoiding coverage in the specific area because we believe that there is a property that already covers it when they actually do not.</p>
<p>Another thing is when you are reaching out into hospitality, there are a number of different decision makers that participate in a new build property or renovation property, everybody from the architect and engineer to the construction manager to the electrical engineers et cetera are down the line. You actually want to have relationships with all of these groups that they are comfortable not just with our product and our technology, but are knowledgeable. So that when they run into one project hopefully that they participate and putting us into a future project well. So we want to have as much overlap as we can without creating channel conflict, but we also deal with channel conflicts very well. We work with our partners on a daily basis making sure that there isn’t any contention among them and I can tell you, Mike, that if that’s the one problem that I have, I welcome it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Breard</strong></p>
<p>Okay, are you seeing any more competition in your market space?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>We are seeing new entrants into the market space that target markets that we deal with especially because of how we go to market. Many of our competitors are still stuck in the legacy world of energy management or specific thermostatic controls and that is not what Telkonet and EcoSmart platform are built as. EcoSmart is truly an intelligent automation platform comprised of many parts from light switches to wall outlets to thermostats to your sensors. All these things work together with a software platform called EcoCentral. We provided the 24/7 services [indiscernible] et cetera through our EcoCare model as well as offering our EcoMobile applications to the rest of our customers and their end users. This whole platform put together is what EcoSmart itself is and we do not have a competitor in that model today and that’s how we separate ourselves from the competition out there and that’s how we market ourselves to our customers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Breard</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Just one last question. At the HITEC Convention this year, how did it compare with pervious conventions? Are more and more people aware of what you do? It sounds like they are and it just seems to me it’s a lot easier to make the 15<sup>th</sup> sale than the first sale and it looks like you could build a quite bit of momentum going into 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, you are absolutely right about that and I can tell you that the HITEC Convention this year was the best ever for us. In fact we had to take a number of additional resources to the show compared to past years because of the level of interest. Myself and one other of our executives actually had to spend the entirety of the convention in the Samsung booth talking to Samsung’s customers and out potential future customers about HMS and demoing the platform as well. So we had an enormous amount of interest.</p>
<p>We met with a large number of customers that we had never spoken with before or customers that we had a tough time breaking into that really felt not just the relationship that we have with Samsung and the Smart Hospitality Room deployment exceptional, but also the release of our EcoTouch product and truly moved ourselves basically upper ring in the level of hospitality audience that we entertain to because of the new release product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Breard</strong></p>
<p>Okay. I suppose you probably may not want to make an estimate of revenues for the second half of the year or revenues next year, but I thought I’d ask anyway.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>No problem. I have no problem with you asking, but no, we’re not ready at this time to be forecasting to the remainder of the year. This isn’t a constant topic of our board discussions as to when we’re going to make that next step to begin forecasting, but we have decided that through the remainder of 2015, we will not be doing so.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Ed Stein, a private investor. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Hi, Jason. Congratulations on a great quarter. You know it wouldn’t be an earnings call if I didn’t ask one or two questions. First one is, from what I got doing from the announcement, it appeared that with trained, you have shown them how to do a lot of the installs without having a lot of Telkonet personnel involved, whereas with Samsung, I get the feeling they’re going to need you more. Is that accurate?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>That is accurate. It’s actually accurate by design. The trade relationship is more about our sales and marketing relationship whereby we’ve struck a master agreement with them, where they’re going to be deploying our solutions alongside their existing HVAC equipment and their entire national sales force will be educated on our product, so that when they’re bidding on projects, they can bid our intelligent platform alongside of the existing HVAC hardware that they’re proposing.</p>
<p>With Samsung on the other hand, our agreement with them is two-fold. It’s first that we have integrated our technology in to their technology so that you can turn off lights, turn off our outlets, turn up and down our thermostats directly from the remote and also on screen on their televisions within the room. So that is a technology integration that we’ve completed with them.</p>
<p>The second part of that relationship is one of a services partner. So in the sales, when we sell an HMS platform or when they sell an HMS platform, we will actually be doing the deployment of that platform. So everything from procuring the hardware, building out the platform, installing in to the customer premise and providing the aftermarket support after the installation is completed will be done by Telkonet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Wow, and you’ll be able to keep up with it as they have a lot of sales?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>As I said before, that’s a great problem to have.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Okay. One other one. I hope for my fellow investors that none is as technologically challenged as I am, but could you give an explanation. I could tell from the announcements at high techs and the reactions to them that you’ve gone a step beyond what existed before. Can you explain what it is, what are the aspects of our new platform that are superior to what’s on the market today and what the additional use is that besides operating and monitoring the smart thermostat, what else they could be used for?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. I’m going to try to keep it short and if anybody wants additional detail, I’m more than happy to have a separate call, so please reach out to either our IR line or myself. But basically as I mentioned before, EcoSmart is made up of four distinct legs or four pillars. Those pillars are hardware, software, services and mobile applications.</p>
<p>So if we start with hardware, the EcoSmart suite of products is comprised of a number of different models of thermostats, both wired and wireless that allow us to do a number of things that other competitive products can’t, in fact our newest released thermostat, the EcoTouch thermostat is an all-touch capacitive thermostat, provides feedbacks or when the screen is pressed, you actually receive the small vibration knowing that you’re pressing it, utilize a number of new technologies that nobody else has deployed in this industry such as light monitoring and dimming of the screen in order to both save battery life and not to disrupt the user in a room by having a bright light in the middle of the night being displayed from a doorstep as well as a sensing feature so that they thermostat stays dim up until somebody approaches it and as you approach, it senses the user approaching and lightens the screen, so that you are able to see it and make changes to it. These are features and innovations that we’ve created that nobody else in the market has today.</p>
<p>In addition to the thermostats, we’ve also released ZigBee light switches and wall outlets that are controlled both by our software, by third party triggers, by other devices are integrated to other platforms such as control four and now Samsung so that based on the ability to use some other device or the ability to monitor an environment if you walk off the door, we’re able to cut the energy consumption of every single thing in the room, simply by turning off all the power to the outlets, to the light switches, to the HVAC equipment et cetera.</p>
<p>We also provide third party sensors such as door and window censors, remote occupancy sensors, ZigBee related equipment like gateways and ZigBee to Ethernet converters that allow us to network this entire platform, utilizing networks like our EthoStream network, that’s all comprised within our EcoSmart suite of products.</p>
<p>The second pillar is EcoCentral, which is a cloud based software service that allows not just our monitoring center and support center, but also the customers themselves to, from one convenient location, monitor all one or just part of any individual property to deploy reports on how the property is performing, how much money it’s saving, what mechanicals need are repair and maintenance.</p>
<p>We, also within that EcoCentral cloud based platform, deploy a series of reports called our Virtual Engineer that basically are reports that alert the customer when specific maintenance is required. So that rather than having to search through the platform or the property themselves and determine what is needed to be done, we alert them prior to maintenance needing to be required, so that they can send out engineering without having to take rooms out of service and therefore saving them more money and extending the benefits.</p>
<p>Third is EcoCare, which is our 24x7 service. We provide a monitoring center right here in Milwaukee, Wisconsin that monitors all of the outstanding equipment within our customer sites from both the network side as well as the mechanical side, alerts customers to when there are difficulties, when there are problems, when there are break/fixes or defects, I mean works with the customer in order to resolve those issues, it also provides services to make those fixes as well as extended warranty on our products and the access to the EcoCentral platform itself.</p>
<p>The fourth pillar is EcoMobile. EcoMobile are a series of native applications for both iOS and Android. One that is written specifically for our partners that allow them to deploy our solutions in a very rapid and efficient manner through utilizing the phone, its camera, and its data connection. They are able to upload information directly from scanning the bar code on the device prior to installation to taking pictures of where they are installed and uploading them directly in to our EcoCentral platform.</p>
<p>The second application is direct to our customers, allowing their engineers or housekeeping staff in order to using their own devices, see the occupancy of guest rooms, see where guest rooms need maintenance, see levels of savings and reporting services directly from their own handheld using the mobile application and the final application was an EcoMobile that we are working on and look to be releasing soon is a customer facing application that will allow our hotel guests use of their own device with our application to control all of the controls within a hospitality room from the thermostat to the wall outlet to the light switch and that’s a new application for every hotel, but the same application will be able to be used through any hotel where our products are deployed.</p>
<p>All four of those legs of the EcoSmart platform come together to create efficiencies such as reducing energy costs, reducing labor costs, reducing maintenance costs, increasing comfort for the hotel here as well as their guests, increasing amounts of the operation of a building and the analytics that are provided through it and increasing the productivity of staff as well.</p>
<p>And I know it’s a large explanation.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Wow, I’m sorry I missed a part of that. Could you repeat that? Just quick follow up. You said there were some very good reviews, did many of the people reviewing it seem to catch on to just - I mean I’m sure they can’t catch on to all of those advantages, but did you seek an appreciation of what breakthrough you’ve got there. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Well, most of the reviews were specifically around the EcoTouch product and its release or HMS, the platform that we’ve released with Samsung. So educating our audience on the full capacity and capabilities of EcoSmart itself is still an effort of our sales team and one that’s taken the heart and they’re very good at.</p>
<p>Things like high tech allow us the opportunity to get in front of a much larger audience or to share that history. So it’s very productive in that manner, very often we saw customers that are simply coming to us for intelligent thermostats or energy management, and through that conversation, we’re able to share with them our installed benefits of our overall platform a little bit better, but with each customer that we educate on this, the larger our audience becomes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Well and one last question, if somebody wants a Samsung system in their hotels, do they have to buy all new televisions from Samsung so they work or can they buy other things from Samsung or use parts of the system without having the whole integrated system using their TVs?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jason Tienor</strong></p>
<p>Yeah. So that is one catch. There are only specific models that support the HMS platform. They have to have the ability to speak through ZigBee using the equipment provided that integrates with our software and our hardware.</p>
<p>That being said, they have to be smart televisions, in hospitality, there are specific hospitality model numbers for Samsung as well. Hospitality model numbers, smart TVs and also they are very limited right now to the sizes of those models as well, but as the platform grows, they are continuously working to evolve and extended the HMS platform to other television sets and releasing new television sets that would be capable of operating it as well.</p>
<p>So it continues to grow, this is just the first release and high tech was just the first time people were able to be with and use it and as I said, we just had an enormous response to it, gave us a lot of great feedback from customers and what their ongoing interests were moving forward and we continued to do continuous development with them on an ongoing basis to continue to evolve the HMS platform.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Congratulations. It’s an incredible accomplishment. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>There are no further questions at this time. So I would like to turn the floor back over to Mr. Jason Tienor for closing comments.</p>
