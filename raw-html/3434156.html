<p><strong>Daureen Green</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, operator, and good day, everybody. I would like to welcome all of you to EZchip’s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. With us on the line today are Mr. Eli Fruchter, CEO; and Mr. Dror Israel, CFO.</p>
<p>Before we begin, I would like to point out that during this call, certain non-GAAP financial measures will be discussed. These non-GAAP measures are used by management to make strategic decisions and forecast future results, and the company believes that these figures provide a better method of evaluating the company’s current performance. A full reconciliation of the company’s non-GAAP financial measures to GAAP financial measures is included in the earnings release.</p>
<p>I will now hand the call over to EZchip’s CEO, Eli Fruchter. Eli?</p>
<p><strong>Eli Fruchter</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Daureen. Good day everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. First, I would like to discuss our main achievements during the second quarter being one, our strong financial results; two, our Tier-1 NPS design wins; three, the improved customer diversification; and four, the renewed partnership with Marvell.</p>
<p>One, strong financial results: Overall, we are very pleased with our reported second quarter results. Revenues increased 28% year-over-year and 5% sequentially during the second quarter of 2015 to $28.3 million, above the mid-point of our prior guidance range of $27.5 million to $28.5 million.</p>
<p>Gross margin of 76.7% in the second quarter was higher than anticipated driven mainly by favorable mix and combined with lower than expected OpEx spending drove robust second quarter non-GAAP earnings per share of $0.34. Revenues for the first half of 2015 reached $55.2 million, a 30% year-over-year growth compared to $42.4 million during the first half of 2014.</p>
<p>Successful integration of Tilera contributed to top-line growth while achieving better than expected cost synergies, reducing expected 2015 annual OpEx to $48 million from the $55 million estimated at the beginning of the year and the $52 million estimated last quarter.</p>
<p>Two, Tier-1 NPS design wins: NPS remains on track to tape-out this month with expectations for customer samples in the fourth quarter of 2015. Interest in NPS remains elevated, and we are very pleased to report five Tier-1 design wins in our new target markets for white boxes and data centers as well as in our traditional carrier router markets, to commence following sample availability. Three of these reported design wins are in our new target markets, a white box with a Tier-1 carrier; a white box with a hyper-scale data center operator; and a third win with a Tier-1 data center switch vendor. Within our core networking end market, we already reported a win with ZTE and we now have another Tier-1 switch/router vendor, which brings the total to five Tier-1 wins.</p>
<p>We believe it is important for investors to note that the NPS enables EZchip to capture significantly more customers with more use cases than previously achieved with the NP-4 or NP-5 products. We are now targeting both the carrier and data center markets, where we sell to networking equipment vendors that serve these markets, and we are also pursuing the white box model in which we sell directly to the carrier and data center operators that utilize the white box model. The reported design wins of Tier-1 customers demonstrates all these types of opportunities, carriers and data centers served through equipment vendors and white boxes.</p>
<p>Three, improved customer diversification: During the first half of 2015, we recorded strong growth within the others customers segment which includes all customers other than Cisco and ZTE. For this others category, we saw the first half of 2015 revenues up more than 90% versus the first half of 2014, suggesting a broader customer base and revenue diversification which lessens the company’s dependence on the Cisco ASR9K platform. Total sales to Cisco including Cisco’s other platforms served by our network processors and multicore processors represent 35% of our sales, but roughly 25% is attributed to the ASR9K. While we expect continued revenue growth from this platform, we believe prior investor expectations for 35% to 40% of our revenues to be at risk due to the decision by Cisco for next generation line cards in its ASR9K platform, may be overstated.</p>
<p>We believe there is ample time to develop our NPS-1000, which offers a 2.5x performance increase over the current NPS-400 offering, and to change their decision on future line cards for their edge routing platform in 2018. Cisco will continue to be a successful and growing customer for years to come with ASR9K being the main platform.</p>
<p>Fourth, renewed partnership with Marvell: We believe our market leading position in merchant NPUs saw further gains due to changes in the competitive landscape. Marvell Semiconductor, EZchip’s ASIC partner for Cisco for the NP-3, NP-4 and NP-5 product lines, has recently reorganized its networking business and has chosen to partner with EZchip for merchant NPU design needs and recommend EZchip’s NPUs within Marvell’s current and future networking customers. This expanded relationship will provide Marvell’s networking customers the best-in-breed merchant NPU product portfolio, and can open up new revenue opportunities for EZchip. We believe the expanded partnership with Marvell provides further validation of EZchip’s market leading merchant NPU portfolio. With the joint partnership between Marvell and EZchip, we believe there are no remaining high-speed merchant NPU competitors.</p>
<p>Other companies that have previously made public statements suggesting a more meaningful entrance into the merchant NPU market, as of today to the best of our knowledge, have no product roadmap for a next generation merchant NPU product. Given recent developments within Marvell, and no future high-end NPU-based roadmap within other companies, we believe EZchip is the only remaining high-speed merchant NPU company actively developing new products to serve the market. It is important to note that NPS is targeting a much broader market than NPUs have traditionally been targeting owing to its applicability to data centers and cloud networks. Other merchant NPU vendors saw limited success in the traditional NPU market and now that there are expansion opportunities to other markets their architecture is lacking functionality and flexibility, specifically C programmability, Layer 4-7 processing and support of a standard operating system.</p>
<p>These NPS features are a must have for a wide range of products and applications beyond switches and routers, including network virtualization, SDN, NFV, security, network monitoring, load balancing and more. This is demonstrated through the reported NPS design wins.</p>
<p>Looking at our legacy products, late last year we announced the production of NP-5 which boosts design wins in our customers’ leading platforms as well as with new customers. It is important to remind investors that substantially all NP-4 customers adopted the NP-5, and we continue to gain new design wins with NP-5 and expect that NP-5 will continue to generate new opportunities in 2015 and beyond. The NP-5 provides unprecedented integration and programmability which enables our customers to build leading routers and switches for carrier networks as well as data center appliances, especially customer platforms which require exceptional port density and high-level functionality. We also see new design win opportunities for our multicore TILE-Gx products, marked by the growing need of offloading networking functions to high performance and programmable silicon in data center networking appliances and servers.</p>
<p>Looking at our ongoing multicore development: The second quarter of 2015 our multi-core revenues continued to be comprised primarily of the TILE-Gx product family. And over the next two years we anticipate the mix of our multi-core revenues will remain weighted towards TILE-Gx. However, to become a multicore market leader we are leveraging technologies and expertise from EZchip and Tilera to build what we believe will be one of the most powerful next generation family of multicore processors, the TILE-Mx product line.</p>
<p>We view the TILE-Mx as a leading multicore solution for networking and SDN/NFV opportunities. We estimate potential growth opportunities for the TILE-Mx may allow for expansion of our current multicore TAM, and could be a key driver of future EZchip growth in coming years. We see the multicore markets as very strategic for our growth; in particular those related to NFV and virtualization, in carrier, data center and cloud networks.</p>
<p>Like the NPU market, we believe EZchip’s multicore products offer strongly differentiated technology, which may allow for increasing market share in the coming years and potentially becoming a leader in the multicore CPU market. The TILE-Mx remains on track to deliver customer samples in the second half of 2016.</p>
<p>Looking at our second quarter revenues in further detail, quarterly revenues from Cisco reached a record $9.8 million, equaling 35% of revenues in the second quarter, up 4% sequentially and up 15% from the second quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>We expect revenues from Cisco to continue to grow in 2015, and anticipate Cisco may represent roughly a 35% customer for us. NP-5 has moved to production and we expect all of Cisco’s NP-3 and NP-4 based platforms to migrate to NP-5 overtime. We believe the potential still exists to add new NP-5 and NPS platforms within Cisco. It is our expectation that NP-3 will continue to sell for approximately one more year and NP-4 will continue to sell for several more years.</p>
<p>We believe that NP-5 will ramp up over the next three years and continue to sell for several years beyond that timeframe. Although the NPS-400 lost the initial bake-off for next generation ASR-9000 line cards to an internally developed ASIC, we will continue to try and win it back with the NPS-1000. We believe that the NP-5 replacement will not start to sell before 2018.</p>
<p>Quarterly revenues from ZTE totaled $2.5 million, reaching 9% of revenues, up 15% sequentially and down 49% from the second quarter of 2014. We have said repeatedly in the past that revenues from ZTE are not spread evenly throughout the year and thus we believe investors should measure ZTE on an annual basis.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2015, ZTE selected the NPS-400 for its next generation carrier router line cards. We believe ZTE’s endorsement of the NPS-400, prior to tape-out, reflects the continued trust, and support between the two companies, which started with EZchip’s NP-1 and has spanned thru several generations of EZchip’s NPU products.</p>
<p>Quarterly revenues from all other customers totaled $16 million, reaching 56% of revenues in the second quarter, up 4% sequentially and up 85% from the second quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>During the first half of 2015, we delivered strong year-over-year revenue growth from our group of other customers. Total other customer revenues during the first half of 2015 equaled $31.2 million, implying first half year-over-year growth of 90%. Continued year-over-year growth within our other customer segment is consistent with our long term goal of increasing customer and market diversification.</p>
<p>For the full year 2015, we estimate other customer revenues continued growth. This group of other customers includes many routing and non-routing customers, some of them with a potential of becoming 10% customers in future years.</p>
<p>With regards to the coming years, we expect the significant investments we have undertaken related to NPS and the TILE-Mx to pay off, with NPS starting to contribute revenues potentially as early as 2016 and TILE-Mx revenue contribution currently expected to begin in 2017. Given the majority of investment in NPS and TILE-Mx are already included in current OpEx levels. We do not expect OpEx to increase substantially in the coming years resulting in improved operating margins. We believe emerging trends in service provider markets, such as SDN/NFV, may shift the future sourcing of networking equipment. Service providers, and large data center operators, could become leading merchant silicon customers as they utilize white box designs, which are forecasted to incorporate both third-party software and merchant silicon. We remain confident our unique NPS architecture will allow EZchip to remain a leading merchant silicon provider for many years to come.</p>
<p>We anticipate near-term growth will be driven by the combination of opportunities within both NP-4 and TILE-Gx products, with NP-5 shipments continuing to see rapid customer adoption during the second half of 2015. Growth in 2015 will come from a mix of both legacy and current products, as well as the first full year of multicore contribution to EZchip results. It is our belief we will likely see continued benefit from our NPU market leadership, which should allow for year over year growth in our 2015 revenues, non-GAAP EPS, and NPU market share.</p>
<p>With regards to guidance for the upcoming quarter, we expect revenues to be at the range of $30 million to $31 million with gross margins in a range of 75%.</p>
<p>I would now like to turn over the call to our CFO Dror Israel for a more detailed financial review. Dror?</p>
<p><strong>Dror Israel</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Eli. In order to better understand our business we are providing both GAAP and non- GAAP results. While we discuss the non-GAAP results on this call, the GAAP results, and the reconciliation between the figures, are included in our earnings release. The non-GAAP financial measures mainly exclude the effects of stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets.</p>
<p>Now to the results, revenues for the second quarter of 2015 totaled $28.3 million, up 28% from the $22.1 million in the second quarter of 2014, and up 5% from the $26.9 million in the prior quarter. Cisco accounted for $9.8 million or 35% of revenues; ZTE accounted for $2.5 million or 9% of revenues for the quarter and our other customers, as a group, including all Tilera customers and including Juniper, accounted for $16.0 million or 56% of revenues.</p>
<p>Non-GAAP gross margin for the quarter totaled 76.7%, down from 80.9% in the second quarter of 2014, and up from the 74% last quarter. The decrease in gross margins compared to last year resulted mainly from the full consolidation of Tilera, representing lower product gross margins. We expect 2015 gross margins to be at the range of 75%.</p>
<p>Non-GAAP R&amp;D expenses net for the quarter totaled $7.5 million. This amount included $2.2 million in R&amp;D grants received from the Israeli Office of the Chief Scientist. On a gross basis, our R&amp;D expenses for the quarter totaled $9.7 million. Non-GAAP operating expenses for the quarter totaled $11.3 million, compared to $7.1 million in the second quarter last year, and compared to $12.7 million in the prior quarter. We expect that our annual OpEx level in 2015 will be in the range of $48 million, down from the $52 million projected last quarter, driven mainly by the successful synergies achieved through the Tilera integration as well as higher than forecasted Chief Scientist contribution.</p>
<p>Non-GAAP operating income for the quarter was $10.4 million, a decrease of 3% from the $10.7 million operating income in the second quarter last year, and an increase of 44% compared to $7.2 million in the prior quarter. Non-GAAP net income for the quarter totaled $10.9 million, 1% down from the record $11 million net income last year and an increase of 45% compared to $7.5 million in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Fully diluted EPS on non GAAP basis was $0.34 for the quarter, down from $0.36 in the second quarter last year and up from $0.24 in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Moving over to the balance sheet, cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities and deposits totaled $189 million as of June 30, 2015, compared to $184.1 million at the end of the previous quarter. Cash generated from operations during the quarter was $10.4 million. Cash used in investing activities was $0.8 million. Cash provided by financing activities was $4.4 million, of which $4.7 million was used to repurchase shares as part of our share buyback program. And $0.3 million was generated from the exercise of stock options. An additional $0.3 million decrease resulted from unrealized loss in marketable securities.</p>
<p>Last quarter, we announced a 20 million share buyback program. During the second quarter, we have repurchased 294,000 shares at an average price of $16.15, totaling 4.7 million. Following these purchases, we have $15.3 million remaining in our current buyback program. We expect to be opportunistic with buybacks during the second half of 2015 with future purchases subject to our share price, trading volume and other factors.</p>
<p>With that I would like to open the call for the Q&amp;A session, Operator?</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we’ll begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question is from Gary Mobley from Benchmark. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Mobley</span></strong></p>
<p>Eli, I want to circle back with you on a comment you made related to your dependence on the Cisco ASR-9000. So, if I look at 2015, it looks like you might generate about $42 million in revenue from Cisco. Approximately what amount would measurement dollars or percent will be tied to the ASR-9000? And are you stating that what Cisco is developing internally is worth only the ASR edge router line cards?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>I cannot comment on an internal Cisco ASIC and what platforms going to target. I can only say that our belief is that there are other platforms in Cisco that we can target with NPS and obviously with NP-5. And as we stated, currently about a quarter of our revenues are related to the ASR-9000 and that compares to about one-third of the revenue about a year ago. So, the growth in other customers actually makes us I would say very less dependent on the ASR-9000 today compared to where we were a year ago.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Mobley</span></strong></p>
<p>And just a dig a little bit deeper if I can. I’m assuming that translates into about 35,000 to 40,000 annual unit shipments tied to the ASR-9000. Do any of these new Tier-1 design wins for the NPS, whether measured in unit volume potential or total dollar value in potential, stack up to what you may eventually lose in ASR edge router?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>If you look at revenue of $30 million that are contributed by the ASR-9000, that $30 million also provided with $30 million of profit, that can be replaced by $45 million of revenues from other platforms and other customers that will provide us with a profit of about $30 million if we set the gross margins of close to 70% which is difficult. So, we’re talking about replacing that platform with revenues of $45 million. And I think that’s related to about 50,000 NPS. I think that with other opportunities that we are seeing within the new markets, within data center and cloud, we see opportunities combined are much, much higher than 50,000 chips and every design win there is different than the other and design wins that we’re announcing now with Tier-1 customers of that case are only the first one and design wins like this can open many other design wins for NPS. Because remember NPS can actually do any networking function. And based on the white box concept the customer can give the white box and then by putting different software packages on the NPS, it can get different functionalities. And that can be translated for us to many different design wins.</p>
<p>So the short answer is yes, the potential is much, much higher when we’re taking all these opportunities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Mobley</span></strong></p>
<p>Last question I have is for Dror, more likely. If you look at the $4 million in downward variance, relative to the prior OpEx expectation of $52 million, how much of that delta is a function of increased R&amp;D grants and how much is a function of maybe some headcount reductions or refocusing on specific product initiatives?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>So, first of all, we are not calculating the headcount reduction. It was not part of the plan synergies. Basically it’s about roughly 1 million, a little bit more than that comes from the Chief Scientist and the remaining three coming from other kind of synergies and cost saving mainly relating to a various R&amp;D actions like combining array [ph] services, IPs, software tool good listing [ph] that we were able to combine between the two companies. These things actually happened much faster than we initially anticipated and thus enabled us to outcome [ph] of the conservative assumptions that we took at the beginning of the year. And then last quarter we went down from 55 to 52 and we are now going down to 48 which we believe is realistic number for this year.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Joseph Wolf of Barclays Capital. Please go ahead. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joseph Wolf</span></strong></p>
<p>I had a question about the life cycle of the product. If we think about the NPU life cycle, it’s almost 8 to 10-year. You gave a lot of detail about the white box and the data center businesses. It feels like those should be faster and I’m wondering how you’re going modulate your development plan and how we can think about the revenue ramp and these kinds [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that NPS is highly complicated device and I think that’s even when we are looking at white boxes, I think that we should look differently at white boxes with the basic functionality like a switch or white box that is adding a lot of intelligence to the network with applications like load balancing and stuff of that nature. I think that white boxes of that nature will live much longer. So, I don’t see customer replacing them as fast as they would replace that. And so I don’t know if the life span will be eight years like it is with carrier. But I don’t see it much less than this.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joseph Wolf</span></strong></p>
<p>So, you think the trajectory when we go back to the old NP-4, NP-3 roll out and think about how the NP-5 is progressing, that’s the way to think about the NPS also, maybe across more divergence for customer base?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think that it would be pretty similar. Although this is possible that it will come out with more models. So, it’s not that we’ll just have one chip every three years, it is possible that we’ll have variations of the NPS that will come sooner than as we have seen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joseph Wolf</span></strong></p>
<p>And just a question about contacts, we’ve been covering the company for a while and you have the situation with Juniper. And I never heard you as optimistic about getting back into Juniper as I hear you now about relationships expanding with Cisco. Are there specifics about what happened at the Cisco, product portfolio, management changes or things like that that have you as optimistic as you sound about getting back with that customer? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>When we lost Juniper, we lost Juniper, the company; we did not have other design wins there. Juniper is a much smaller company. Cisco is much bigger. There are different business units. And Cisco should not really be viewed as one customer. Cisco is much customers and we have multiple design wins with different parts of the company. And that will continue and we have good relationship with them and hopefully we can have more design wins within Cisco. Specifically about the ASR-9K, I cannot tell you if there is -- we hopefully can win. They are pretty fast on the product. I think that NPS-1000 is highly differentiated the way that we are defining it. We have a lot of time to get it into the market. So, we are hopeful to be able to get it fixed. But regardless of this, as I said before, Cisco is not just one customer.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from [indiscernible] of Jay Srivatsa with Chardan Capital Markets. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jay Srivatsa</span></strong></p>
<p>Eli, it looks like some of the end markets on the service provider side are firming up but we’re also hearing concerns in China about the economy there might be weakening. Are you concerned as you look ahead to specifically or customer ZTE on how things to play out in the next few quarters?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>So, ZTE, in the first half of last year they did quite a lot of activity for over 10 million and these six months of this year they did obviously a lot less but we still believe that year-over-year ZTE can go still. And so what we are seeing right now in the third and fourth quarters make us believe that ZTE will go. We are seeing good orders coming from Huawei; we are seeing new activities with Huawei Telecom. So overall, we are not seeing any declares from our Chinese customers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jay Srivatsa</span></strong></p>
<p>Your commentary about Marvell and why now you believe you are the only sole provider of merchant silicon, can you expand on that partnership and how you see yourself working together going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that this is petty early stage and Marvell reorganized their networking business unit and they’ve decided to work with us instead of promoting their accelerated product. So, every customer now that they’re approaching, we actually approached them together; we visit customers together and we promote the NP-4, NP-5 and NPS as the ultimate for NPUs. We believe that from everything that we’re seeing in the market that we are the only provider now of high speed NPUs. And it’s important to say that NPS is targeting the market that is much, much boarder than the market that we targeted with the NP product line, mainly because of the addition of the data center and their cloud. And the capabilities and features that we have built into the NPS, makes it unique. It’s fee-based, [ph] it uses Linux for operating system, it can support Layer 4-7 and that leapfrogged other NPUs in this market. And I think that that helps other NPU vendors to discontinue the product line. So, not only it is highly differentiated and has not competition, the NPS is also targeting a much, much wider market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jay Srivatsa</span></strong></p>
<p>Last question from me on Cisco, you made a commentary that there are several divisions within Cisco that are your customers, but if we look back, I mean it’s very unlikely or very rare for companies that have internal solutions to go out and buy merchant silicon as an alternative. How do you see yourself playing there? Do you see major opportunities or are you cautious, are you optimistic, can you give us some sense on how you see this playing out over the next few years?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that in the next three years, they will continue to use the NP-3, 4 and 5 in the ASR-9K and others as well. And at the same time, they’re developing in-house chips. There have many divisions, many product lines and many in-house chip development and at the same time, they’re using many different merchant silicon chips. So it’s not -- it’s a company, it’s not like black or white. There are many, many different colors in between. And every different platform can use different chip. And we’re seeing a lot of opportunities within Cisco regardless of some interior. [Ph]</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Mike Burton of Brean Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Burton </span></strong></p>
<p>First on the gross margin, it looks like your non-Cisco gross margins jumped back up kind of mid-60 in June quarter from the low-60s the last two. Was there any onetime impact there or can we think about kind of mid-60s gross margin run rate going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I’d say but generally when you look at the gross margin portfolio, we are modeling Cisco as basically 35% of revenue coming at an average over 95% gross margin and then the reaming 65% of the other customers selling at direct selling model at an average of 65%, anything between 60% to 70%. So, it’s all the matter of the product mix and customer mix that makes slight changes between the quarters. But generally speaking, it’s getting us to the 75% range.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Burton</span></strong></p>
<p>And then with the new Tier-1 customers, when are we expecting them kind of collect with you to hit material revenues, may be kind of 10%, is that really kind of Q4 timeframe or is it next year? And then does that change anything to your gross or operating margin as those customers around?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>You mean the new design wins?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Burton</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>The new design wins, we just start the design work once the sample will be available and we are talking about the time frame of at least two years before we’ll see more introduction. It’s really the evidence of entering this new market segment that we have worked so many years to benefit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>We’ll see some sample going production already next year. And it takes about a year for a product like that going to production and then about another year to ramp up. So, we see revenues going gradually and ramping up. As Dror said, within two years to the level this is meaningful production level.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mike Burton</span></strong></p>
<p>And we definitely think some of the sampling and the facts become pretty material. On OpEx, just wondering if you make us see that amount going down or probably too early to get a hand on 2016 OpEx but may be you can help us with the target percent. We jumped this year to low 40% percentage wise, your guidance suggests a little more than that. Are there any puts and takes going forward into 2016 we should think about related to product ramps? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think that for modeling purposes, I think the OpEx numbers for 2016 at this point and it’s quite an early point but we believe 52 million for next year is a realistic number to use.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Paul McWilliams of VISO. [Ph] Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I have two questions. One, could you give us some insight into the NPS average selling price? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>For NPS will be in the ranges of $1,000 something like that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And I wonder if you could expand a little bit on the financial arrangement with Marvell. How is revenue, profit, certain things shared or isn’t shared?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>So, previously demonstrated -- Marvell manufactured chips sold to Cisco, we got a royalty and they sold it us for the other customers. That’s not the current arrangement. Current arrangement that we are talking about is we are manufacturing and selling the NPS. We work closely with the Marvell in the sense that they’re promoting these to their customers and further is the need for network processor. And we will continue to work closely with them to make sure that all nets [ph] in the future are aligned and they and us are developing chips that can work well together. But we are going to manufacture and sell our chips.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, on the NPS, Marvell doesn’t get at an any revenue or profit?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>They don’t.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So, their motivation is just building together with the NPS their associated chips?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>One housekeeping question. Dror, you mentioned Cisco at a 95% GPM. Now you paid off the OCS for the NP-4, did you pay it off also for the NP-5?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we paid all the contingent liability associated with NP-4 and NP-5. So we are completely clean. Of course it’s getting filed up with the NPS but this year before we’ll have to start paying royalties. 95% is not because of Chief Scientist it’s because some of the platforms are coming from direct remodel, mainly from the multicore product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I failed to consider that; my fault. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next question is from Richard Neaton with Rivershore Investment Research. Please go ahead. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Neaton</span></strong></p>
<p>The cash balance will continue to increase in the third quarter and fourth quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So, basically we are generating operating profit and we definitely expect cash to continue growing. We continue to pursue buybacks. As I said, it’s going to be opportunistic, so we can’t exactly say how much and when, but generally speaking we expect cash level to continue increasing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Neaton</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. With the only variable being how much you spend on the buybacks?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dror Israel</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So, beyond operating cash flows which continue to be positive and very similar to the non-GAAP operating margins, we have had expenses relating to share buybacks and purchase of IPs and other stuffs that are not part of the P&amp;L. And so, we expect to maintain high levels of cash. We say that repeatedly, we view the large cash balance as a strategic tool to go after all kinds of expansion opportunities including possible M&amp;As as we did with Tilera which are very happy about.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Neaton</span></strong></p>
<p>Eli, during the February conference call, you noted us multiple design wins at second Tier customers for NPS-400; has not number increased in the last six months?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we continue to additional Tier-2 designs wins. We think it’s important to understand that we really don’t see competition to NPS in the sense that there are now other merchant high speed NPUs. So, I think that every customer today that is looking for merchant NPU will probably work with NPS. So that will open many opportunities, especially new ones now that we’re partnering with Marvell and believe that they’re customers are looking to their next generation product will be working with us. And so, we’re very optimistic about it, not just with Tier-1 but with every customer.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Neaton</span></strong></p>
<p>On your second Tier-1 carrier routing design win for NPS, is that an existing NP-4 customer? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Neaton</span></strong></p>
<p>Finally, a general question about NFV and the NPS-400, a couple of years ago and when you began describing the NPS-400, you predicted that one thing that would happen in NFV was that the CPUs and data center servers could become overwhelmed by data playing and acceleration functions for these virtual functions that would be placed in them. Are you seeing, with these proof of concept trials now being taken for NFV, are you seeing your productions validated with the evidence?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think that servers will not be able to perform acceleration, network acceleration in any meaningful way when compared to a product line NPS or the MS that is now in development. There are several software packages that try to do that and do some acceleration but it’s few orders of magnitude below the NPS performance. So, I think that what we viewed then is happening. And there will be utilization of networking functions. And think that that’s exactly what we are trying to do with both NPS and MS.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Steve Barker of Mowani Camp. [Ph] Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Eli, there was no mention in the call about the June 2015 revenue earn-out from Tilera. Is it fair to assume that payment was not and will not be made?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, your assumption is correct. There will not be any earn-out payment. So, we’re pretty much done with this acquisition.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>I believe there was a still December, 2015 earn-out, is that not likely to happen?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Eli Fruchter</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s not likely to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] There are no further questions at this time. Before I turn the call over to Mr. Fruchter for the concluding statement, I would like to remind participants that a replay of this call will be available on the company website at www.ezchip.com.</p>
<p>Mr. Fruchter, would you like to make a concluding statement?</p>
<p><strong>Eli Fruchter</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you operator. I would like to thank everyone for joining the call today. I am really pleased to be able to provide good news and tell you about design wins in a product that took us four years to develop with a huge effort and lot of expenses. And we are very, very happy that we are really reaching the point where the product is stepping out. It was a huge effort and we are excited with what we are seeing around us and the design win momentum and very certain that NPS would be extremely successful. And I hope that we will be able to continue and provide you with good news. Thank you very much for all your support.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. This concludes the EZchip second quarter 2015 results conference call. Thank you for your participation. You may go ahead and disconnect.</p>
