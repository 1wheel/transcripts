<p>As with past practice, this morning Paul will provide an overview of the results and operations and Gordon will follow up with some details on the financials. Please note that this briefing is being webcast. We also have a number of people online, so please use the microphones during the question and answer session.</p>
<p>Before we start, I draw your attention to the Forward statement disclaimer contained in your packs and with that, I'll hand you over to Paul. Paul?</p>
<p><strong>Paul Perreault</strong></p>
<p>Well, thank you Mark. Good morning ladies and gentlemen and welcome to the CSL results. I really appreciate your interest in the Company. As Mark said, the first slide, just take a close look at the disclaimer and note the legal notice relating to the presentation and the forward-looking statements for the results.</p>
<p>So, CSL, as you know, has a history of really delivering our results and I think that this year is no exception. We've had a very solid result that was produced and it's on the back of robust demand, with sales $5.5 billion and revenue up 7% at constant currency, certainly delivering EBIT of $1.8 billion up 10% of constant currency. And after we adjust for the acquisition, it was up at 12%. NPAT at $1.4 billion, up 8% at constant currency, or 10% after the acquisition.</p>
<p>Certainly R&amp;D investment continues, $463 million and EPS of 11% at constant currency, after adjusting for the cost up 13%. So, the dividend that we are producing, as you can see, was pretty robust at AUD0.90 which is up 39% in Australian dollars. So I think a really good outcome for the Company and a very, very strong result this year.</p>
<p>So, in terms of highlights for the business this year, I think when we take a look at the acquisition of Novartis global influenza business, we certainly had a bit of a run on that news recently as we have closed the acquisition early. Which really is fantastic and we'll talk more about that later as we talk about Seqirus which will be the new name for the Company, which means securing health for all of us, so it kind of rolls of the tongue very nicely I think -- it's Seqirus.</p>
<p>The bioCSL business turnaround, this is something that we have talked about for the last couple of years, that we needed to turnaround the bioCSL business here in Australia and that has returned to profitability. Hizentra we had the European and US approval for our flexible dosing, which really gives patients some real advantages -- I'll take more about that.</p>
<p>And very, very excited about the submissions for two of our recombinant coagulation products that we've been talking about for quite some time, that's been in our R&amp;D portfolio recombinant factor IX fusion protein and our recombinant factor VIII single-chain product.</p>
<p>CSL112 and rHDL -- I'll talk a bit more about that but we've had very strong results in terms of recruiting for that trial and we have completed and AUD950 million share buyback which is completed this past financial year. We are foreshadowing a new buyback, similar to the amounts that we bought back this year. We are also foreshadowing a private placement which Gordon will talk more about a little bit later.</p>
<p>When we take a look at the facilities and the expansions and what we're investing for growth, I have to say this is probably one of the most exciting times that I've seen at CSL for some time.</p>
<p>We broke ground on our recombinant coagulation plant in Lengnau, Switzerland. This is a very large, $500 million facility that will be used to produce recombinants and antibodies in the future.</p>
<p>We have completed validation runs for the new Privigen facility in Broadmeadows here in Australia which is fantastic, because it's part of the global supply chain for this ever growing product in the immunoglobulin space on the back of demand. And construction is underway for the new albumin facility in Broadmeadows, so a lot of building happening here in Australia here as well.</p>
<p>We did obtain FDA and other regulatory approvals for our new base fractionation facility in Kankakee, as well as our new albumin expansion in Kankakee. So again, on the back of demand and the growth of albumin, really wanting to make sure that we're keeping up with that demand.</p>
<p>We did break ground on a new packaging facility in Marburg. This will de-bottleneck a lot of the packaging issues that we've had in Marburg through the years and so that's really good to see that we're moving that forward.</p>
<p>We started our project to expand the Berinert production capacity, anticipating the R&amp;D coming through on our Berinert subcutaneous high volume product -- high concentration product.</p>
<p>In the collections area, because you have to collect the plasma in order to keep up with the demand and fill these plants, we opened 21 centers in the USA, plus 1 in Hungary and that increases our fleet in the US to 119 centers and 128 centers globally. I would say that there's no one in the industry that's been able to open that many centers in the course of a year. So we do it extremely efficiently and I say it's all about meeting that global demand.</p>
<p>As we move on, you would be familiar with this slide that talks about the group revenues and certainly I'll go into more detail, but since the last time you'll see a movement of albumin from 12% to 14%, based on the demand, IVIG moves from 27% to 29% and plasma-derived slightly down, although beyond good unit growth. You'll also be familiar with this slide which is really the broad sales reach that we have in the organization and again, the shift in the North America and Europe is mostly due to a shift in the strengthening of the U.S dollar. As we look to the outlook for fiscal year 2016, we're still projecting revenue growth at 7% in constant currency this year, so similar to what we delivered this year although on a bigger base. So I'd say that just enhances the opportunity for us to look at this business as a business that still has strong underlying growth in terms of demand. We're looking at reported NPAT growth of 5% at constant currency, excluding the Novartis vaccine business earnings acquisition cost, et cetera. And EPS growth will exceed NPAT growth driven by past and our current projected capital management initiatives, with the board to consider this further on-market share buyback program, similar to the amount that we did this year. So this continued solid demand that we see going out is really exciting. I would say that this year, we are investing even more in the business than we normally would in anticipation of the launch of our recombinant portfolio. We have to really expand our opportunity in the commercial aspects. This is a competitive market as you all know and so when we look at our sales force sizing, we look at our marketing initiatives, we look at our product differentiation initiatives. There is additional money being spent on the commercial side this year. Our R&amp;D investment will continue this year and we are absorbing some depreciation from the assets coming online that I talked about that were approved this year.</p>
<p>You know, we're fairly conservative when it comes to these things and we have a straight-line depreciation, so the management of our strategy that we've had through the years has brought these facilities online. So now that they're approved and operating that depreciation hits us this year, so there's a headwind there that we'll reinvest. Basically what we're doing is reinvesting a couple of percent profit back into the business this year between commercial R&amp;D and the depreciation from our assets coming online. When we take a look at the product sales this year, you can see, as I mentioned, the 7% up at constant currency and I'll break this more into the -- out in the presentation, but albumin was up 12% and close to 20% in China. Our specialty products were again highlights growing at 15% and 18% if you take out the wound healing area which is struggling a bit in Japan. And total IG up 5% and coag up 3%.</p>
<p>So if we move into the immunoglobulin area and talk a bit about the IG, as I said, sales up 5% at constant currency, but as you know, if you strip out the hyper immunes which are a little bit of a drag. Although, I have to say we still have strong demand for Rhophylac, the growth for Rhophylac isn't as robust, and that's a big part of our hyper immune portfolio. The normal IG was up 8%. We did see very strong growth in Europe on the back of the CIDP indication and also North America had good growth, also there are some headwinds in terms of the 340B utilization and the competition that is moving product into the U.S. The subcutaneous IG growing strongly. I would say that Hizentra continues to be a stand out force across the globe. The only differentiated subcutaneous product in terms of the 20% high concentration product. And I have to say, the flexible dosing option for home care company for the home care convenience for patients has really been underpinning that demand. We have over 10,000 patients calculated on Hizentra, so we think growing extremely well and will continue.</p>
<p>As we look into -- just a note for you, the immunoglobulin growth in the second half -- because there were some questions at the mid-year about, you've got half-on-half and we tell you not to pay too much attention to the half-on-half, but I do have to say, as we said, we would continue to grow based on the initiatives that we started in the first half last year and the year before. So these initiatives start to pay off and you actually see that for the second half, we had 15% growth in normal IG, with the North American and European colleagues and commercial operations doing a great job. So I think it was -- just again, underpins the fact that we still see good solid demand for IG moving forward.</p>
<p>Albumin sales up 12% at constant currency, ongoing strong demand and certainly improving penetration in China in our Tier 2 and Tier 3 cities. The U.S had solid demand as well and I think that's been going extremely well. You know, in China, there are a lot of uses for albumin and that's one of the reasons for that growth. Whether it be in the ICU, oncology, sepsis, cirrhosis, there is a number of indications that actually drive that demand in China outside of some of the utilization that you would see in the more developed markets in the US. So I think that's really what's driving a lot of that China demand. In terms of haemophilia, we were up 3% at constant currency and really when you take a look at the growth in Beriate or plasma-derived factor VIII in Brazil and Poland and Germany, those were areas that we saw some very good unit volume growth and solid performance in our Von Willebrand factors with Humate and Haemate.</p>
<p>Certainly, there is an ongoing transition in the recombinant haemophilia space, one of the reasons we're investing in recombinants for sure, but I have to say that if you look at the data and look at things like the World Federation of Hemophilia, they estimate that there's still about 75% of patients globally untreated on a regular basis with haemophilia.</p>
<p>So when we look at this, there's still an opportunity for plasma-derived going forward and that's why we see more and more utilization of the capacity of factor VIII and we do think that this will continue as these markets evolve and over time, we'll see that transition again from plasma-derived to recombinant and I think we're well placed in that space.</p>
<p>Helixate did grow about 1% even though we did have the competitor pressure of new products being launched and all of the noise around the recombinant portfolios. So not too bad, I would say good performance on the haemophilia side.</p>
<p>Specialty products, you know again, very good growth, 15% at constant currency and if you take and strip out the wound healing business which again, in Japan, has been hurt by a number of new competitors and change in utilization within the Japanese market, we actually grew at 18% with our major products being driven with Kcentra, Berinert and Zemaira.</p>
<p>Certainly the self-administration label of Berinert that we got a year or so ago has continued in terms of patient uptake, we're now 75% of patients currently taking Berinert or self-administering. So I think this has really been a fantastic effort in terms of differentiating our product and our portfolio.</p>
<p>Zemaira, we have acquired a number of new patients on Zemaira and it's really been driven by the proprietary DNA blood test kit that we have for diagnosis of Alpha-1 disease. We now have distributed over 9000 of these proprietary DNA kits in the US. So I think that we will continue to see things move.</p>
<p>Kcentra, you know people ask me about that, and they say, well you must be pretty well done. And I say, well no we've done pretty well and we've grown to over 2000 hospitals now that are stocking Kcentra, but there's still a few thousand to go I would say in terms of the number of hospitals in the U.S. so room to grow continually.</p>
<p>When we look at bioCSL, and I talked about this in terms of return to growth, John Anderson and his team that head up our bioCSL unit here in Australia, have done a very good job at driving us back to profitability.</p>
<p>The sales growth that we see in terms of that was driven by the influenza sales in the northern hemisphere and the reestablishment really of our commercial capabilities in the US. We had a distribution agreement with Merck for a number of years, that came to an end, we decided not to renew, and Merck as well, and so we had to re-establish this commercial capability in the United States.</p>
<p>And I think it's just at the right time being that Seqirus is coming on because now we can align the commercial capabilities from the Novartis business and the bioCSL business in the northern hemisphere which will be great.</p>
<p>We also achieved last year, and even in this current year, first to market status with the U.S., U.K. and Germany. What that means is that if you're first to get your product approved and released in the market, you tend to get a stronger uptake of that product initially because people are waiting for those releases. So our ability to do that along with our expertise in this area I think, just point to the strength of our business in flu and the knowledge that we have which only underpins the reasons why we would purchase the Novartis influenza business.</p>
<p>In terms of IP and licensing, you can see that, it was down about 5% at constant currency and the HPV royalties were at 106 million. The registration of the 9-valent HPV vaccine by Merck is great because it will cover five new serotypes, which will then cover 97% of cervical, vaginal, vulvar pre-cancerous. Now the uptake is going to be what we need to look at and see how many patients will get the top up in the next vaccination to cover those additional cancers.</p>
<p>In terms of our other projects with CSL362 and our license agreement with Janssen Biotech, they continue to commercialize this and they've moved ahead and expected to commence their phase II study shortly which is fantastic. And the collaborative research that we do with Janssen has shown that there looks to be other areas that they could move this product into in terms of diagnoses or utilization in other diseases.</p>
<p>Our AstraZeneca MedImmune collaboration with our G-CSFR product is in phase II B studies for rheumatoid arthritis and we have received, or they have published some additional positive phase II data, so we expect that they will continue on the process with that particular project and it's looking quite good.</p>
<p>As we move into R&amp;D, I just can't help but smile when I think about our R&amp;D portfolio. We're very fortunate as an organization to have a robust portfolio of R&amp;D coming through. This is all part of the strategy that I outlined two years ago when I took on the role, which was really commercializing the strategy that we've invested in through the years.</p>
<p>The commercialization of bringing our recombinant factor IX fusion protein, which should be the first one -- the first cab off the ranks -- will be fantastic. This data really supports best in class efficacy for the recombinant factor IXs. So compared to our competitors, and the data that we released that I pointed some of you to at the ISTH meeting back in June, you will have seen that we really have data supporting 14 day dosing and the BLA has been accepted by the FDA. Also we now have the review under way in Europe, so things are progressing quite well with our recombinant factor IX.</p>
<p>Recombinant factor VIII-single-chain, again, the dosing supports twice weekly dosing on that product, so we'll be very competitive in the space. Our BLA was recently accepted by the FDA. So we had filed it and then waiting on acceptance. They've recently accepted it, which means it's in train and on track to go through the approval process. Still a ways to go because it's not done until it's done, but we are very excited about the data and the strength of the registration and submission that we put in.</p>
<p>Recombinant VIIa fusion protein for congenital deficiency -- so factor VIIa -- in the phase I and phase II trial has commenced, and our phase II/III patients -- in patients with inhibitors -- has also started, so progressing the next recombinant across our R&amp;D portfolio.</p>
<p>The Hizentra flexible dosing and the CIDP orphan drug designation that we've recently achieved is just, again, fantastic news for an ever-growing product that is differentiated in the marketplace. So Hizentra is just a product that keeps giving, and certainly keeps giving to patients, which is the most important piece of it.</p>
<p>Continuing with our R&amp;D, because I could put many more slides, but I have at least two. The commencement of the Beriplex trial in Japan for our phase III study is ongoing. Again, if you remember, when I talked about our specialty product portfolio it's about taking this portfolio and continuing to expand it across the various geographies that we do business in. So it's to launch these specialty products across our geographic strength and breadth that we have.</p>
<p>Berinert pivotal phase III subcu study is recruiting extremely well. Patients have only had an IV option up until this point and so what we see is patients clamoring to the trial, which is very encouraging. I would say that shows a real need in the patient community for subcutaneous administration.</p>
<p>Zemaira, or Respreeza, as it'll be titled in Europe, to treat patients with Alpha-1 deficiency and really take care of the decline in lung density. The EMA and CHMP recommended granting marketing authorization for Respreeza to treat patients in June, so we're now awaiting EMA approval. So now that we have the positive recommendation, our next step will be to look at the registration of that product in Europe.</p>
<p>CSL112 is doing very well. I would say we started our phase IIa -- we completed our phase IIa and the data supported the mechanism of action. Then we said we were starting the phase IIb, which is really a 1200 patient safety trial, and to date we already have over 600 patients on therapy. So we've more than half way recruited already. It's recruiting like a train really.</p>
<p>Again, cardiovascular disease, and death from cardiovascular events, there's certainly a high need to address in the global community. So we're very encouraged by the ability to recruit rapidly for this trial. So far, things are going extremely well, so we haven't run into any major difficulties at this particular point.</p>
<p>So I'm going to stop there for a moment and I'm going to hand over to Gordon. I'd just like to say I want to thank Gordon for all of his support in the CFO role. You all know that Gordon will be, and has been, appointed to the Head -- President of the Seqirus Organization that we'll be doing, but he's been a great help to me in my transition at CSL. You're still in the role for a while, so don't leave. But -- until I get this succession done which, by the way, is moving along. I welcome Gordon to the stage.</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Naylor</strong></p>
<p>So thanks, Paul, for those kind words and good morning everyone. As Mark said, I do plan to take you through some of the financial details behind the results, which Paul's announced this morning, and attempt to give you a better understanding of the underlying performance of the business in FY15 and what we can expect in FY16.</p>
<p>As part of this I will take a look at the margin development and cover the cash flow and balance sheet. I also want to give you an update on how we're managing the financing side of the balance sheet. Then, finally, given my new role, I will let you know our latest thinking on the now expanded influenza business which I will be heading up.</p>
<p>As you're all aware, NPAT for the financial year came in at $1.38 billion, which, after allowing for US$22 million of integration planning cost, is equivalent to growth of 9.7% in constant currency terms. Currency represented a net headwind of US$33 million. As you know the Swiss franc appreciated suddenly upon removal of the ceiling against the euro by the Swiss National Bank in January, but within a few weeks the effect of this did wash out and over the last few months the Swiss franc has tracked well with the euro. The big year-on-year currency movement that we should think about was the strengthening of the U.S dollar against all our other major operational currencies, notably the Australian dollar, the Swiss franc and the euro. This was favorable from a transaction perspective as our net cash receipts are in U.S dollars, but adverse where the profit from the various parts of the group were translated back into U.S dollars. The effects are opposite, but not equal, giving the net headwind.</p>
<p>I would also note that the appreciation of the U.S dollar has generally depressed the balance sheet by about 10%, with the exact effect varying for each line in the balance sheet. You can also see this overall movement in the movement in the foreign currency translation reserve. As a side note for Australian domiciled investors, the weakness of the Australian dollar does mean that translating economic performance back into the local currency has been very favorable and you can see that in the Australian dollar denominated dividend growth, for example. The other point I want to highlight from this slide is that the FY14 result included the March 2014 settlement of the long running class action, which had the effect of depressing the profit in that year. If you adjust for this, as well as currency and the integration costs, you can see that our operational NPAT growth in FY15 was about 6.5% over FY14.</p>
<p>This pair of charts has become a staple for the last few results. As a reminder, these are simply based on the U.S dollar reported numbers back over the last 10 or so semesters. EBIT margin is a pretty standard measure, but to re-explain EBITDAR&amp;D, it's intended to show a pre-investment view of the profit structure. It's the pre-tax profit of the Company if we hypothetically ceased re-investment in the business. Clearly, unsustainable, but a useful measure of operational efficiency. To calculate it we've simply backed out the whole R&amp;D expense from EBITDA. As you'd expect, there's a certain amount of noise in the semester ratios, attributable to some operational events, but also exacerbated by currency and accounting that arises from a long working capital cycle. EBIT is noisier as it's further down the P&amp;L and exposed to more of these effects, as well as to the lumpiness of R&amp;D investments which respond to business needs rather than the accounting periods.</p>
<p>The trends do look moderately favorable, but I would just note that the transactional currency tailwind is modestly inflating both of the second half margins in the financial year. So it's best to think about the underlying margin structure as remaining reasonably steady. If I could move to financial discipline. Cash flow was, again, good this year, up moderately on last year which, in turn, was particularly strong. The working capital cycle expanded slightly during the financial year due to some payment timings across the year-end, and also as our plasma collections caught up a little with the strong demands for albumin and our immunoglobulin products.</p>
<p>At the half year I suggested that CapEx would come in between $430 million and $450 million for the full year. As you can see here, in practice, the result was a bit lower due to capital project lumpiness and helped by the strong U.S dollar. A number of major contracts were denominated in the weaker currencies. This CapEx figure does include $34 million for the [wrap] of our intellectual property that we licensed from BioCryst. This is detailed in note 7 of the notes to the accounts. As a result, free cash flow was very strong for the year. CapEx has eased back a little over the last couple of years from our peak of $450 million in FY13. That's been the result of the current major round of projects approaching completion in several cases, and Paul has covered how close we are on some of these.</p>
<p>For the coming financial year we do see three big projects get under way, a big expansion of the basic vaccination operations in Kankakee, the recombinant facility in Lengnau, Switzerland, that Paul mentioned is getting under way, as well as the new AlbuRx facility here in Australia at Broadmeadows. As a result we do anticipate that CapEx will be around $500 million for the coming year, and we'll give you an update on how we're tracking in February.</p>
<p>I would also highlight that similar to the NPAT and sales guidance that Paul has given, these CapEx numbers are exclusive of the former Novartis influenza operation which we've now acquired. Overall, I think you'd agree the balance sheet is in excellent condition. I'm also very pleased with the term structure of the $2.3 billion in gross debt that the company carries. This is the refinancing profile on this chart of that debt, running out over the next 12 years. As you can see, we've taken advantage of the multi-tenor nature of the U.S private placement market so that the refinancing risk is really very modest in any single year. As Paul has foreshadowed, we do anticipate tapping that market again in the next few months, and we'll be looking to fill in a couple of the gaps and generally maximizing the average tenor of the borrowing portfolio.</p>
<p>In addition, our floating interest bank debt will mature in November 2016. That's the big bar on the left there. We do also plan to approach the bank market in the next few months to ensure that this line is renewed well in advance of that November 2016 date. Also, as part of that exercise, we'll refinance a bridge facility that we put in place a few weeks ago to fund the Novartis influenza transaction.</p>
<p>As you're all aware, we've had a long run plan to moderately gear the balance sheet with a loose net debt target of one times EBITDA, outside of acquisitions. The chart shows here the steady progress we've made since FY09 and we've done this through a series of on-market buybacks funded from a combination of significant free cash flow and debt raisings.</p>
<p>Over that time considerable value has flowed to shareholders from the increasing balance sheet efficiency. The cumulative EPS growth benefit over that period is about 23%. With the completion of our most recent buyback of $950 million we have net debt of about 0.9 times EBITDA. This is subject to Board approval, as Paul mentioned, but we do anticipate starting a further buyback of a similar amount sometime in the now current financial year.</p>
<p>If I can shift gears for a moment and talk about the recently completed acquisition of the Novartis influenza business. We are planning to combine this operation with bioCSL into a new subgroup that will be name Seqirus. As I think you'll be aware and as Paul mentioned, I'll be heading up the combined business. The process, as Paul mentioned, to select my successor to the CFO, is well advanced and I expect to affect a smooth handover sometime in the next few months.</p>
<p>We are very pleased to be able to announce the early close, which followed excellent progress and integration, and early resolution of the various preconditions to closing. The first two weeks of ownership of the new business have been very smooth, which I'm pleased with, given the complexity of the deal.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it is too early for us to provide you with any meaningful update on the financial picture for the new business beyond what we've provided in the past. We simply don't yet have enough detail and the complex acquisition accounting is really only just starting. We are working hard on both of those work streams and I do anticipate being able to give you a better picture in the next few months. We then expect to share with you updated financial views of the incremental business and the integration, along with an estimate of the gain on acquisition.</p>
<p>As we noted in our ASX release, the major incremental effect of the early close on the P&amp;L will be additional sales associated with the northern hemisphere influenza season. The ongoing expenses of the business which is loss making over the full year -- mean that there will be limited net effect on earnings for the extra five months. Apart from that, we haven't seen anything yet which has materially shifted our overall view of the acquisition.</p>
<p>The results for the first half for Seqirus will be consolidated into CSL's Group accounts at the half year and I anticipate that we'll expand the existing bioCSL segment to encompass all of Seqirus at that time.</p>
<p>I'll close with some more detail on the FY16 outlook that Paul has provided. I'll start by re-emphasizing the point that the guidance excludes any effect of the Novartis transaction, but does include bioCSL, which is also, of course, part of the base result for FY15. This means that the guidance is comparable with FY15 after adjusting for the integration, planning costs and currency.</p>
<p>There's a couple of items that you should consider as you work through the guidance. Firstly, as Paul mentioned, we haven't seen any real shift in market structure. Demand for the finished products continues to be strong, with our sales forecasted to grow at about 7%. The market does continue to be very competitive, with governments and other payers seeking to minimize their input costs, but this is nothing new and we believe that we are well placed to compete vigorously in this environment.</p>
<p>Secondly, as Paul has said, FY16 is a year of investment. We do anticipate the launch of several very valuable products in FY17 and preparation of our commercial organization is already under way. Setting up this commercial infrastructure in advance will depress earnings growth slightly in FY16 but positions us for success in the following year.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we've seen quite a number of facilities come online during FY16 and Paul spoke about that as well. As we do take a conservative accounting approach to depreciation and generally just use the linear method rather than trying to match depreciation with usage, the transition of these assets into a working state will trigger additional depreciation that will also depress earnings growth to some degree.</p>
<p>It's an accounting effect that will wash out over time. The P&amp;L is not highly sensitive to depreciation, but the effect will be there. We've taken these items into account in formulating the guidance and they're worth about $50 million together in FY16.</p>
<p>I'll finish now with a comment about our new simplified presentation of the financial statements that I first alluded to at our interim results briefing. At the core the statements remain the same, with the format of the notes being to make them more relevant and accessible to readers. We've had very positive response to the new layout, but please let us know if you see opportunities for further improvements.</p>
<p>With that I will hand back over to Paul to discuss strategic growth plans for the Group.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Perreault</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Gordon. So you will also be familiar with this slide, but it does outline for you, in general, the growth plan that we have from a strategic standpoint. I just do want to remind you back to a couple of years ago when I took on the role of CEO and we were talking about the fact that we were going to be moving into a commercialization phase with CSL and really trying to optimize all the benefits that we've had through the years of growing this organization.</p>
<p>These things are now starting to pay off and you have to really make sure that you're well prepared to commercialize the benefit of all the investments that you've made in the business.</p>
<p>I am somewhat humbled when I go to the plants. Those of you that would have been on the plant tours this past year will know that we have some really major -- major construction going on across the globe. So whether it be in Germany, whether it be in Switzerland, whether it be in the US or in Australia, we have major construction sites that are operating to prepare for the demand of products because, at the end of the day, CSL has done very well, but we also do very good for patients.</p>
<p>The only way to make that happen is to make sure that you have the capacity ahead of time, that you're collecting the plasma in advance and that you actually have the capability to produce these products for these rare and serious diseases where these products are non-discretionary.</p>
<p>So with that as the backdrop to the strategy, I'd say we are focusing on our core product portfolio, as you know, so the continued demand in Ig growth and albumin continue to fuel us forward, in terms of the underlying base of the business, as well as our geographic expansion and market expansion for the core products.</p>
<p>Secondly, really hitting that specialty product growth, which again has been a highlight for the last couple of years, in terms of specialty product growth, with high margin products growing at a double-digit rate, which has been great. Now the launch of the recombinant coagulation portfolio coming up and closely upon us, which is, again, extremely exciting for the organization as the next step in our phase of growth.</p>
<p>Then on top of that we have our specialty in kind of biotech products, our biotech portfolio. In terms of the antibodies, whether they're antibodies that we're developing in-house, which we have a number of early stage antibodies in-house, as well as our partnerships that we have with people like Janssen and AstraZeneca MedImmune. Managing that portfolio of biotech products is very important and what we have here in Australia in terms of our research and antibody development is extremely beneficial and important to us at Bio21. So that basic research of really driving it forward is really helping to drive that.</p>
<p>But on top of that, CSL112 has continued to show the effects that we thought it would show when we started the development of that project. So with CSL112, the strength of the recruitment at the phase IIb encourages us. The mechanism of action, of actually taking that unstable plaque and metabolizing it through the body, so that patients at high risk post-MI hopefully will be prevented from a second attack within the near term after their first attack, and that's really what we're trying to get to. So heart disease is not going away in society and this is a major opportunity if we can get this product across the line. A ways to go yet, but I would say that certainly what we've seen so far, we're very encouraged on the development in this portfolio.</p>
<p>As I said earlier, I could probably point to four or five more slides on R&amp;D, because it is quite a robust portfolio that we have within our research and development group. The addition of Seqirus and looking to really build that business to a leadership position over the next couple of years is another area of growth that we are looking to, in terms of not only growth within the organization, but also growth in the leadership of CSL as a competent and stable entity that continues to deliver, not only for shareholders but more specifically for the patients that are served. The prevention of disease, which I think people underestimate when it comes to influenza, a very serious public health issue around the world and we can be leaders in that field. So, again, it goes hand in hand with the history and the culture of CSL.</p>
<p>So all of this together I think has shown that we have a very good and solid strategy. The demand for our products continue to grow. As Gordon pointed out, we are reinvesting about 2% of profits back into the business in addition to our normal spend this year in preparation for really optimizing the opportunities that we have moving forward. That's all the strategy that kind of pulls it together.</p>
<p>We thank you for your attention, and I think, Mark, with that, I'll close the presentation and we can move to some questions.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>A - Mark Dehring</strong></p>
<p>We do have quite a number of calls online, but we'll take some questions here in Melbourne first. So [Maria] would you mind -- Andrew Goodsall, please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Goodsall</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much. Andrew Goodsall from UBS. Just to clarify the guidance, just the way that I'm thinking about it. If I just look at what you achieved this year, eliminating for the settlement the previous year, you did about 6.5% constant currency. Then going forward into if I sort of normalized for the effect of the investment, the new costs, you're sort of saying basically something of the similar magnitude going forward. So you're basically saying more of the same. Is that a good synopsis, or a good way to think about it, correct way to think about it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>That was the read through. It's consistent with the fact that we haven't seen anything really fundamentally shift in the marketplace or our own operations, it's what you'd expect. We just wanted to make it clear that, for example, the growth -- we didn't get undue credit, if you like, for the fact that the earnings were depressed in FY14, from the class action settlement. But that's the read through, Andrew.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Goodsall</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, which is terrific. Then -- so I guess just trying to understand what's in there, just what you've thought about for recombinant factor IX coming on later in the year? Then I noticed you won the Australian import contract for IG, so just what you think that does in terms of those earnings.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, look, it's all part of the -- it's all embedded in there, Andrew. So we have, in our budgeting process, embedded those aspects into it because they are part of where it is. As you know, there are areas that don't grow as fast. So even though the plasma-derived factor VIII did grow slightly, it's on a lot of volume but at lower pricing. So there's always swings and roundabouts in these things. But I would say that we've taken into account the fact that the Australian agreement is there. I mean, it's helpful, it's not -- I wouldn't say it's going to shift the dial immensely but it's part of the IG growth story. In terms of where we look at for the -- I'm sorry, what was the other one that you asked me?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Goodsall</span></strong></p>
<p>Just the recombinant IX, how long --</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, the recombinant IX. So depending on when we get the approval for the FDA, I would expect we'll be launching it in the second half of this fiscal year. So we'll get the uptick of a few months of sales and that's calculated into that growth as well. But really next year when it comes through is the full year of growth and driving it forward into the markets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Goodsall</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and one final one for me. I notice you broke it out in the charts, but you didn't give us an absolute number on subcutaneous in the second half, just to save us having to rule the page there. Subcutaneous growth, or year-on-year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Mark, maybe you have that number?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>I'll come back to you, Andrew, afterwards. It's strong is the answer.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, strong. Strong, very strong. We want to give you an accurate number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Abbott, please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ian Abbott</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, good morning, thanks for taking my questions. I mean one of the strengths of CSL's business is its global sales network. Just wondering what you're seeing in terms of relative growth rates around the world in your key regions. Particularly given, you know, there is a fair bit of turmoil in the Middle East, Brazil, Russia, there is a fair bit going on plus I suppose you've got competition in the U.S. So just wondering if it's relatively uniform across the world, or there are some areas of weakness?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, there is always differences in markets, Ian. I think the thing that I point when people ask me this question, is really the fact that the economy is independent of disease. So there are patients in need all over the world. So whether it be in a Middle East country that's in turmoil or whether it be in Russia or wherever, patients need these products, they're non-discretionary. So what we've seen is that the governments that can support the utilization of these products make sure that there's access for these patients and they pay for these products. You may have a difficult time if you're in the primary care area, but in these particular products we see good demand. Now in Europe, for instance, we had extremely strong growth this year in Europe. People have been talking about the demise of Europe for quite a number of years, so I would say that that's there. North America, again we had very good growth in North America, so that's going. Then we are still winning tenders in Brazil, Poland and Hungary, so people are still tendering for these products.</p>
<p>Again, I think it goes back to the unique nature of CSL in the product portfolio that we have, as well as the breadth of commercial reach that we have. So we're able to access the markets with our commercial reach. There is a need for these products, and so the governments are still tendering for these products, and we're able to compete in that space.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ian Abbott</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Perhaps one for Gordon on the buy-back. He is got sort of a loose target of one times EBITDA, you're getting quite close. Is the best way to think about that is that you may announce a buy-back of similar size to the previous buy-back, but the timing and pace of that buy-back might ease so that you don't breach that one times EBITDA limit?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, I think that on the question of buying patterns, that tends to be more set by the market and liquidity and it comes and goes a bit. But, for example, in most years we haven't been able to complete them by the end of the financial year but we do complete -- most years we get them done by the end of the calendar year that we have or -- sorry, the full year, the 12 months that we have to do them in. So that's sort of just even flow in the ordinary course. I think the other comment which I'd make is the target is a loose one. So the idea is to, you know, if you go a bit above or you go a bit below, it's not something I think we're going to manage to with a micrometer would be the other comment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ian Abbott</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ian. We'll take a few questions online. We have David Low. David?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Low</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much. Perhaps if I could just start with a question around pricing and competition. CSL's listed prices for a couple of products this calendar year, just wondering how you see the pricing environment, both the price rises and what we should expect, what you expect going forward, please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks. Look, I would say I'm not going to comment a lot on pricing in this forum. But I would say that if you take a look at it, a lot of it is around our specialty product portfolio. I would say that still quite competitive in terms of Ig and albumin around the globe. So it's a matter of looking at the reimbursement who's getting reimbursed, how the products are flowing and where you might be able to occasionally have some uptick in terms of the availability of these products in those markets. So the pricing is -- I would say we don't budget for a lot of price increases in today's environment globally. I would say that that's really not the aspect. But certainly these medicines have high value and we want to make sure that we're extracting the value these medicines bring to patients.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Low</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thank you for that. It was also -- you made the comment that 340B has had an impact on the market. I'm just wondering if you could talk to what you're seeing there, and again, what you expect going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, again, you see an expansion of the 340B program within the United States, and this is for the disproportionate share of hospitals, so those hospitals that have the government reimbursement for these patients of no income or low income. And what the hospitals have done is try to expand the use of -- because there are certain aspects you can only buy inpatient versus outpatient in the 340B, so there's a differential in terms of where you're supposed to utilize a product that's purchased on 340B. But there's been an expansion of, I would say, the purchasing of 340B contract pricing by a number of the hospitals that are out there, and very large hospitals, where it's hard to really tell what's being used where, quite frankly. But some of the competition that's been around there, people have been offering 340B pricing across the portfolio for certain accounts. So its put pressure, I would say, on some of those larger accounts and that's where we see this continuing aspect.</p>
<p>So it's a government -- the U.S. is a very, very complex healthcare environment. People, I think, underestimate the complexity within the U.S. until they actually show up there. It's kind of like rushing to China to do stuff. Everybody wants to go and then you get there and you're like, it's pretty complicated. So it's the same with 340B and the U.S. healthcare, ObamaCare, and where the states are actually impacting the Medicare and Medicaid patients in the United States. So it's complex, but what I'd say is it continues, and there will be a continued pressure on trying to find a way to access products at a lower cost.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Low</span></strong></p>
<p>All right, thanks. Last one for me, you mentioned on R&amp;D spend, I wasn't quite sure I understood what you were implying for the year ahead. If it's relatively flat '15 on '14, something similar in '16, or is that ramping up?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, we're still going to be investing I think 8% -- we're investing 8% in R&amp;D and sales are growing at 7%, so we're still investing ahead of sales line.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>David, just to be clear -- be careful with currency on that. It does appear to be pretty flat but in fact if you do it -- there's a currency effect in there. So really, as Paul said, the R&amp;D investment has been pretty steadily growing with sales.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Low</span></strong></p>
<p>Is the FX impact in that largely Aussie dollars, we're talking [indiscernible] because you've got [indiscernible] </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, that's right. But because of course you're in U.S. dollars in the reporting and of course the currency has appreciated against all of those currencies as other currencies. So the actual growth rate was roughly in line with sales.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Prior</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. Paul, if I can just start with the guidance for fiscal '16. In terms of the revenue growth of 7% that you've talked to, the run rate that we're seeing in normal Ig, albumin, specialties, bioCSL, are all kind of tracking above that 7%. Can you talk to maybe some of the drag that you're seeing in fiscal '16, is it the hyper immunes or haemophilia, in the lead up to some of the recombinant launches?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Matt. Yes, I think you've hit on a number of them already. I think the hyper immunes are always -- it just doesn't grow as much as the other products. We're selling millions of dollars in Rhophylac and so it does have an impact if it's not growing on the Ig portfolio. You all will have seen the most recent PPTA data. I think we're still doing quite well against everything that's there. But we've seen some ups and downs and swings in there and we've just talked about some of the 340B and the pricing aspect, so there's a bit of a drag there, although we do expect to continue to grow with or above the market in terms of Ig.</p>
<p>And the specialty products you can see is becoming a bigger part of our portfolio, we've almost reached the $1 billion mark in our portfolio for the specialty products, so it's getting to be a bigger piece. That does certainly help in terms of the uplift of the 7% and remember that 7% is on a bigger number, so even though we had 7% this year, it's on a bigger number now, so its additional growth. But there are -- you picked up on the haemophilia, and that's true. The plasma-derived products are growing in volume, but it's at a very, a much lower price than the recombinants and so that is a bit of a drag. We see the -- the wound healing product in Japan, in terms of TachoSil and -- sorry, I've just lost --</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Our [wound healing] product?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I lost the name of my other product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>[It's Haemocomplettan].</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>But that's not very good. No, TachoSil is the product we sell and we have our own. But at any way, that market has been declining and there's a lot of competition there in Japan and so it was our largest franchise in Japan at one point and that's been whittled away over time. That continues to decline, actually, along with pricing decreases by the Japanese government, where they have their [yaka] price adjustments. So that's all been a drag as well.</p>
<p>So yes, it would be great if everything was growing, but we do have some things on there. You also saw the IP is lumpy, in terms of IP and licensing, so depending on what comes through. It's hard to predict the Gardasil royalties, some years you're surprised on the upside, some years you're surprised on the downside. So we just try to keep a normal and patient view on those things.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Prior</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great, thanks. Just one further question, just in terms of basically the Ig growth rate that you saw in the second half. Yes, the first half result you talked about kind of tactical product allocation across to Europe and that was one of the reasons for the 2% dip down in fiscal 2015. But given the growth you saw in that second half can you talk to whether there's an improvement in industry growth rate in Europe? Or do you see maybe some of your competitors still skewing their production to the US, which has kind of given you share in Europe for the near term?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes look, so let me just -- again, I've made this point but I'll make it again. It's not about allocating product; it's about where we put our growth in product supply. So, again, if you think about it in terms of, okay, we send it here and send it there and that's allocating, that's one thing. But it's -- again, we're not moving product out of one market and allocating it to another. We take a look at the growth and the demand based on patient need and that's where we ship the product. Because we're big enough, we're scaled enough that we understand there's going to be a mix on pricing. You do get a lower price in Europe than you get in the US, but that doesn't mean I'm not going to take care of the patients in Europe and when I'm there, I'm going to stay.</p>
<p>To your other question, there were a couple of competitors in the UK and France that struggled on some supply and we took advantage of it. One of the things I've always said, as a scale player you need to be able to step in if one of the other players falters a bit. So we did have a benefit from some production issues in the UK and in France which grew extremely well for us there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Matthew Prior</span></strong></p>
<p>All right, thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Good, thanks, Matt. Craig Collie.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig Collie</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, guys, for my questions. I've just got a couple, please. The first just around supply and demand dynamics. Paul, could you perhaps comment on how those are tracking given that you had a couple of competitors with supply issues over the last few years and a lot of people building capacity?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>So, look, it has been a number of years since anybody was really supply constrained, I would say, in terms of when people would say well, you know, we were lucky. Which I could debate, because I think it's all about the strength of the Company and the strategy that we've employed that gives us those opportunities. So without that, you don't have it. But I would say that the capacity that's coming online is all good if you have the raw material to fill it.</p>
<p>As I said, I don't know anybody in the industry, besides us, that's been able to open 20 new collection centers in the course of the year. So although people are struggling to keep up in terms of plasma supply, I wouldn't be worried about oversupply of plasma at the moment. Because you also see blood collections declining across the world, here in Australia, in Europe, in the US, as surgical techniques and more bloodless surgeries are performed, you're having about a 7% to 8% decline year-on-year in terms of blood collections. Which means that recovered plasma is not as available.</p>
<p>So a number of our competitors -- and we were still collecting or purchasing about 10% of our plasma supply. But part of our growth strategy is actually to replace that with our own plasma collection centers. So we are not only collecting for demand, but also for the anticipation that there will be less material available from other sources in the future. So we don't want to be dependent on an industry that's declining in order to get raw material to manufacture these products.</p>
<p>The capacity itself, we are running flat out and we're opening new facilities and we've got the new facilities we just finished and opened, and that's why the depreciation line was hit with things like the base fractionation expansion in Kankakee [and] the albumin suite. But now we're building again additional base frac and albumin in anticipation of two to three to four or five years from now. So it's all of this that you have to do well in advance. It doesn't all come online at the same time, right? Then you have to make sure that you have the raw material.</p>
<p>So I would say the demand underlying, based on what we've seen and based on what you see in our results and what we've guided for, for next year, is still quite robust. I would say that there's a long history in this business of people calling that the business is dying and yet we continue to grow. So I wouldn't say that -- I would say that the dynamics in terms of supply and demand are still quite strong and robust and that's why we continue to invest in the business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig Collie</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks very much. Last question, just on upcoming product launches. So some very exciting products coming to market in terms of your recombinant VIII and your recombinant IX and also the subcu Berinert. Any comments, Paul, on competitive dynamics and your expectations in terms of how you'll compete with those products, now that we're getting closer to their launch?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. You know, we're extremely competitive as a culture. But also I would say that our product portfolio, in terms of the offerings and the product differentiation, are fantastic. So our recombinant factor IX I do believe will be best in class, in terms of the ability to have zero bleeds after dosing with two weeks. You saw that in the data, or would have seen it if you look at the data from ISDH Pristine data, I mean, pristine, just fantastic, nobody has data like that. So I think that that's a big win for us. Factor VIII is really hard, and we've talked about that. Everybody wants to talk about long acting, but nobody has long acting, they have longer acting which usually means like one less dose per week and we're right there. So our recombinant factor VIII single-chain is right there and competitive with the others. We'll be making it ourselves and we'll capture more margin than we do under our current Helixate contract. So for us as an organization, that means a lot, because it's our own product that we're manufacturing where we can capture better margins on the product that we sell. So I think that that's extremely helpful for us as well. So I see that we will compete in that space well. Berinert subcutaneous I think is fantastic, because it's not only a subcutaneous product, but it's a high concentration subcutaneous product. So -- and we know how to do high concentration subcutaneous I think pretty well, if you look at Hizentra's results. So even though this is a different protein than IG, we understand the technology and the delivery of high concentration products in the subcutaneous space. So we're excited about that and I think well placed competitively for that product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Craig Collie</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Craig. David Stanton.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Stanton</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks very much for taking my questions. Just to start off with a quick housekeeping question. The 5% constant currency growth that you're forecasting, or you've guided to for 2016, is that on the reported net profit or the adjusted net profit after tax, please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>It's on the adjusted -- it's on the reported, sorry, Mark. I'm sorry, my apologies, reported.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Stanton</span></strong></p>
<p>On the reported?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>On the reported, that's correct. That's correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Stanton</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Then the second question from me, can you explain what the orphan drug designation for CIDP or Hizentra mean for you in terms of potential upside for volume growth and or pricing growth, please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Look, what it means is that it will make it really hard for anybody else to come on anytime soon and compete with us in that space. The pricing will be fair, as it should be in the market, we don't charge more just because we have orphan designation. I think it will be the value of the medicine that we place in the marketplace for these patients. So where we look at our outlook and what we expect, which of course it's not here yet so I won't really talk to what we've calculated, but it's all part of our strategic plan in terms of our growth moving forward. So I would say that what it means to us is more -- you know, just because you have designation, that helps, but you actually have to get approval to get that designation to impact your product that will really keep the competition at bay for a few years. Because you can have multiple companies with orphan designation, but then the one that actually gets the approval for orphan is the first one to get to market. But the others are well behind us, so I feel pretty strongly about our ability to get there first.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Stanton</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood, thank you. Final question from me. Gordon, any chance of giving us some color around potential tax rates for FY16, please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>I think, generally speaking, Dave, you get ups and downs. But we do see that the tax rates -- the ETR's been in the order of 19% to 20% for a while. I think 20% is probably a good number and we'll see what plays out.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">David Stanton</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Dave. Saul Hadassin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Saul Hadassin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, good morning guys -- or good afternoon. First question, just regarding collection centers, either for Paul or maybe for Gordon. Just wondering how material the 21 centers opened was with regards to impact on COGS. Then also, as we look to fiscal 2016, can you give us any comments on your thoughts on centre openings for 2016 and therefore similar impact on COGS, if any? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Saul. Look, there is a bit of a drag, because the centers are not to scale. So as you open new centers, you still have the cost of operating the centre, so you have to staff it, you have to make sure that the donors are coming in but, of course, you don't have the volume overheads to reduce your hours per donation, which is really a key factor in managing the costs in a centre. So I would say that it has had a drag and has increased the cost of plasma. I won't give you an exact number, but it's been a drag on that line for I'd say the last couple of years. Because we have been opening centers year-on-year every year, so there is a flow-through effect. I would expect that we'll continue to open centers this year at a rate that will meet demand for the future. So we do have a number of centre openings on the books for this coming year and that will also then be less efficient in those centers than in the current fleet. But as we have rolled these centers into our fleet over the last couple of years, you know, some of those centers are becoming much more efficient because of the volume that they're putting through, so that's been less of a drag, but you have more of a drag on the new centers.</p>
<p>So it's certainly there, it's in the numbers and so I think we've accounted for it. But it -- look, its hard work it's the hardest thing we do is collect plasma. So I would say that from that perspective we have to keep our eye on the ball there and make sure that we're efficient because we are opening more centers than anybody else. But I think we know that space pretty well, so I think we're in good shape.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Saul, just real quick, for me just to add a little bit to that, don't forget of course that the effect is usually delayed in the accounts because of the working capital cycle, that -- and as Paul said, it is a drag, we're sort of seeing it continue. The other thing -- I mean Paul touched upon this, but at the point of arrival once you do have these centers up and running they'll actually tend to make the overall fleet more efficient, because they'll be optimally scaled.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Saul Hadassin</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, not bad, it's good. Thanks guys. Just two quick follow-ups, again, maybe for Paul. Paul regarding two new products, well two products, one new one -- look, you're getting European entry, can you give us any quantification of the Respreeza opportunity for Alpha-1, in Europe particularly you haven't competed there before? Then just a very quick separate question, just with CSL112, just wondering if you could give us a guide as to when we might see headline data from that II B trial? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes sure. I wish I knew on the CSL112 question, but it really depends on the phase of recruitment, the data coming through. But it is recruiting faster than we thought, so I think that there are some looks that the Data and Safety Monitoring Board look at, so the separate independent board that looks at the safety of this product. So far they haven't seen any safety signals, which is great, even in the moderately renal impaired, which is a big question on the FDA side. So all things progressing on track. I think it will be -- if we finish up this year it will be sometime next year when we'll see some of the results from phase II B and go from there. But certainly hope to have some informing along the way.</p>
<p>In terms of -- sorry, what was the first one?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Saul Hadassin</span></strong></p>
<p>Respreeza's opportunity in Europe for you guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>The market in Europe is about 180 million, something in that range. So that's the current market. There's only been one product there and it's actually the older Talecris product. So it's the first generation Alpha-1 product, it's not the product they're selling in the northern hemisphere today, and it has more side effects. So I think the opportunity is quite good. We have also invested -- that's part of that commercial investment, we talked about recombinants, but we've had to gear up in anticipation of the launch of Respreeza in Europe because we haven't called on that group in Europe before. So that's another part of that commercialization piece that we're doing in terms of the launch of Respreeza.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Saul Hadassin</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thank you very much, that's all I had.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Saul, Will Dunlop?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Dunlop</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Two questions. Firstly, I'm just wondering what your expectations for gross margin are for CSL Behring FY16 and perhaps beyond? There's obviously a lot of moving parts, previous comments obviously around collection centre openings, price increases, but then geographic mix -- perhaps a bit of a drag as well. Could you just provide some color on that? That would be fantastic, thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Will. You've answered your own question on the moving parts, which is good. I think the read through, as I sort of said when I was talking about the margin -- on the margin slide, is that from our perspective you should really think about it as being pretty flat, like -- in the absence of better information.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Dunlop</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Will. Steve Wheen?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Wheen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, good afternoon. I also wanted to talk about margin. Gordon, you talk about it being pretty modest improvement and yet revenue on the constant currency basis grew by 7% and EBIT grew by 12%, what is providing that leverage at the EBIT line that perhaps you're not suggesting is taking place in the adjusted chart that you've put out in the slide pack?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>That -- by the way that chart hasn't been adjusted, it's just the raw numbers. So it's not adjusted for currency or anything. That's the basis of my comment that the effect of a transaction tailwind is to expand margin, it's as simple as that. So I think -- like there's no doubt that over the long run we've been able to get some operating leverage, there's no question, and you see it by the fact that for the -- the overheads in the business have generally grown more slowly than the overall business. We're pretty effective, I think, at maintaining a focused organization that puts its investment into the operating assets. So I think that would be broadly true. It's just that we are pretty cautious about people getting an exaggerated idea of near term margin, particularly when there's this confounding effect of inflation there.</p>
<p>So I think -- hence the sort of -- the thoughtful comments about not getting -- not building in too much by way -- or any really, in terms of margin expansion going forward. We need to recognize that structurally this is a very competitive industry. You wouldn't really expect to see margin expansion and particularly you wouldn't expect to see where CSL tends to outgrow the rest of the industry. I think it would be nice, but it's a bit hard to think it's all that realistic in the long run.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>But to quote my predecessor, they're beautiful margins.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Wheen</span></strong></p>
<p>And just a few quick R&amp;D questions. Berinert -- just around the timing -- has that changed again given you're still recruiting for the subcutaneous?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>No, it's the same timing that you would have seen at the R&amp;D day.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Wheen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay great. Then from the joint venture -- or the agreement you did with Janssen, is there any milestone payments that we can expect from that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Well hopefully.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Wheen</span></strong></p>
<p>So is that in the FY16 year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>No. I mean there's little bits here and there but no major -- nothing major that you'll be able to see.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Wheen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Steve. Sean Laaman?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Laaman</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Mark and thanks for taking my call. Just a quick couple of questions to help modelling. But, you know, we've already had the guidance of 5% growth off the $1379 million but just looking at -- I think it's page 8, you've -- Gordon provided some, I guess, sensitivity or the impact of FX movements on the numbers going from 2014 to 2015, just given that we're seeing similar deltas so far in fiscal 2015 on those various rates, would you kind of be expecting similar kind of FX headwinds in FY16 on FY15 if current rates prevailed?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, look I think it's a good question and we don't have a complete answer, but I can give you probably a couple of comments. First of all, broadly speaking you're probably right, because that trend effect that we've seen where the US dollar has been appreciating against most of the other currencies that are relevant to us, has continued. So, you know, there's certainly -- up until even the last two or three months which, of course, will affect the current financial year. So you would expect to continue to see a trend where you will have a transaction tailwind and a translation headwind and it may well be that the translation effect is dominant, it's a bit more than the transaction effect, and so you would probably see a net headwind.</p>
<p>We don't -- we think the effect is in the order of -- it's probably in the tens of millions but quite how much we can't quantify at the moment. I think we'll have a little bit of a look at that. It's a good question, but we just need to be a little bit -- make sure we've got our numbers worked out to give you a reasonable estimate of the actual number. But in principle, I think you're right. I think that that headwind is probably going to continue, and we'll probably be having a conversation in a year's time where we're talking about a significant overall net currency headwind for the FY16 results.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Laaman</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks for that Gordon. And just to clarify, some of those investments that are occurring during fiscal 2016, should we consider them as one offs or are they kind of embedded in the cost base and grows forward from there or otherwise?.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think in terms of the commercial result -- like they're not going to go away, but the -- in terms of the commercial investment you'll actually have some sales to support it. So I think it would be fair to say that the commercial costs as a percentage of sales will probably come back to where it was. So the costs won't go away but you'll have some sales -- they'll be supporting sales by then. It's a little bit the same with the depreciation too, like the depreciation -- it's a linear depreciation. You keep [taking] the same amount each year, but you'll actually have some production coming out of the plants. So the effect is that -- so I'd expect that the ratios in the P&amp;L to come back to where they were over time. That's a slightly different answer from the costs go away -- they don't.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, but I think that for this year it is additional costs that we didn't see in previous years, so I think that, you know, the depreciation line certainly hit us because these plants came online this year, but it will continue, as Gordon said. For the commercial aspects, we have increased. We've always been parsimonious, that's a nice way of saying it, in terms of our cost base, but when your commercializing products in a competitive space you'd better be ready and so you have to invest a bit more. Our per cent of sales to expense are still probably 5% to 10% less than what you would see in a traditional pharmaceutical business.</p>
<p>So we still toe the line pretty closely, but we have additional investments that we're doing this year that in previous years I would have been quite harsh on in terms of, you know, pushing back the commercial guys and saying okay that's too much spend. But there is a year here where with these products and with these high value products that we're going to be launching, we have to spend some more money. So as you say we will have to continue to spend going forward but this is kind of the year where it's hitting us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sean Laaman</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, thanks. [Technical difficulty] just one more sort of long term thematically -- do you kind of look at the recombinant factor VIII space, there's three manufacturers, four if you consider CSL -- currently a third party distributor, but maybe going to as many as seven products with different bells and whistles, but essentially three manufacturers going to seven, that -- do you see any risk or are you seeing any risk of sort of markets that are currently dominated by plasma-derived product are reverting to recombinant as a result?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Again, I think it will be some time. When I started in the plasma business in 1997 I was told that plasma-derived would be gone by 2000 and so we're still here and we're still producing probably more units than we ever have in terms of plasma-derived factor VIII. I think it just goes to the economies and the geographies that we treat around the world. So if you look at China with 1.3 billion people and you do the calculation, you would estimate that there's probably between 60,000 and 75,000 haemophiliacs and they've got about 5000 on the register in China today. So -- and these patients are all being treated on demand, they're not being treated with prophylaxis and you see that in multiple countries around the globe.</p>
<p>These are high cost medicines and that's why you see the tendering as well. I doubt if you'll see players getting into the recombinant space, building new plants, new technologies and then cutting their price to plasma-derived pricing overnight just to capture some of that market. You have to have the treatment methodology, you have to have the hospitals and the medical community set up to treat rare disease in these countries and that takes time as well. It takes governments, it takes medical community, the manufacturers and the patient communities all working together in order to get this penetration into the markets as opposed to a commodity tendered by the government for cheapest priced product. So the short answer is, yes you will see it move for recombinants into these other markets, but it will be over time. I don't think we're at any risk of that happening overnight.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sean Laaman</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay great, thank you. That's all I have.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks. We'll need to finish up soon but we've got two more people on the line. Chris Kallos?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Kallos</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks Mark. Just a quick question from me about the albumin sales. Paul, could you quantify the increase as it pertains to the U.S market out of that 12%? You talk about solid demand continuing, what gives you the -- what is your competitive advantage in the U.S market in particular? I understand you've been in China for a long time, so that makes sense, but are you growing ahead of the market? Can you just provide some clarity around that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, look, I think we're growing probably with the market in the U.S. I wouldn't -- I don't know if we're growing faster than the market in the U.S. But certainly we grew about 20% in China again this year, which is a big driver of that 12% growth of the albumin. The advantage we have in the U.S is we have the broadest portfolio of albumin in offerings. What I mean by that is albumin comes in different sizes, so you have a 5% albumin and a 25% albumin and the 5% is used a lot in the pediatric hospitals. We also have multiple sizes of the 5% and multiple sizes of the 25% and that breadth of product offerings is more than most of our competitors have. So in that sense we have some particular accounts that we've been able to drive into based on that mix of product that we have. Having multiple brands and multiple manufacturing sites with Albuminar out of Kankakee, and AlbuRx out of Bern, as well as being able now to produce AlbuRx in Kankakee, gives us more flexibility in terms of getting product to market quicker if customers need it. So we've got some logistics, we've got a product portfolio and a brand portfolio that I think differentiate us in the U.S market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Kallos</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Would it be possible to quantify your share in the market in the U.S?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Probably would be. Top of my head I don't know.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I don't know either. I'll come back to you Chris.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Kallos</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, we can come back to it. Thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Dehring</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay thanks Chris, and lastly but not least of course, Bruce Du.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bruce Du</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi guys. I just had a quick clarifying question on the incremental investment growth. Should we think about that $50 million in FY16 as sort of right sizing the sales and marketing force in anticipation of both the recombinant IX and single-chain? Or should we sort of think about single-chain as potentially requiring an additional step up in investment when that launches six to nine months down the track?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Perreault</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks. No, it would be for both in terms of the sales force and the sizing. There will probably be additional investments in marketing for the recombinant single-chain because we can't obviously do any pre-marketing until we get approval. So there will be some marketing uptick but it won't be the same as people, right, because it's one of -- probably one of the most expensive assets we have is people. So it's -- that's really where the costs -- you see a big cost there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Naylor</span></strong></p>
<p>Bruce, just to be clear, the $50 million includes both the investment in the commercial products and also the depreciation effect.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Dehring</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Bruce, and ladies and gentleman thank you for your interest today, I will draw the briefing to a close.</p>
