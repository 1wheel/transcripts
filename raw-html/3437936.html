<p><strong>Matthew Rosen</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Brian. And welcome to everyone, who has joined us on the call. We're pleased to speak today about our second quarter performance and go to more detail about our direction, goals and strategic plans. This is an exciting time for our company, as we emerge as a major participant in a rapidly growing and evolving industry. It is a pleasure to share those plans with you and progress we've made and continue to make in executing on those plans.</p>
<p>On today's call, I'll start with an overview of our strategy as well as our business performance in the second quarter. I'll then turn the call over to Don Hutchins to discuss our operational and financial performance in more detail. Then I'll review our key strategic goals in more depth, after which we'll open the call to your questions.</p>
<p>To provide some context, over the last two-and-a-half years Fusion has grown from $44 million of revenue to approximately $100 million in revenue run rate today. The portfolio of cloud-centric products we offer today to our existing and prospected customers, include software-as-a-service and infrastructure-as-a-service, as well as the underlying cloud networking component that bind these product offerings together, enabling us to provide best-in-class unified communications, cloud computing, security and cloud storage for every size of business and enterprise customer.</p>
<p>This positions Fusion as the single source for businesses, looking to move into the cloud, of course, shared by a growing number of businesses, both in the U.S. as well as around the world. One of the leading market research companies, Gartner, has estimated this to grow to $244 billion market in 2017.</p>
<p>Our strategy is centered around increasing our customer base through capital efficient growth, primarily through disciplined targeted acquisition, complemented by our partner, direct and inside sales efforts.</p>
<p>The company has demonstrated, through three acquisitions executed in the past two-and-a-half years, it's ability to identify high-quality cloud services businesses that we can acquire at attractive valuations, integrate tightly into our platform and gather synergies both on the revenue and cost side, generally making them accretive on a cash flow basis within six months, but often from the date of acquisition.</p>
<p>We also believe that as we continue to gain scale and add to our already large portfolio of products and services, our organic growth will increase, primarily through cross-selling and up-selling within our growing customer base. I'll speak more about this later on the call, but we are very optimistic about the opportunities our industry and strategy offer and our abilities to take advantage of these opportunities.</p>
<p>Turning now to the company's performance for the second quarter. Our total revenue for the quarter was $25.1 million, an increase of 8% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Fusion engages in two lines of business: our Business Services segment, focusing on cloud-based product offerings; and our Carrier Services segment, which provide interconnect services worldwide between large carriers. The Business Services segment contributed approximately $16 million and the Carrier Services segment about $9 million of the overall $25.1 million in total.</p>
<p>Revenue in the Business Services segment, Fusion's major focus, was up 3% year-over-year. And importantly about 85% of those revenues were contracted monthly recurring revenue or MRR, which we typically book through multi-year contracts.</p>
<p>Revenues from our Carrier Services segment were up 20% from $7 million in the year-ago period. This increase reflects a return to more normalized level of activity for Fusion, following the completion of network upgrades that now allow us to carry more minutes of traffic.</p>
<p>Fusion's adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was $2.2 million compared to $3 million in the second quarter last year. This reflects the investments we've been making in our sales and marketing and service delivery platform to support our growth plans. We expect this level of spending to grow, offset by cost reductions we're undertaking, which we'll discuss later.</p>
<p>When we look at our business, we focus on several key measures, which we believe are good predictors of future financial performance. These include: the number of customers purchasing Fusion services; the average monthly revenue per customer, referred to in the industry as ARPU; and the churn rate, a rate at which customers terminate services provided by Fusion. You will see these metrics in our quarterly announcements and earnings calls.</p>
<p>We ended the second quarter with approximately 10,820 customers. And we continue to have an average revenue per user, or ARPU, well above the industry average, coming in at near $500 for the quarter.</p>
<p>Our average churn for the second quarter was 2%, reflecting the bankruptcy and subsequent laws of two large customers that together represented over $1 million in annual debt for Fusion. Without these two one-time events, we calculate our churn rate at 1.2%. Again, materially lower than the industry average churn rate.</p>
<p>We continue to see opportunities to improve our performance in several areas, which Don will discuss later in the call, and which we believe will result in significant gains in both revenue and cash flow and add to the value of our underlying business.</p>
<p>With the majority of our new monthly recurring revenue contracted for three years or more, with automatic renewal upon expiration, we see the business is having a high degree of consistency and predictability. As a result of our focus here, we ended the quarter with $217,000 in monthly recurring revenue backlog, representing $2.6 million in total contract value.</p>
<p>Additionally, we signed $5.2 million in total new contract value during the quarter. Our focus has begun to shift from investing in building of a highly scalable network infrastructure, service fee, and product and marketing platform for accelerating the growth in revenues and cash flow.</p>
<p>A key element of our strategy to build the foundation for Fusion's organic growth is to further expand our sales force. Over the last nine months, we've doubled our number of sales professionals from 10 to 20 across our three channel, partner, direct and inside sales.</p>
<p>With the Broadvox migration behind us now, these individuals are fully engaged in their sales effort, and we plan to add several more sales professionals in the coming months. We will do so in a measured fashion, balancing the need to spur our organic growth with incremental overhead we will bear, while they ramp up to full productivity.</p>
<p>Additionally, we've made a number of organizational changes in our marketing group over the past quarter to increase the direct support of our sales effort. We've increased our marketing spend to accelerate results. And among our initiatives to increase organic growth, we've recently launched targeted marketing campaigns to promote brand awareness and increase lead generation, using cutting-edge automation and CRM tools.</p>
<p>Now, I'll turn the call over to Don, to provide some more details on our second quarter performance. Don?</p>
<p><strong>Gordon Hutchins</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Matt. And let me also welcome everyone who has joined us on our call today. To recap a bit, consolidated revenues in the second quarter of 2015 were $25.1 million or an annual run rate of approximately $100 million.</p>
<p>We have integrated the three acquisitions we made in the past two-and-a-half years, NBS in 2012, Broadvox in 2013 and PingTone last year. About two-thirds of our revenues now come from our higher margin Business Services segment, which is focused on cloud-based solutions and services. This is up from 5% from 2012.</p>
<p>Our consolidated gross margin in the second quarter was 44.9%, flat with the year-ago period. Gross margin in the company's main area of focus, the Business Services segment, improved over 200 basis points year-over-year to 63.6%. While on the Carrier Services segment, gross margins improved by 100 basis points to 11.6% for the second quarter.</p>
<p>We had a consolidated operating loss in the second quarter of $1.7 million compared to an operating loss of $30,000 in the second quarter last year. This was mostly due to investments we've made in expanding our sales and support platform as well as other investments to position the company to scale meaningfully.</p>
<p>Fusion's net loss for the second quarter was $700,000, down from a net loss of approximately $2.5 million in the second quarter last year. This improvement was primarily a result of the $2.5 million non-cash gain due to the change in the fair market value of our derivate liability.</p>
<p>During the second quarter, we continue to move forward with our major initiative to leverage the scale we have built and harvest synergies and efficiencies coming out of our acquisitions. We used some of these savings to invest in the areas that enhance our ability to scale.</p>
<p>We are already beginning to execute on the cost savings, which will include, for example, the consolidation of our data center at 75 Broad Street, New York, into existing locations, which alone we anticipate will save the company over $800,000 per year.</p>
<p>Moreover, now that we have begun to achieve scale, we have been able to negotiate more favorable commercial terms with our underlying suppliers. Looking at all cost reduction opportunities, we expect the majority of the annualized savings to be in place before yearend.</p>
<p>Turning now to our operational performance. We continue to make progress in the second quarter and strengthening our internal sales and support platforms to build Fusion's growth engine. Adding to this, our acquisitions have resulted in the expansion of our geographic footprint by adding eight new data centers, upgrading our network core and adding additional leading-edge service platforms.</p>
<p>On the organic growth side, we are focusing on growing our direct and indirect sales channels, and we are working to further penetrate vertical markets, such as the healthcare and hospitality industries. In the second quarter, we also announced the signing of major customers in the housing, building technology and global agriculture industries.</p>
<p>Now, I'll turn the call back to Matt to discuss our strategic goals for the business.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Rosen</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Don. As I mentioned at the beginning of the call, we've made significant progress in transforming Fusion to become a leader in cloud services. We've built a very strong management team, a robust flexible and scalable platform and a unique go-to-market strategy.</p>
<p>As we look ahead, we've identified three main strategic objectives for our business. The first objective is to continue to create significant scale, primarily through acquisition. This has been and will continue to be the main driver of our overall growth strategy, and we'll complement this with organic growth. In our business, scale is paramount, as it allows us to reduce our operating cost of our entire business, while lowering our cost of capital, thereby making future growth opportunities even more economically attractive.</p>
<p>We can either build or buy to achieve scale. While others in our industry have focused primarily on building scale organically, spending up to 50% of revenues to accomplish it, we continue to look at the financial balance between organic growth and growth through acquisitions. We believe that at this point the returns on growing our customers, our revenue and our cash flow, primarily through acquisitions, is significantly more attractive to us then doing so primarily on an organic basis.</p>
<p>We benefit not only from the fragmented competitive landscape and cloud services, but also from the inherent leverage in Fusion's operating platform as well as the experience and track record of our management team to identify, acquire and tightly integrate these businesses successfully. Our approach toward acquisitions is built around a highly disciplined process.</p>
<p>The criteria we use when identifying potential acquisitions is: a cloud services company focusing on business customers; a next-generation network infrastructure, avoiding legacy infrastructure; a low churn rate and high ARPU; a high percentage of recurring revenue; and an integration process, which can be undertaken with low risk and an accretive effect within 12 months.</p>
<p>Our second strategic objective is to optimize our capital structure, which is closely related to our acquisition strategy. At the end of June, Fusion had about $45 million in total debt, carrying a blended interest rate of about 11.2%.</p>
<p>This was a reasonable interest rate, when we made our first cloud services acquisition in 2012. But in recognition of our financial progress and current market conditions, we believe we can do better. We are constantly looking at how we can strengthen our balance sheet. And one of the areas of particular focus is our leverage, and we look at that along two parameters.</p>
<p>First, in looking at the credit picture, which is key in implementing our acquisition strategy, we examine both our total leverage and our cost of capital, recognizing that as our EBITDA grows as it has, we will also be decreasing the level of cash flow required to service or debt.</p>
<p>We have therefore made relevant decisions in terms of our capital structure and our capital deployment plans to support our acquisition strategy, and we are working to lower the interest rate on our debt. We're not prepared to go in further detail of our plans today, but we expect to share more about our progress on this topic later this year.</p>
<p>Finally, our third strategic objective is to continue to leverage our growing scale to drive efficiencies and cost saving, some of which Don described earlier. We're increasing our focus here to identify areas, where we can affect cost saving as well as harvest efficiencies accruing from our acquisitions.</p>
<p>We assign direct responsibility among the management team for each of these cost saving items. We track these as a team on a weekly basis. And as a result, we have the confidence in level and timing of these savings, which is critical to managing our business as efficiently as possible.</p>
<p>So to summarize, we're focusing on carrying forward our acquisition strategy, growing the business accretively, building scale, optimizing the balance sheet and improving our credit stats, and lowering our cost to generate greater cash flows, which we can ultimately return to shareholders and invest in future growth.</p>
<p>We continue to believe that our expanding scale, robust nationwide network with global reach and an end-to-end service, suite of innovative, yet proven cloud solutions, and our positioning as the single source for companies moving to the cloud, give Fusion a unique competitive advantage that will enable us to achieve meaningful value in a large and very dynamic marketplace.</p>
<p>With that, I'll turn the call back over to the operator, so that we may begin the question-and-answer session. Frank?</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Kevin Dede from Rodman &amp; Renshaw.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>So first thing, could you just speak to, I mean, there were flurry of press releases through the quarter, I think more than I have seen over the past year regarding some new wins. Could you just speak to the genesis of these new contracts and the length of sales cycle? And how your sales team from PingTone has ramped up?</p>
<p>And maybe a little insight on whether or not you're wining business from other providers or whether or not you think these companies are looking to adopt a class sort of from a greenfield basis? Whether or not, there are any household names? Just some more insight on the progress you made there, please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So I'll try to capture, response to all of that you've asked Kevin. So starting with the new sales that we've started to announce, I think there are couple of comments there. The first is, is that we've really renewed an effort to more effectively communicate externally. And as we have come up with the communications plan, I think it's important to really share the wins that we're getting.</p>
<p>And so as we are out here in the marketplace, one of the things that we're noticing more and more is that the larger customers, more complicated the needs the customers have, the more we stand out. And so as you'll see through some of the releases that we've sent out, the profile of the customers, although, in many cases we can't introduce the name, as you take a look at the profile of those customers and the solutions that we're providing, very few of them are just single solutions.</p>
<p>And again, as Kevin, you know one of the areas where we believe we excel is being able to provide a fully suite of solutions rather than just single products like most of our other competitors in this space. And so we're starting to see that adopt more frequently with our customers and we just want to do a better job of sharing those wins with other investor base and those watching the company. So that really speaks to the new releases, and we plan to continue that by the way on an ongoing basis.</p>
<p>And as you take a look at the sales, the sales team and the sales force, that's obviously something that we look at on an every day basis. As I mentioned during the course of the last month, we've actually doubled the size of the sales force. And the organic growth of the business is really geared towards the number of sales people that you have.</p>
<p>And as you know, when you hire a salesman, it typically takes them about six months, in order to ramp up. And so we've added an additional 10 sales people. We're continuing to look for sales people. It's important to note that the profile of the individuals that we hire, are what we call, solution sales folks.</p>
<p>And that means that it's not just guys and folks that can pick up the phone and call clients, but it's really those that can sit in front of CEOs and help design solutions to meet complicated needs. So we're looking for higher level sales executives that can really take our strategy into the market.</p>
<p>We've seen through the PingTone acquisition, and addition obviously of seven or eight direct sales force professionals. They are, I think, doing very well. Have ramped up nicely and are continuing to show progress on a monthly basis. Kevin, does that cover your -- ?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it covers most of it. Do you think any of these wins would be names of companies that most also recognize?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, they would.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Hutchins</span></strong></p>
<p>And Kevin, sometimes the larger the customer, the harder it is for those customers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Could you speak to whether or not some of them you won from other providers or do you think they'll look at a class solutions sort of as a new take?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>In several of the cases, at least the ones that we've announced, it was actually, some part of those solutions where taken from other providers and other parts of them were replacing legacy services. So really it's a mix, I would say, Kevin.</p>
<p>One is just replacing other people's services that are like services that we can either provide more features and capabilities and better pricing and better support and the other half of that is really that we'll look on more greenfield opportunities where we're going in there and helping that customer initially move to the cloud. So we're taking legacy software and legacy infrastructure and moving that to the cloud.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you talk a little bit, I mean, I know these numbers used to be reflective in press releases last year, but can you talk to sort of a backlog or bookings perspective in the business services side?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So at the end of the quarter we had about $215,000 of bookings, and again for everyone, benefit bookings are contracted, yet not installed revenue, so its customers that we won, but have not yet installed or have not been booked to revenue. So we have about $2.5 million of contract value in backlog right now. And again, just in the quarter we signed an additional $5.2 million of contract value and so assuming that those contracts on average are of three years, we can calculate what the annual impact is for those contracts.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Don mentioned consolidating one data center that could save us much as $300,000 per year. Could you speak to some of the other initiatives that you plan on undertaking in order to chop that $3 million out and could you translate those $3 million savings into sort of a targeted financial model for the end of the year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So let's first talk about the savings. As you look at the savings, there are a couple of categories that we look at, and two primary ones. One is what we would tag its facilities and the 75 Broad Street location is part of that category. There are couple of other opportunities in our facilities, which is office space or data centers where we believe there are efficiencies that we can drive.</p>
<p>The next is cost of sales. And as you take a look at us gaining scale as a business, as you gain scale, you are able to negotiate more favorable rates with various suppliers and we have successfully done that and we are leveraging the renewed pricing in some areas. And then the third is SG&amp;A. And SG&amp;A really falls in multiple categories, as we're all familiar with. And so as we have identified these savings, they are line item identified, so these are not a target of getting to $3 million, these are $3 million of identified savings in our business.</p>
<p>We track them on a weekly basis. We have folks that are assigned to each element of those savings. And already we've seen about a $1 million of annual savings been achieved just in the month of August on an annualized basis. So we are making good progress and believe that the lion's share of those savings will be completed before yearend.</p>
<p>Having said that we do plan on continuing to invest, so if I were to pinpoint an amount, I would say that close to 60% to 70% would be realized to the bottomline and the remaining would be used to reinvest in the business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Just on the sort of a target financial model is something that we might be able to look towards, Matt, for the fourth quarter report. Can you offer any insight there? I mean, how much do you think falls out of SG&amp;A and what happens to your gross margin line on a consolidated basis, just so have a general idea where you think things will go?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So I think that the gross margin will remain relatively, and as you know, Kevin, we have not been giving guidance and today we're not prepared to give specific guidance for the company, but suffice it to say, we expect to see the margins remain fairly consistent in the business. And as you kind of dissect what I went through in terms of the cost savings, you can apply that to the model, but we would expect to see about, on an annualized basis, that $2 million coming to the bottomline before yearend.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Given that we have Don on, could you offer a little insight on network status. I mean, you mentioned I think eight new datacenters, but could we just sort of talk to, I guess, where your number of POPs are and what your target is, sort of the CapEx plans, along those lines for the balance of the year versus say, the end of last year, just so we have a general target on what you hope accomplish?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>Don?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Gordon Hutchins</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Kevin, I think if you look at a year or 18 months back where we were, as we were just completing the Broadvox acquisition. We had 8 points of presence or data centers, which pretty much ran up and down to East Coast from New York to Miami and Honolulu served customers at that time throughout the country. But our largest concentration was East Coast.</p>
<p>As we completed the Broadvox acquisition and sort of build out the network, we move to more of a national footprint, where we both expanded significantly the number of national customers, whether they'd be geographically, central or west, or multiple office. We added several new data centers taking up to a total of 14 data centers, and they now stretch not only on the East Coast, but into the San Jose, Los Angeles, back through the central part of the country in Dallas, Chicago and so forth, so that we truly have a national footprint for the network.</p>
<p>As far as your question on additional growth beyond that, we feel that the footprint now covers geography of the U.S. very well. So anything we do beyond that is really going to be geared toward a growing concentration in specific area. So for example, if we suddenly got a large influx of customers in St. Louis, Kansas City, Canterbury and Midwest, then more economically we'll maybe able to drive additional cost savings or improve margins, by putting a data center in that region rather than serving them say from Chicago.</p>
<p>So it's really got the customer base driven, however, we expect that over the next two or three years, as we dramatically increase the size and scope of the business, we'll add data centers to fill in a couple of the areas, but probably not a huge number beyond where we are right now.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next question comes from Richard Haydon from Tipp Hill Capital.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Haydon</span></strong></p>
<p>The question I was going to ask, it was just asked on the $3 million and how much of that would lower the bottomline, but this was a good summation of the past and more important for the future of the company. So thanks for hosting the call.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>Richard, I appreciate it very much, the comments.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next question comes from Bill Sutherland from Emerging Growth Equities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>Most of mine have actually been handled as well. Now, I was curios on the acquisition pipeline. Maybe if you could just give us a little color on that kind of the sizes that look most promising, maybe durationally or I should say, timing-wise?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So we continue to see a very, very robust pipeline of acquisitions. And I'll start by saying that last year we saw a number of potential acquisitions for the company, and there were very few of them that met our criteria. One of them we bought and the other one wasn't feasible to move forward with, but we saw a lot of deals and we liked very few.</p>
<p>This year it's actually been quite different. We have seen a number of opportunities that we believe are very attractive for us. And again, we kind of define the criteria that we use in order to asses whether it is a good deal or not, but in essence, being able to buy these businesses at good values, to meet all of our criteria, we've seen a number of opportunities.</p>
<p>We are obviously, can only take on a certain number at any given time, given our resources and are very selective about that. So we see a very robust pipeline from a timing standpoint, as all we talked about, we expect to do one to two acquisitions a year. I still feel fairly strongly that that's attainable. And we are working towards achieving that.</p>
<p>In terms of size, Bill, it really depends. I would say the sweet spot of what we've been seeing are companies that are $10 million to $20 million in revenue. Having said that, there are opportunities that we see where a company could be considerably lower in terms of its revenue based and $10 million to $20 million, but we believe that we can take those products and services and sell them into our existing base.</p>
<p>So if it were a small business that we could buy, take those products and services, drive them into our existing base of customers and take that small business and grow very rapidly, given our cross-sell and up-sell strategy, that's something that we would look at as well. So for us, it's really, each deal has its own unique opportunity and we really take a look at all of the components in order to make a decision on whether to move forward.</p>
<p>And again, Bill, as I think you know, we've done three letters of intent in 2.5 years and we've done three deals. So we're very particular about what we like, but when we find something that meets our criteria we move aggressively toward close and even more aggressively towards the integration of those companies and that is a paramount, paramount focus of ours. If we can't integrate the business, we will not buy the business.</p>
<p>So we spend an enormous amount of time prior to even closing on an acquisition, on the integration plan, so the day that we actually do conclude the acquisition we're actually starting the integration, not starting the planning for that integration. So in short, very robust pipeline, a lot of opportunities out there still within the value parameters that we have set for ourselves and we believe that there are some pretty interesting opportunities out there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>And then as far as your capital structure relative to executing on that strategy, should we think about what you're planning at least for the balance of the year to be done with the way that balance sheet looks currently or -- ?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So this is an area, Bill, that again I would say, that prior to the end of the year, we're going to come out with a fairly detailed strategy of what our plans are around the capital structure. And the biggest component of that is really around the debt. And as we talked, the $45 million that we have right now priced at 11.2%, it was very good a couple of years ago for us, but doesn't represent, in our opinion, what we can get today. And so we are very actively looking at not only a way to reduce that leverage and that interest rate, but also partners for our future growth, and so you can look forward to hearing more about that in the coming quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>And then on carrier services, this level of revenue run rate you've achieved, should I think about that is being kind of like the new normal for that business as well as the gross margin?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I would say that within a 10% variance up and down, I think that that's a normalized rate of revenue growth.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Sutherland</span></strong></p>
<p>And so with the initiatives that you all are beginning to do on the cost side, do you think that will send, without getting into the real guidance, but your EBITDA is down a little bit or adjusted a little bit year-over-year lower, pretty easy on gross margins, so would that allow you to have up EBITDA comparisons going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So the way that I would like at it is we have spent in a lot of key areas to help expand the platform and lay the foundation for the growth that we've talked about. And the expenses that we have identified to reduce will really bring that back to a normalized level. So it's almost like we've increased expenses in the core areas driving growth and we're reducing the expenses in other areas. So Bill, the answer is, is that we will definitely see a decrease in the expenses driving an increase in EBITDA. In terms of favorable comparison, it's going to somewhat depend on the quarter that we are using.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next question comes from Ross Silver from Vista Partners.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ross Silver</span></strong></p>
<p>So, Matt, just a question for you as it relates to the statistic you threw out from Gartner, where it said cloud services I think it was $277 billion market by 2017. If you were to look at that whole pie, I mean what percentage of that pie would you say is fragmented and represent a prospective opportunity for Fusion?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So as you take a look at, the number was actually $244 billion. And in some respect, it's hard to segregate those numbers, because the Gartner's and the other research organizations out there don't necessarily break it out how we would all want to see it. But having said that, I think that there is certainly a large piece of that pie that is today in the hands of the larger providers, that you're probably looking close to half of that, if not more, that's accessible to companies like ourselves.</p>
<p>The other interesting dynamic that we're seeing in the marketplace is that as you take a look at the larger suppliers of either hardware or software, they're having to move themselves in the cloud as well, and that's causing them to take some interesting approaches to delivering the services.</p>
<p>But as you take a look at what our offerings are, our solutions are what those companies require in order to introduce their software or infrastructure into the cloud, so we believe that we can also benefit from some of the movement of the larger guys, because we are supplying in some respect the connectivity and some of the other services to enable those services to be delivered in the cloud.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ross Silver</span></strong></p>
<p>And then just a last question is, as it relates to customer account. I mean going forward sort of modeling the customer account, I mean how should we think about this kind of going forward through the end of the year, just kind of remaining flat or slightly increasing or how would you suggest we look at the customer account just going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So for us it's a lot more based on the size of the customers versus necessarily the customer account. So as we look for customers moving forward, we may pick up one customer at $20,000 a month, which is 40x our average ARPU, but we may only add 10 customers instead of 20.</p>
<p>So for us it's really about driving high-value customers to the existing base that we have. So we may lose 10 customers that are billing $200, but pick up one customer that's billing $15,000 of ARPU, where we believe that that's a better approach in going up-market. So I would tell you that our view right now is that customer account will increase for the rest of the year. But again, it's going to somewhat depend on the size of the customers that we're bringing in during those particular periods.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And the next question comes from Kevin Dede from Rodman &amp; Renshaw.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Matt, now that you're sort of halfway through September, can you give us sort of an eyeball on the trajectory there in light of the new wins versus those two large customers you lost?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>So Kevin, I think that what we're prepared to say today is probably to the extent that we're willing to, as it relates to kind of the rest of the year guidance. But again, I think we are certainly very bullish about the rest of the year, not only in some of the activities that you pointed out, but really showing that the three main objectives that we've outlined here are being executed on, the cost saving initiative, the balance sheet as well as continuing to grow scale in the business. And I would look for those three areas to make considerable progress before yearend.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kevin Dede</span></strong></p>
<p>Could you give us a little more insight sort of on the integration activates? Can you talk to what's going on in the back office with PingTone and whether or not the integration of Broadvox et cetera is pretty much done at this point? And what you're doing on the CRM side? I know you talked that a little bit, but I just wanted to see where you were from sort of an integration perspective?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Matthew Rosen</span></strong></p>
<p>Great question. I would say that overall the integration has been completed. I mean, there is obviously a few minor things that you are always dealing with, but at a high-level, the integrations have been completed.</p>
<p>Broadvox, as most people on the phone are aware, was a very complicated migration and integration, but that was completed and it was completed in a very, very fast timeframe. Within a nine months period time we migrated over thousands of customers on to our own network, integrated the people and obviously achieved the synergies that we have mapped out to achieve.</p>
<p>As you look at some of the initiatives that we have moving forward is that from a networking standpoint, I think we've done a really, really good job of expanding and upgrading the existing network infrastructure that we have. And we're always looking at the internal back office systems and how they are geared to support us today and moving forward.</p>
<p>So in light of that, we obviously -- and again, as we've mentioned in the past that the billing system is one that we had identified about a year ago that we were going to replace. We are a quarter or two away from full implementation of that billing system, which will give us a much more streamlined billing system internally, as well as provide us a host of new information in analytics to help us drive more efficiencies in the business and customer acquisition.</p>
<p>The other two areas that we're looking at from an OSS standpoint is really improving the operational support system. We have a good and functional one today. But Kevin, as you know, we're looking to build very large business here, so we want to make sure that the OSS system we have is capable of supporting us not only today, but our organic and d inorganic growth, so we are looking at options to potentially replace or supplement our existing OSS system.</p>
<p>And then lastly, on the CRM side, we were implementing Salesforce.com. We have integrated to a number of our systems. We're continuing to integrate it to some other systems, but right now we've chosen and implemented the Salesforce.com as our CRM solution.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And we have no further questions at this time. This now concludes the question-and-answer session. And now I would like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks.</p>
<p>End of Q&amp;A</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Rosen</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Frank. And thanks to everyone who participated in the call today. We appreciate the support of the shareholders and a dedication of our team at Fusion.
