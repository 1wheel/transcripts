<p>Good morning everybody and thanks for joining us for our 2015 half year results. Our financial headlines and business achievements for the first half of year are available in our ASX announcement and our half year results briefing slide pack, both provide the detail behind the headlines today. We also issued our half year report in the market earlier today. Following the usual format, I’ll make some opening remarks before we open up the call to Q&amp;A, we’ll try and focus on the Q&amp;A session today.</p>
<p>And as usual, joining me this morning is our Chief Financial Officer Lawrie Tremaine. I can start us of by turning to slide 3, opening up with our key achievements and financial headlines. You can see that we achieved some significant milestones during the first half of 2015. As you’re all aware the period posted some real challenges for the industry as the lower oil prices prevailed through the period coming off highs in the middle of 2014 to some numbers that we’ve not seen for some period of time. Pleasingly, Woodside was able to continue to deliver and we’ve delivered on all of our operating and investment commitments during the half.</p>
<p>We entered the front-end engineering and design phase for the Browse FLNG Development, an important step for us towards developing the world-class Browse resource and we were able to take advantage of the lower cost environment and accelerate the greater infield development which is important for us, it’s been in development, it’s been around for a number of years. With the addition of Wheatstone, Balnaves and Kitimat to our portfolio, our proved plus probable reserves increased by just on 19.5% and our best estimate Contingent resources increased by more than 150%.</p>
<p>We also had a gas discovery, Pyxis-1 which has future tieback potential to Pluto and this adds an additional net 2C Contingent resources of around 68 million barrels for Pluto. Significantly though through the first half, we were able to maintain a strong financial position in order to fund our development and growth activities. We are in the market, and we’ve refinanced $3.75 billion of debt at very competitive rates and we’ve decreased our pre-tax portfolio cost of debt to just under 2.6% per annum.</p>
<p>Our key financial results are on slide four. Lawrie will provide more detail, but I want to briefly talk about the headlines. Our reported net profit after tax was $679 million consistent with market consensus and reflecting the impact of the falling commodity prices over the past year. This was underpinned by a production 42 million barrels and operating revenue of $2.55 billion for the period.</p>
<p>Our reported earnings were $0.83 per share reflecting our operating revenue result. I think it is important to note that our interim dividend of $0 .66 per share is a strong return in today's environment and reflects our continued commitment to an 80% dividend payout ratio. We were able to do this because we have a resilient business model which we believe is well-positioned to capitalize on the oil price uncertainty in front of us.</p>
<p>This brings me to slide five. Our view is that the oil market is going to remain structurally oversupplied for some time. However, we are seeing worldwide oil demand growth. We saw some 1.4 million barrels of growth per day occurring in 2015, which is around double the growth we saw last year. So the oil market is rebalancing but it is going to take some time to rebalance completely.</p>
<p>As you can see from our half year results, we have strong cash flows and we have been very active in accelerating our cost reduction initiatives. Our continuing challenge to cost structures and our drive to improve efficiency and reliability across our business very make underpins our achievements. And I want to single out a couple or in particular, a highlight for the first half was the completion of a major turnaround at our Pluto LNG plant. This was the first major turnaround for this plant since its start up and we were able to complete that 10 days ahead of schedule along with making significant gains in the rest of our business through our productivity program. And we're still targeting $800 million in enduring benefits to be delivered to the bottom line by the end of 2016.</p>
<p>Looking ahead, our existing LNG contracts will continue to provide a solid basis for revenue. Our shop balance sheet and ongoing reliability means we are well positioned to provide both yield and growth. And of course in all of this, our commitment to health and safety remains steadfast as you can see from the charts.</p>
<p>I will now pass over to Lawrie Tremaine. Lawrie is going to discuss the financial results and I'll come back and close at the end.</p>
<p><strong>Lawrie Tremaine</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Peter, and good morning everyone. Starting with profit on slide eight, it should be no surprise to anyone on this call that our profit in the first half has declined with lower oil prices and to a lesser extent the plant turnaround at Pluto. Partially offsetting these hits to profit, we have achieved net cost reductions of $163 million and lower PRRT and income tax in line with lower pre-tax profits. The cost reductions come from a range of sources including lower royalty and excise due to reduced prices and the rapidly growing impact of our cost reduction efforts.</p>
<p>We provide a context file for our first half results by comparing our profit and cash flow per barrel with those of our oil and gas peer group who have already reported half-year results today. This comparison is shown on slide nine. Only 3 of the 10 peers have posted a first half profit. We are also well positioned on a cash flow basis noting that this chart doesn't reflect the higher sustaining capital burden of many of our peers.</p>
<p>Moving to slide 10, our first half production was a good outcome, especially considering the impact of cyclones and unplanned outage at the North West Shelf gas plant. The cyclone which resulted in the Atwood Osprey drill rig breaking its moving and drifting near to the Pluto flow lines is a major component of the 2.9 million barrels of oil equivalent shown in the chart. On the positive side, our production team maintained higher liability in the LNG and oil facilities and the major Pluto turnaround was completed 10 days or 30% ahead of the original schedule.</p>
<p>With that, we are maintaining our 2015 full year production guidance range of 86 million to 94 million barrels of oil equivalent. You can see on slide 11 that the decline in LNG pricing has not been as large as the fall in the Brent oil price, particularly at Pluto. There are a couple of reasons to this. The JCC lags changes in the Brent oil price and the full half year impact of the Pluto price review.</p>
<p>On slide 12, you can start to see a downward production cost trend in both oil and gas, the latter after adjusting for the additional costs associated with the Pluto turnaround. The impact of our cost reduction efforts are building and will become more apparent over time. In our results today, the cost reductions have been partly masked by the investments we are making to achieve the savings.</p>
<p>At our Investor Day briefing in May last year, we announced our productivity program. Slide 13 shows you our focus areas and a few examples of how we’re tracking against them. Our full year investment expenditure guidance on slide 14 is materially unchanged from what we presented to you in the Investor Day back in May. And next, I like to recognize the work done by our treasury team to refinance that debt portfolio. As Peter said earlier, we’ve raised $3.75 billion in debt so far this year. We’ve pushed out our average term to maturity to well over four years and we’ve done this at historically low interest rates resulting in a current portfolio cost of debt of just 2.6%.</p>
<p>Finally, we’ve maintained our 80% dividend payout, providing an interim dividend of U.S. $0.66 per share. Whilst in U.S. dollar terms, the dividend is 40% lower than the 2014 interim, the decrease in the Australian dollar dividend will likely be much smaller, depending on the final exchange rate.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll hand you back to Peter.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Coleman</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Lawrie. I want to close out this part of the call by giving you an update on our global exploration and development activities. As you can see on slide 18, we worked hard this year to progress the Browse FLNG development. As I mentioned earlier, we announced entry into the front end engineering and design phase of the development during the first half. I’m also pleased to let you know that the primary approvals have significantly progressed as well and on Monday of this week, we received Commonwealth environmental approval. This is a significant milestone and concludes the 20 month environmental impact assessment process and it means that we now have all primary environmental approvals for Browse in place.</p>
<p>Moving forward, we’ll continue to pursue cost efficiencies on the project as we work towards a final investment decision in the second half of 2016. For Wheatstone, the Woodside operated Julimar/Brunello project is 65% complete and is targeting ready for start-up in the second half of 2016 and then work also continues with Chevron on the appraisal of the Liard Basin in Canada to underpin the Kitimat LNG development. So, a lot of work underway in the development part of that business.</p>
<p>Now, global exploration program. Our emphasis is really transitioning from capturing growth opportunities to execution. We undertook a number of seismic studies during the first half and we’re praising these studies with a view to building out drill-ready inventory unless we’ve been out to enjoy a much lower day rate for our seismic vessel cost during this period. We have an exciting drilling program underway in the second half, the Cheetah-1 well offshore Cameroon, which spudded on the 3rd of July with results expected later this quarter and further wells are planned for offshore Korea in Q3 and offshore Myanmar in the fourth quarter of this year.</p>
<p>So, to sum it up, our global development and exploration activities are progressing well and to our plan. As I mentioned, our operating revenue is down for the same period as last year, simply reflecting the lower oil price environment, but we have transformed our business and we’re well positioned for the future we believe. We’ll continue to focus on disciplined capital management. No change there, underpinned by strong safety performance and operational excellence. In the second half of 2015, you can expect to see progress on Browse FLNG, including progress on driving down cost to enable a final investment decision next year and you will also see progress on the Julimar project and the three high impact exploration wells that I mentioned in Cameroon, Korea, and Myanmar.</p>
<p>And so, on that positive note, I’ll finish up and I’ll open up to questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from Mr. Mark Samter from Credit Suisse. Please ask your question Mark.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Samter</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning guys. I’m just kind of wondering, if I could the question, you highlighted how much your cost of debt has dropped, we’re in a world at the moment where there is the haves and haves not in terms of balance sheets and what do you call that as your funding source, but domestically here but certainly internationally we’re seeing guys where and maybe debt markets are closing up to the incremental costs of capital is either equity or it’s selling assets, we can see what’s happened to listed asset prices. Can you give us a feel if you’re starting to see more distress at the asset levels from some of these companies that do need capital rather rapidly or do you think we’re still not hit the point where unlisted assets are at attractive prices?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lawrie Tremaine</span></strong></p>
<p>Look Mark, I’m going to just start by talking about the capital markets that we’ve participated in first and then I’ll make some comments about the -- as it applies to other businesses and other assets and Peter will probably chime in as well at that point. So firstly, obviously we’ve raised $3.75 billion, and so the capital markets have been opened to us, and I always take the opportunity to thank the markets that support us, we’ve been very well supported in both the bond market and the bank market both in Australia and also in our region. So some of the support came from Asian banks. The support has been strong and has enabled us to go through that refinancing activity and come out with a great result in term of terms interest rate. But of course, as I noted in the presentation in my comments, we’ve also pushed out our average period to maturity which is great and basically, we’ve taken advantage of this good environment.</p>
<p>As it relates to others, we only have a narrow window into the situation for others, I have seen reports that some of the capital that -- there was a wall of capital being provided to oil and gas players around the world but particularly in the later part of 2014, we saw a number of debt issuances in particular at that time, we saw equity issuance in the first part of this year but anecdotally it looks like it’s starting to dry up particularly at the poor quality end of the industry. And so, with that but it is anecdotal but with that I’ll pass over Peter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah Mark, let me address asset part of it. With respect to asset sales, potential asset sales or potential M&amp;A activity between companies. I’m guessing that we’re hitting. We’ve always had a belief that it would take a consistent period of two to three quarters of low oil prices for companies to start to really focus on assets that would be of interest to other players in the market in a low price environment. And what does that mean, it simply says, when you’re in low prices, as you saw in Lawrie’s chart, not many companies are generating enough free cash after their investment requirements to actually go out and acquire anything.</p>
<p>So it becomes a bit of a chicken and egg in that you’d all love to grab and acquire asset but the willing buyer, willing seller scenario is that they’re actually aren’t that many buyers in the traditional market that had enough free cash to go and make asset acquisitions. And if they would do so, they will typically go after the higher quality assets, which as you know are the assets that are often underpinning the strength of balance sheets of companies that are distressed. So it’s one of those things that people aren’t going to let go of high-quality assets until they feel like there is not may other choices left to them.</p>
<p>And then the market may actually not be there for buyers to go and pay cash for those assets. And as Lawrie mentioned, some of the early asset sales we saw particularly in North America early this year were actually done on the back of equity issuances, which was reasonably unusual for that market at that time. And then some of the larger transactions of late have been based on script or script which is again some hedge on commodity prices coming into that, but it’s also people being able to use their stock rather than having to dip into cash and debt.</p>
<p>So what does all that mean? It’s actually really difficult to sell an asset in today's environment. It’s equally difficult to buy one, because the sellers are distressed to the point where they are willing to sell an asset for what we believe the current market would see as a reasonable price for those particular assets. So I think we’ve got another quarter in front of us before we really start to see any significant number of asset sales coming to the market. And then comes the challenge, there will be some who move early and we will soak up the available capacity in the market to purchase and those who hold too long will be left standing with their asset in my view and may need to sell those assets to non-traditional buyers or non-traditional buyers in the marketplace.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Samter</span></strong></p>
<p>So it sounds, effectively you are not really seeing any meaningful narrowing of the bid offer spread at the moment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>I think the offer spread, the offers is still at a long term oil price basis and the reality is, as you know, we’ve got pay for it based on today's pricing or at least today's five year strips, because that is the environment, which we’ve got to monetize these assets. So that will close there over time I believe, but we've got another quarter of this to get through. And that is simply because there is going to be some choppiness in commodity pricing and so you will see some false positives and we saw that during the second quarter where WTI bumped up around $60 and as soon as you give that group any oxygen, they feed of it really quickly and today we are below $50, so they are in this kind of malaise of they are not feeling happy about themselves, but give them a sniff of $60 and they will be back there again. So, we will see this oscillation in the market we believe through – a good way through next year potentially through the end of next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Samter</span></strong></p>
<p>I might just pinch one more question quickly if I can. Just on the – to get your grasping on the spot energy market and there was this lot of commissioning cargoes that is going to come out of the various transits that ramp up on the east and west coast of Australia, but it also appears that destination restrictions being lifted on couple of the east coast projects and therefore could put further pressure on the spot market in the coming couple of years. Just to get a view of how you guys are seeing the spot market for the next couple of years.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, look, we're fortunate because we don't have a huge exposure to the spot market at the moment. We got in early. You might recall back in late 2013, early 2014 we announced to the market that we had actually entered into some mid-term contracts with a couple of buyers and at that point we could see that there was going to – one of the reasons for those we could see that there was going to be some uncertainty with lot of new projects coming online. So we simply want to lock in some pricing and we had some put options around some of those cargoes and we’ve exercised those put options, meaning replace them to buyers even though buyers may have had cheaper alternative if they had gone to market.</p>
<p>We do have some spot in the first half of this year. That is a little higher than we had originally planned, but the reason for that is simply Pluto turnaround was lot shorter than we planned. And so we ended up with some more spot cargoes and then the unplanned outages around the cyclone events and the substation fire at the Northwest Shelf Coast to getting to the spot market, but they are unusual events and we actually see our exposure to spot being much more than that as we go out over the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>Having said that, what do you expect in the spot market? There is plenty of shipping. What we're seeing is that the cross rates for shipping, if you look at the current shipping rates, they are really at historic lows. We're not seeing cargoes come out of – come into Asia from the Middle East. They are going into Europe now, because the pricing differential doesn't justify it. So we don't see a lot of assistance coming from the market to increase spot prices over the next 18 months, so I would expect a similar sort of oil pricing environment over the next 18 months. And again those who know how to market, those who have control over the shipping, we believe will be advantaged in that market, those who don’t have control over the shipping are going to have to be quick on their feet I think to get the cargo as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark Samter</span></strong></p>
<p>Great one, thanks a lot guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Mark.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And your next question comes from Mr. Kirit Hira from Macquarie. Mr. Kirit Hira, please ask your question. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kirit Hira</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning guys. Listen, just a question on the -- I guess the cost efficiencies targeted, it does seem like you’re delivering on those cost initiatives, fairly practically this year in terms of what’s being targeted. Just wondering is there any possibility that you might look to extend effectively the $800 million target of recurring benefits, just given we find ourselves in probably weaker oil price environment than many anticipated?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lawrie Tremaine</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Kirit. Look, the $800 million – we always described that there is $800 million in benefits, because it’s a mix of cost reduction and volume increases. Bear in mind, its start of life is the productivity program. Obviously, the target to hit the $800 million has become more difficult because if you value the increased production at $50, that’s a nice value than you value it at $100 where we started. So the target is more difficult today in that regard, equally there is probably more tailwinds helping us from a cost reduction point of view. But on balance, we decided to not change the target, and I assume you can understand that reasoning. What I will say though, and Peter mentioned it, he talked about having accelerated the cost reduction program and there has been a building effort and I can tell you now that hundreds of people across Woodside that have added cost reduction and improvement to their job descriptions over the last year that perhaps weren’t there previously. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Kirit, I would add to that and say we have been on the stations here recently about do we extend the program, do we make the target volumes, we have actually concluded that -- might be the best thing to do is to close out the program when we originally set it, which is 2016, but make sure that it becomes sustainable and embedded in the organization. I think that’s the key differentiator that we are looking for. These are not short-term cost reductions; these are not deferrals with projects where people are taking and capital that I will have to spend at some point in the future. I want to make sure you’re going to continue to see this in bottom line.</p>
<p>Again, we always get asked these on those programs, well, showed me the money. I would suggest to you, if you have a look at our reliability numbers, well that’s improved from you can see the production coming through. And then equally and probably the best indicator for this on an industry basis is the unit operating costs, and on page 12, [indiscernible] you can see opening significant inroads to our unit operating costs and that’s not Forex driven, so we get a little bit of Forex help this year, but it’s not all Forex driven at all.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kirit Hira</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just a question Pyxis, 400 Bcf, yet it’s only the impact is resolved, obviously a more difficult tieback and also I presumably backfill gas. What’s impacting the -- I guess the technical constraints there. I understand the commercial headwinds, but just curious to understand what I guess the technical constraints are?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I am glad you asked the question because there are no technical constraints, it’s actually quite a straight-forward tieback, so there is not technical complexity with respect to reservoir for the development itself, so it’s pretty straight-forward subsea tieback. The reason we have booked it at this point as a continued resource is just simply the maturity of that reserve’s booking process. And so we just need to do a little before work on the sub-surface to move that forward and also we need to some more work on firming up the development and the field development plant for that. The [indiscernible] security of our assessment and development process, it’s got nothing to do with the complexity of the development or the cost structure of the development.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kirit Hira</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just one question I can squeeze in for Lawrie. The cash tax has been quite high this half, is there anything there that’s driving that? It’s been quite high versus previous half?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lawrie Tremaine</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it’s just taxes that need to be paid on 2014 profits. So it’s just the carryover from -- into our payments in ’15.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kirit Hira</span></strong></p>
<p>And presumably that’s on higher oil prices obviously, so that could be quite high, okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lawrie Tremaine</span></strong></p>
<p>All right, yeah.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kirit Hira</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And your next question comes from Mr. Dale Koenders from Citigroup. Mr. Dale please ask you question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dale Koenders</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning gentlemen. Firstly just on the Browse project, I guess you’ve spoken about a target to cost out previously 20% plus and I know a lot of the majors are talking about higher costs given sustaining oil prices or sorry higher cost out. Obviously, I understand other JV partners have already signed MOUs for their share of volumes in the project and you’re looking do something in the second half. Can you sort of provide some comments in terms of closing that gap between realized LNG price and oil price outlook and what that [indiscernible] for sort of an investment case for an IRR, obviously spoken about 12% to 15% range previously and Peter you mentioned about, also one of the prior questions in investment cases are $60 barrel oil is that the hurdle, $60 a barrel or 12% IRR?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>All right, well you’re trying to locking into another doubt well done. What you’ve quoted back to us is certainly some of the guidance we’ve indicated to the market is the scenarios that we certainly consider. But let me give you an update on the cost if I can, then I’ll come back to the marketing and then we’ll close on the investment case. Just on the cost side, we’ve indicated previously, we’re seeing cost reductions in the upstream part of the project in the order of 20% plus and some of those are up at 30%. So we’re seeing the range that we need of cost reductions starting to flow through to the upstream part of the project and the upstream is the drilling subsea flow lines that serve part of the things that Woodside will be directly responsible for with respect to the development part of it.</p>
<p>And if you may recall, the cost structure of the project is that the investment requires about 50% of the investment goes into the upstream and about 50% of it goes into the processing facilities in the vessel. So, on 50% of the investment case we’re seeing strong indications of cost reductions hitting the target ranges that we’re looking for. On the downstream part of it, we’ve still got work to do, and we needed to get into the FEED part of the project to really be able to knuckle down on that work and firm up just what we can do with respect to the construction cost in the yard in Korea and getting efficiencies in the build of the vessel. And we can do that because Woodside is now motivated on some of the contracts that were between TechNet and Samsung, we were able to get in there and directly work with the project team on getting those cost targets down.</p>
<p>What I can tell you is at the top of the house, across all of the joint ventures where hopefully aligned is what we need to do to get the project going. So there is no doubt in that regard. So you’ll hear more progress on that as we go through the year but it’s still early, we have some numbers in mind and we’re working on that very, very hard. With respect to the timing of development and so forth, the good news is, we’re still targeting, as we said, second half of next year for an FID and that will line up nicely with completion of activities in the yards, so our privilege will be out of the yard or around the same time that we’re going to FID so that’s good news for us in that regard and that was maybe one of key things for us in trying to derisk this project.</p>
<p>With respect to marketing, one of the keys to marketing given that we’re developing as a portfolio player is to actually get a real project and in today’s environment, buyers are reluctant to enter into meaningful conversations unless you’ve got in their mind a real project for them to consider. Now that Browse has gone into FEED, we have a real project, and so the buyer interest now has obviously gone up quite significantly and we’ll be aggressively marketing Browse through the second half of this year, so we expect to be able to give you an update on that towards the end of this year or early next year. That’s the key to that.</p>
<p>I can tell you, we've got some choices that we need to make with respect to how much volume we place in the market, what the phasing of the volume needs to be and then the diversity of the buy group that we want and we've got strategies all around that. </p>
<p>So I think we are well progressed with respect to the buying in our strategies, but we’ve got some other things that we need to do and of course as you know, we’re targeting opening up of other markets as well as our traditional buyers and our focus is on our traditional buyers at this point.</p>
<p>The investment case, it's always one where we’re likely to be making a decision on the investment at a point in time when the oil price is not reflecting our long-term view of oil pricing and we've been very clear with our project teams and our partners in this regard, is that the project will need to deliver an acceptable return at the current expectations of oil pricing, meaning, it needs to break even at the sorts of low oil prices that we’re seeing in the marketplace today.</p>
<p>That's a breakeven, that's not a 12% return, that's a breakeven. With the kind of low returns we talked about – low range of DCF returns, 12% to 15%, that needs to be delivered at our long-term forecast.</p>
<p>So if you think about it, the investment decision would be made with two considerations, one is what's our expectation of long-term oil pricing and does that meet our investment criteria and then equally in a world where oil prices never recover, can we assure ourselves that in fact the investment will breakeven at those sorts of prices. And I think that’s pretty harsh test, but we are</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dale Koenders</span></strong></p>
<p>Is breakeven cash breakeven or cost of capital?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>It will be a WAC [ph] breakeven, it will be WAC plus, when you put some margin in there. So probably not too much different to the numbers you guys run on apples, given though WAC is lower than that though. So each investor will have those sorts of – sorry, each partner will have to run -- we run a joint venture set of books on this and we’ll be running as each joint venture will make their own choices.</p>
<p>So that is the change Dale in the investment test, but I think it's an appropriate one given that we don't want to get caught like our industry has, historically embedding on the future is always going to be better than today. We need to assure ourselves that we can manage this breakeven, phase the spending and manage the cost and price expectations appropriately.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dale Koenders</span></strong></p>
<p>Given the movement into FEED, is it fair to assume that there is a level of confidence that early indications on cost out and LNG pricing would support that sort of investment decision?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we didn't move into FEED on a hope and a prayer. We’ve moved in to FEED with the belief that we’ll get the project across the line, but we also -- and know dilution that there is some more work to do and as I said, the majority of that work to do is on the cost structure of the downstream project.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dale Koenders</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then just one quick question on Wheatstone, you’ve mentioned that forecast expenditure is unchanged from the purchase economics that is different of saying that it’s on schedule and on budget. The operator has been talking about challenges with the [indiscernible] and a shift of work from Malaysia or Indonesia and a possible sliding trend to timing, can you provide a little bit more sort of certainty on your view of cost on that project and schedule?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, you’re quite right to say our investment case had some contingency in that, really simply based on the knowledge that we had at the time of the acquisition. We’ll be providing firmer guidance on this later in the year as the operator updates their final numbers. So I wouldn't want to get out there and get ahead of the operator in that regard.</p>
<p>But I think it's fair to say the operator gave some guidance in the recent past that they’re still targeting an into 2016 start-up, but recognized the challenges that if there is any slippage from that, I think it'll be nominal to be honest with you Dale, that’s our assessment of where it is and our investment crisis is still robust in that regard. So, we’ve -- we recognize the uncertainty of these projects in the investment case. The only assurance I can give you is that the current expectations and market guidance is certainly in our investment case is robust with respect to that guidance given by the operator. So Dale, I think we’ve said before in our investment case, we did build in some extra dollars and we did build in some extra time because that’s a prudent basis to invest on and we’re still well within that given the operators’ current guidance though.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dale Koenders</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Very good.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>So in good shape.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Sonali Paul from Reuters. Sonali, please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sonali Paul</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Peter and Lawrie. I just wanted to know in terms of production costs, what are you hoping to achieve by the end of this year in terms of cutting costs?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lawrie Tremaine</span></strong></p>
<p>I think in one of the chart we put in an estimate for the cost reduction for the year. Yeah, it’s on page 13. It’s one I didn’t stop and talk about to a great extent but it is an operating expenditure and capital expenditure reduction forecast if you like in there. What -- but behind those numbers, so there has been a great deal of activity, but the delivering that story to the bottom line takes time. So, for example, if we renegotiate an annual contract today, well, you’re only going to see less than half of that impact in 2015 results. And so, those sorts of things have been going on for the last year or so and so, the cost reductions are building but that’s our best estimate today of impact by year-end.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Sonali, Lawrie also mentioned that you don’t see the full impact of some of the initiatives yet because we’ve actually had to spend money to save money. I hear that a lot with -- in some areas of our business but the -- but we are seeing the savings come through. I think the easier ones that I point to and understand is the staff reductions that we’ve had in the organization this year and those staff reductions come with the cost. The numbers that you are seeing include the cost of those reductions in them.</p>
<p>So, I haven’t given the guys a free pass and said well, the implementation costs are free and then I’ll give you all the credits. No, we’ve made the organization ensure that we focus on the fact that these decisions do have a cost with them and that you need to deliver on the total outcome because investors need to see a bottom line impact and just simply always giving yourself credit for the saving without including the cost component of it is not a fair reflection of the value of the initiative. And so, you’re seeing that come through. So, 2015 has been a lot of initiatives that included additional costs for us to implement. You won’t see the full impact of those initiatives on a net basis until 2016 because of the implementation costs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sonali Paul</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from Mr. Nik Burns from UBS. Mr. Nik Burns, please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nik Burns</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks guys. Look, just a question on your exploration program for 2016. It looks very much first half weighted. I’m just wondering if there is any plans to add to that through the year, in particular I think of your investor briefing early this year, talked about the Fortuna 3D survey over the North West shelf area and that could lead to some exploration drilling sometime next year. That doesn’t seem to be there at this point. I’m just wondering if this plans to add further well to that program.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lawrie Tremaine</span></strong></p>
<p>Nik, we’re drilling -- sorry we’re developing what we call drill-ready inventory. We’re about 50% of the way through that build and really has an internal target for ourselves based on the size of spin that we had. We want to have about 30 wells sitting in that drill-ready inventory. We’re about half way through that. We were hoping that Fortuna survey would deliver some of those wells for the North West shelf. Unfortunately, the interpretation of that survey is being delayed due to some issues we’ve had with the quality of the data and so, that’s just delayed a few months.</p>
<p>We are cleaning out that data and we expect we will get good resolution of that, but that has affected some of the back end of 2016. So we will be looking for additional opportunities there and we are pretty confident we feel the back end of 2016. This is a market where we are going to have to stay very disciplined though that we don't drill wells if we don't need to. And so this program that you have in front of us also reflects our commitment to our drilling rigs.</p>
<p>And the current drilling rig we have drilling exploration in the Deepwater Millennium. The contract for that expires in the first half of next year and we’ve got a decision as to whether we extend that contract or whether we bring in new rig in. So what I would say is this is as much a reflection of the discipline we have in our capital management and that we are showing these things that we have committed to rather than things that we have an opportunity for. So the opportunity space is much greater, but we haven't committed yet to that particular drilling program. So we haven't put it on the chart.</p>
<p>If we do commit to that program, then we expect daily rig rates to be significantly lower than what we are seeing on the current program, because it’s a legacy program. It’s a contract that was entered into some 18 months ago. And so that is a sort of thing we are seeing in the market. I can tell you in the seismic market, I mentioned that during the call, we are seeing rate reductions of about 50% on some of the seismic that we're running in different parts of the world. So we are able to take advantage of the current market conditions in that space.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nik Burns</span></strong></p>
<p>And is Phil Loader still out there looking for more exploration opportunity for you?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Phil is listening to you. Yes, we are and we are focusing in the areas of thematic areas that we have talked about previously, so the Atlantic margin area, sub- Saharan Africa, the Asia area, or the Australasia area for us. We also -- noteworthy that you don't see in exploration is the development drilling or the appraisal drilling that we are doing in the Liard Basin. And so some people might put some of it in there. They are not strictly exploration because of the nature of the resource, so we are drilling two quite significant wells in the Liard basin this year and we will drill another two next year and that’s to prove out that Liard resource. So we are directing our monies across the entirety of our business, so if we don't see what I would call classic exploration in the context of exploration, we are still proving out resources through that appraisal drilling in the Liard.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nik Burns</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just a final one from me. Just on your development pipeline under that chart on slide 21. Looks like Greater Enfield feed is now going through to end of 2016. I think previously that side of the year that was I think you are hoping to end feed in mid-‘16. Just wondering what’s behind any change in scope there or delay in FID?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>There is no delay. It’s in fact we are working hard to accelerate. It is just the position of the graph, meaning the way that we develop the graph, we are not precise enough to call something that may be a few weeks into the second half of the year. So based on rate any slippage into that or any lack of commitment in fact the team has been challenged to accelerate entering of FID. So you may actually -- the target actually is much more aggressive than what you see on this graph.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nik Burns</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And your next question comes from James Paton from Bloomberg News. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">James Paton</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning everyone. I wanted to ask about Sempra LNG and US LNG. Is that progressing according to plan and do you see any opportunity to expand further in the US LNG market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Good question, James. As you know, we signed a MoU with Sempra earlier this year to study the development of an LNG plant at Fort Arthur in Texas on a site that Sempra own. We had an aggressive schedule on that to make a decision as to whether we should move forward on it or not. What I can tell you is, that’s progressing quite well and we’ve entered into a phase now where we’ve agreed to start sharing costs on that project. That is an important milestone that basically says we are starting to form a view that there is a commercial viable development there. And once you get into a cost sharing arrangement that says that you believe there is something there. The work at the moment though is still quite primary but we obviously see a development case there that is an attractive one and it’s attractive enough for us to spend time and efforts through the end of this year to try and firm up.</p>
<p>What’s happening generally in the market there, the normal amount of everybody wants to build an LNG plant and the cost structures are still there and so forth. Look I would say to you and I’ll view the market is about to play out the way we expected, the early plans were developed on the back of the balance sheet of the buyers because the developers themselves didn’t have the balance sheet capacity to fund the plant through [indiscernible] project financing costs were prohibitive if they didn’t have buyers underpinning the contracts.</p>
<p>We’re now seeing a marketplace where the buyers, there are less buyers who have the capacity to underpin those contracts, who are less willing to underpin those contracts. I believe that’s a market where the combination of Woodside and Sempra actually start to differentiate. So in a market where anybody can build a plant, it’s hard to differentiate in a market where balance sheet capacity, confidence of the operators so forth and so on become differentiators, that’s one way Woodside plays very well.</p>
<p>It’s too early for us to say with any confidence that there will be a development there. All I can say is the market conditions are starting to form such that they know Woodside joint venture with an excellent partner like Sempra is starting to become more positive. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and just quickly the follow-up on that. I think you said that you’re expecting spot prices to be similar over the next 18 months, if I heard you correctly. Can you provide any color on what’s happening in the market just with regard to supply and demand, what’s behind your expectation for spot prices at those levels?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Look it’s hard to predict the spot market because it will depend on plant start-ups and who’s in the market at particular points in time and what nuclear does and so forth. But spud will have more volatility naturally based on weather conditions and what buyers need and what -- where sellers are, we’ve been able to predict when volumes come into the market. So my view is that we’ll trade in a range that you’ve been seeing for the last six months or so and I just wouldn’t plan for anything different today, if it’s better than that, it’s fantastic, it’s difficult to see sustained periods that are lower than that.</p>
<p>Having said that, as I mentioned during the call, we believe if you control you’re shipping, you would be advantaged in that market. If you’re selling it, I think it’s going to be more difficult because you now rely on the buyer with respect to getting the shipping to you. So, all I would say is just the market is oversupplied during this period with respect to spot, we always thought that would be the case that was always our view, we think it’s a short to medium term issue that we’ll get work through as new projects come into play.</p>
<p>So, all we’re seeing is what we expected would happen, these things are always, when you are standing in the middle of storm it’s a lot different with them when you’re looking at it coming at you, at the moment, we’re in the middle of the storm, it will pass and those who have prepared themselves for it will weather it particularly well, those who haven’t, I can’t predict what that would look like.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks James.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And your next question comes from Mr. Stuart Baker from Morgan Stanley. Please ask your question. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stuart Baker</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning gentlemen, just a couple of things given quite a few questions being asked already. If I can just get a little update on timelines around the Liard Basin testing program, I understand the wells are being drilled and completed and the testing is to be able to take in this half year. I’m just wondering whether or not when we should expect to see some results from those wells. That’s the first question.</p>
<p>The second question is regarding, we’re at regarding third-party processing and tolling for the Northwest Shelf and whether other parties are more or less likely to develop their fields in the current environment to enable you to get some gas into those plants plus 2020.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Stu, let me give you some context to the decisions that we'll be making on Kitimat and then I'll ask Mike Utsler, our Chief Operating Officer to just give a little color around the wells and then I'll come back to the North West Shelf. </p>
<p>With respect to Kitimat, the decision process for us remains the same, which is really focus on improving the resource in the Liard basin and gaining confidence that we can deliver on a caste structure for the development of those wells that enable us to make an investment decision and of course as you know very well, in US unconventional shale, which is what the Liard basin is, it's a manufacturing process and you have to be able to convince yourself and get confidence that you can drive your cost structure down over time and take advantage of that manufacturing process. So we’re at the very early days of drilling wells in Liard.</p>
<p>So from my cost point of view, we've been working with the operator on understanding how we’re going to drive down cost and we expect over the next 12 to 18 months, we’ll see some excellent progress there.</p>
<p>The second part then was just the productivity of the wells. With some vertical files that have been drilled, we’ll now be drilling some horizontal wells and we just want to test the productivity of the wells and that will have over the next 18 months and Mike will give you some more color around that.</p>
<p>The second part of the decision process for the Kitimat project was around midstream and downstream cost structure and we've been working again with the operator -- with our joint-venture partner there to ensure that we bring all the Woodside’s knowledge with respect to execution of LNG plant construction techniques and so forth to that.</p>
<p>It’s early in that process, but we expect by the end of this year or early next year, we’ll have a better feel for that and of course the pace of spend that we’ll have on the project has slowed to reflect the process we’re going through here to reduce the cost structure. So we don't want to be spending ahead our headlines on the project. We’ve worked with Chevron to ensure that the pace of spend reflects the decision process we’re going through.</p>
<p>So I'll let Mike give you a bit more color around the wells and then I'll come back and talk about the North West Shelf.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stuart Baker</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Utsler</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, Stuart. Regarding Liard drilling efforts, currently, the two critical deep horizontal tests of the Liard reserve have progressed to the point at which the wells are now drilled and we’re staging for the completions phase of that, which will require fracturing of the horizontal sections, both of those wells should be worked towards completion of the fracking stages in October and November to then be flow tested in November and December of this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stuart Baker</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Just on the third-party through the North West Shelf, Stu, look, it’s taken many years for the North West Shelf to get its mine around -- tidy access to the facilities. We have an aligned view of that now, which has been an important step. We also have an aligned view of the appropriate tolling structure for third parties accessing the North West Shelf.</p>
<p>We've seen the first indications of that with the LOI that was signed with Hess for their development. I can tell you the discussions around that to commercial activities -- around the Hess opportunity progressing per plan and we’ll have some decision points here over the next 12 months, although the ball is mainly in Hess’ court in this regard with respect to that. So I'd just say that’s on plan and that’s still moving through.</p>
<p>With respect to other third-party access, we have approached other third parties that we know have discovered undeveloped resources. We've been discussing with them similar tolling structures and we've been sharing some of those structures with them. We’re waiting on their response to that. So I’d say the North West Shelf is doing what you would expect the North West Shelf joint venture to do, which is to maximize the life value of that asset and I'm pleased with where we are today, but I haven't landed anything in. So I can't tell you I’ve landed anything, but we’re in the right place.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stuart Baker</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And your final question comes from Mr. John Hirjee from Deutsche Bank. Mr. John Hirjee, please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Hirjee</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good morning, everyone. Question, Peter, on the Pluto turnaround costs. Were they budgeted as per your requirements or did you feel that the costs seem to be a little bit high in terms of this particular turnaround?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>John, this was always going to be an expensive turnaround for us, because we basically had to get into the majority of the vessels in the plant under the integrity insurance requirements for a brand new plant, be able to get and set a baseline for the vessel, and so we had a baseline on startup and the first turnaround, the major turnaround you hit the plant very hard and you basically open as much as you can, that then establishes the baseline for you. We expect the net baseline then gives you the basis upon which you can forecast future inspection requirements. </p>
<p>I can tell you that the plant was in excellent shape, and so we were very pleased in that regard. The actual turnaround came in significantly under budget for us, so the guys were able to execute the turnaround not only in a shorter time period, but significantly under budget with respect to using technology and techniques in the plant, so it simply wasn’t time driven, but that was technology driven. </p>
<p>And probably the biggest headline for us is, we did do some things to improve the capacity of the plant. We haven’t had enough run time yet to give guidance to the market on what those capacity increases can be expected to be in the future, but the early indications are positive in that regard. And then on the reliability side, one of the key things for us is we – when we started up, we were running some of our compression equipment at higher firing temperatures than industry had a lot experience with. The good news and that was – the good news is the inspections have given us some confidence now that we may be able to having [ph] the next inspection period from around 3.5 years out to 4.5 years, but it’s too early for us to commit to that year. So that’s the way we are targeting. So I would say, touch what everything out that turnaround was positive for us, both on what we found when we went into the vessels, what we found it with respect to our ability to execute the program and then of course, what we found with respect to the period in which we are able to then extend the next turnaround. </p>
<p>So all positive indicators, and then also a little bit of a capacity increase. But give us a few months’ run time with the plant. I don’t want to over promise on these things too early. We will make sure that we can deliver it to you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Hirjee</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. A question on the data now you give on flared gas intensity, what sort of baseline are you thinking that you want to get that down to, given I see the trend is down, but what are you trying to get to in terms of that particular metric? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>I can’t but I know the metric, we have got some numbers that run way below the first quartile in this area, so between 8 to 10 tonnes per kilo tonne. There are sorts of internal targets we run in the business, so that’s what we want to drive that to. One of the key components on flared gas intensity, as you know that was reliability, so the best way to get flared gas intensity down is to make a plant more reliable, mentioned not having flaring advance and process shutdown. So what I can assure you, this also reflects we bought on some new assets and the assets mix and we are working to improve the performance of the new assets as well. </p>
<p>So that’s where we are. We are not driven by an intensity number per se, it’s something that’s important to us, because that’s a reflection of how well we are running our business and we are driving towards world-class performance on reliability, which has a direct correlation to intensity.</p>
<p>I would add, the numbers you are seeing for the first half include Balnaves coming into it and of course that had a upward impact on those numbers, so I think that would be much better once you’re seeing it, we look forward to Balnaves [indiscernible] and the team is working very hard at the moment on giving the reliability on those to a level that is consistent with our other Woodside assets. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Hirjee</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. And finally, if I may, question on the broader LNG, look you mentioned that you’re in marketing or about to start marketing Browse immediately, what’s -- what are the customers saying to you in terms of the uncertainty with regards to their demands and how they think they can think about contracting at this point in the market given as you’ve seen with Japan recent restart of the nuclear reactor, seemingly much more reliant on nuclear and coal in Korea, those sort of dynamics and how they’re playing into sort of the demand outlook for when you’re trying to contract some volumes in the short-term?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, well, look, we look at the market in two ways. We look at absolute growth in the market and I’m not saying I’ve always look at those numbers with the deal of escapism and the reason for that is when you look at the overall LNG numbers on a global basis that based on an assumption firstly of how much energy is going to be required globally and in totality and then the percentage of that energy that will go into gas and more particular LNG. So, there is some -- don’t get too caught up on an absolute number of port LNG because there is some other overwriting assumptions in the first instance and I believe that LNG needs to earn its place in the energy mix. It’s not naturally that LNG will take a place, it needs to earn its place in that energy mix.</p>
<p>So, we look at that with that eye. So, please don’t go away and we think the world’s always rosy. The second part of that though and the thing that gives us more confidence is where we differentiate ourselves as a supplier into that marketplace and how we will differentiate. We actually think some of the M&amp;A activities that are occurring will actually benefit Woodside with respect to our differentiation as a supplier into that marketplace. The second part we look at John is very simply recontracting and if you look at recontracting volumes, notwithstanding if you’re showing no growth in Japan, Japan will recontract some 60% of its existing supply between now and 2020.</p>
<p>And so, we look at it and say, as a buyer, do you want to recontract with an old plan that might have a limited life or do you -- if you have to pay price x or if you’re going to pay that same price for a brand new plant that you constrain more supply into the market. And we keep telling our people, think like a buyer, think like a buyer, if you are a buyer, you want more supply. You want to underpin new projects coming into the marketplace but they have to be competitive with the existing price structure. So, those who can get volumes into the market at a competitive with existing project I believe will always have a place in the market and that will either be in the growth element or will be in the recontracting element.</p>
<p>And so, that’s kind of where we’re targeting. We’re looking at both and saying there is a mix here. There may be some existing that we can replace and also might be some new growth that we’re getting to. We’re having those conversations with buyers now. Too early for me to give you a lot of indications because you travel to Asia as we do and a lot of the buyers -- it’s a buyers’ market. Let’s be fair, we have to differentiate in a period where there is a buyers’ market and we’re under no dilution in that regard. The world does not owe us a living. We must go and like our way in the world, we must make a place in the world. And in this instance, we’re going to have to work a little harder than we were three or four years ago.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Hirjee</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much, Peter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Peter Coleman</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, John.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. That is all the questions for today. And Mr. Peter Coleman, please continue with any closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Peter Coleman</strong></p>
<p>Thanks everybody, thanks again for the interest in Woodside. Thanks for the depth and breadth of the questions that we’ve had. I hope you enjoyed the format, where you’re able to ask Q&amp;A with a bit of an introduction at the front. As I mentioned in the overview, Woodside has a business plan and a strategy that we believe is a robust one. We’ve introduced some new words into our vocabulary. We are a resilient organization today. We believe our business model is a resilient model and we believe the last six to 12 months has demonstrated the resilience of that model both in a delivery of our operating performance in the place of some external challenges but from a pricing point of view, from a market point of view and also we’ve had some environmental challenges coming through and we’ve demonstrated an excellent resilience.</p>
<p>I think our production resilience is coming through. Our focus on cost initiatives and restructuring our business is starting to come through and at the same time, our people have been through some significant challenges this year.</p>
<p>As we’ve made our organization smaller, we’ve asked them to take on more responsibilities and we’ve also asked them to share in some of the cost reductions that we’ve had to make in the industry and we shared that together. The organization is pulling together on that. With all of that we still have a commitment to growing and refreshing our organization. We are still recruiting graduates at a very high rate. That’s our long term commitment to the business. So I think as you look at Woodside and the things we do and the way we go about our business, we are sensitive to the environment in which we are in. We are sensitive to the needs of our investors.</p>
<p>We have a robust business model, but in no way do we believe that the world will always deliver something for us. We do reflect the changes in the industry. We try to be nimble in our approach. We make consistent decisions based on a consistent set of value and we stay disciplined in that regard. Our focus has been and always will be to make the very best returns that we can for our shareholders, but they will be consistent returns and we will maintain our discipline in the face of often some competing and confusing indicators out there in the marketplace. You can be assured that we are working our hardest to do the very best for our shareholders. Again, I thank you for your interest in Woodside and I look forward to talking with a number of you over the next days and weeks. Thanks very much.</p>
