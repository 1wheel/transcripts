<p>It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Philip Sassower, Chairman and CEO for Xplore.</p>
<p><strong>Philip Sassower </strong></p>
<p>Thank you for joining us to review the financial results of Xplore’s first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015. We appreciate your time and interest in our company. With me on the call are Mark Holleran, our President and Chief Operating Officer; and Tom Wilkinson, our Interim Chief Financial Officer. </p>
<p>Before our prepared remarks, I want to mention a few housekeeping items. If you do not have a copy of this afternoon’s press release, you can retrieve one from our website at <u>www.xploretech.com</u>, and at the conclusion of today’s prepared remarks, we will open the call to a question-and-answer session. With that said, we will now present our prepared remarks for this call. </p>
<p>To being with, let me provide some background on Xplore in case there are any new participants on the call. Based in Austin, Texas and with a presence across the globe, Xplore has been a leader and innovator in the rugged tablet space for almost 20 years. Our customers include household names like American Airlines, AT&amp;T, Verizon, Daimler, Merck, FedEx, Procter &amp; Gamble and Hertz, just to name a few.</p>
<p>These customers have chosen Xplore Solutions to extend the benefits available by deploying computer devices in the field, while minimizing the downtime and loss of productivity that otherwise occurs with non-rugged computers. With the recent acquisition of certain of Motion Computing’s assets, Xplore is now the second largest provider of rugged tablets worldwide. I encourage you to visit both our Xplore branded website, as well as <u>www.motioncomputing.com</u>, our website dedicated to Motion brand products, where you can find detailed information on our company. </p>
<p>Our first fiscal quarter was a historic one. It represents yet another record breaking quarter with revenue of approximately $24 million or 191% above last year. In the first quarter that includes revenues from our expanded offering that now includes products acquired in the Motion Asset deal. </p>
<p>It is interesting to note that revenue from our historical product like represented a significant portion of the overall increase, growing a very healthy 31% year-over-year. It also is an auspicious thought to our expanded operations with a better than expected bottom line performance, which bought for certain onetime costs related to the Motion transaction would have generated net income. </p>
<p>We are extremely proud of this strong performance in our first quarter that includes the Motion assets. As expected, the Motion deal significantly accelerated our revenue growth compared to growing Xplore organically. Our integration efforts are ongoing and we continue to work towards generating growth and synergies in the process. </p>
<p>Before turning the call over to Mark, who will provide an update on our operations, I want to formally welcome Tom Wilkinson as our Interim CFO. As disclosed in our 8-K filing last week, our long term CFO, Mike Rapisand departed Xplore for personal reasons on August 7. Due to concerns for privacy, we are not in a position of make any further comments on this departure, but thank him for his years of service and wish him well in future endeavors. </p>
<p>Mike has been replaced by Tom who has hit the ground running. He completed and signed our Form 10-Q filing. He presented this quarter’s results to our Board of Directors for approval and here he is with us today to review our fantastic performance during the quarter. We are honored to have someone of Tom’s caliber and with his level of experience join our executive management team. </p>
<p>Tom has worked both as a CFO and as an Auditor, including as a partner in charge of Xplore’s audit process for five years while at PMB Helin Donovan. We have had more than a decade long relationship with Tom and he is very familiar with the Xplore financial management process, our team and our overall business. Tom is uniquely positioned to lead Xplore’s finance and accounting function and is one of the leading candidates in our search for a permanent CFO. </p>
<p>Now to discuss our operations and to provide an update on our integration efforts, I turn the call over to Mark Holleran, our very confident President and Chief Operating Officer. Mark. </p>
<p><strong>Mark Holleran </strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Phil and thank you all, to the participants on the call for your interest and support of our company. Let me begin by stating that I am thrilled about the fantastic results achieved during the quarter. While I have always been confident in our ability to make our expanded operations profitable in a timely manner, I must admit that delivering operating income in our first quarter, both acquisitions was beyond my expectations. </p>
<p>The quarter results were aided by a number of factors, including some pent-up demand for our iX104 and C5S5 product lines in the aftermath of our previously disclosed screen issue. The later was resolved during the quarter and both product lines are back into production. In addition to higher revenue, a favorable product mix and the timing of certain cost to goods solid adjustments led to relatively strong gross margins for both our historical and acquired product lines. </p>
<p>Our integration efforts continue at a rapid pace. Under the stewardship and coordination of our management team, all functional areas have made significant strides towards complete integration. Our North American sales structure has been rationalized to effectively and efficiently address opportunities of all sizes, both through our distribution network and for our direct sales. </p>
<p>Our sales directors have been assigned sales engineering and inside sales resources to drive pipeline and revenue growth and together with our partners have been trained on all our products. A similar effort is ongoing with our international sales structure. In early September we will hold an international partner conference in Budapest, where over 50 representatives from our international channel partners will be presented our expanded product line and strategies. A similar event is in the planning stages for our North American partners. </p>
<p>Our marketing efforts has been fully consolidated and is active in generating new leads, in working with engineering and operations to plan and develop further products and to complete the important work of consolidating our online presence with a particular emphasis on search engine optimization. </p>
<p>Our engineering and operations team together with our testing labs have been successfully consolidated in our Wells Branch location, where Xplore has been located for over a decade. Existing and newly hired engineers are now working side by side to accelerate product develop and to address clients request on a timely basis. Executive management together with our sales, marketing, finance and accounting teams have been consolidated in Motion’s historical offices as we negotiate a new lease in a significantly reduced footprint. </p>
<p>The morale of the company is among the highest I have witnessed in my tenure. Our historical employees are thrilled with Xplore’s current position as the second largest rugged Table, PC company. With size comes an improved ability to attract and retain talent and to become a more impactful factor in our space. </p>
<p>Our acquired employees are also excited to part of a more viable and growing enterprise. We have experienced minimal turnover and in certain areas like engineering we have been able to retain everyone. We have initiated a compensation review to ensure that our expanded team is properly compensated, including an attractive equity incentive plan. </p>
<p>It is a great time to be involved with Xplore. In short, while we still have meaningful integration steps ahead, there has been good progress achieved in the short period and remain confident in our ability to complete this integration in a satisfactory and timely manner. </p>
<p>I now turn the call over to Tom, our Interim Chief Financial Officer who will present the financial results for the first quarter. Tom.</p>
<p><strong>Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Mark and thank you to the participants on this call for your interest in Xplore. I’m very happy to be working with Xplore again as I know the company very well and have the utmost confidence in both the financial accounting team and the quality and accuracy of the work performed. I will now review some of the more significant aspects of the financial results for the first fiscal quarter ended June 30, 2015. </p>
<p>Revenue for the first quarter was approximately $24 million, an increase of approximately $16 million or 191% compared to the prior year period. As mentioned by Phil, this growth resulted both from an increase in year-over-year revenue for Xplore’s historical products and from the inclusion of recently acquired Motion products. Approximately 78% of our revenue was generated in the United States. </p>
<p>Our gross profit percentages for the first quarter was approximately 34% compared to approximately 37% in the prior year period. These decreases in gross profit percentage principally was due to changes in the product mix sold.</p>
<p>Operating expenses increased by approximately 116% for the first quarter over the prior year period. This increase was attributable primarily to the inclusion of Motion operations. The first quarter had operating income of $369,000 compared to an operating loss of $532,000 in the prior year period. This improvement resulted from our increase in revenue and gross profit, offset by the increase in operating expenses. </p>
<p>The first quarter had a net loss of $244,000 compared to a net loss of $551,000 in the prior year period. This improvement in our bottom line resulted largely from the aforementioned operating income that was partially offset by $670,000 in non-recurring costs related to the acquisition of the Motion assets. </p>
<p>Xplore’s financial condition remains very strong with approximately $14 million in positive working capital, including approximately $11 million in cash. At the end of the quarter we have drawn approximately $4 million out of $15 million on our working capital facility and had approximately $18 million in accounts receivable generated from a number of sales towards the end of the quarter. </p>
<p>That concludes my review of the financial results. Back to you Phil. </p>
<p><strong>Philip Sassower </strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Tom. We will now move to the Q&amp;A portion of our call, in which we are happy to answer questions on our first quarter, as well as on our ongoing integration efforts related to the Motion asset deal. Before answering your questions, I want to remind you that as a matter of policy, Xplore does not provide guidance or forecast and that there are some questions we will not be able to answer because of competitive or legal considerations. </p>
<p>We now welcome your questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Alex Silverman from Special Situations Fund.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. Congratulations on a very nice quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Alex.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>How should we think about gross margins going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>I think what we see right now is we were pleasantly surprised by the gross margin, all right. Traditionally Motion was in the low 20 to mid 20’s. As you’re well aware, Xplore is in the 30’s. So we think a combined gross margin our rate will be in the upper 20’s range as we continue to work on improvements and integration within the company.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>So upper 20’s in the near term seems reasonable.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>That’s provided we get the integration and you know it really depends on the products mix and the product flow and that varies quarter-to-quarter as you know historically with us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Alex as you know, different products have different margins and it also depends upon accessories. We tend to enjoy very favorable margins on some of the accessories like docking solutions and other bells and whistles that we sell. So if you sell up to a tablet you may tend to have a lower margin than if someone buys the tablet with these other devices and that’s what – So we, even ourselves had a time when the margins at Xplore which experienced is larger margins where let’s say towards 30% and then we could be 35%, 36%, 37%, so it depends. But we are looking at this as a company to move the overall blended margin towards the 30% level.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And were there any one-time expenses in the quarter related to the Motion deal?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the cost of integration for the quarter was $670,000.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>$670,000 for…?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>That was integration. That was legal – let me – the expenses, and they were expense. There are specific expenses for like legal and accounting relating to the acquisition that is $670,000. But in the numbers they are obviously a portion of time and management and everyone is addressing to the – is being spent on that acquisition. So it’s hard to fully identify all of the costs that would be purely related to the acquisition.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>But there is no severance, because you hired folk’s right. You weren’t in a position where you were letting folks go.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran</strong></p>
<p>Well, that was covered originally with our deal with the Square One bank and you remember, this was a foreclosure. So everybody left Motion and then we just hired the people that we wanted to and Xplore [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>Okay. So $670,000 are the identifiable one time-ish kind of expenses.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>That’s a non-recurring cost.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Silverman</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks so much for the help.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Alex.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our next question is from William Gibson from Roth Capital Partners.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Gibson</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I basically had a variation of Alex’s questions and I’m pretty sure I heard that you had a cost of goods sold adjustment and I assume that’s for later due to the merger. I mean how did that work? I’m actually surprised margins were as high as they were and given your guidance going forward that seems indeed the case. So the question is, can you help me out with the adjustment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran </strong></p>
<p>We, as we mentioned to you, we had one-time integration costs all right, and that was in the neighborhood of $670,000, that’s in our P&amp;L. In regards to the margins etcetera, we did have one-time integration all right, where there was some uncollected VAT that came into our favorable cost for us and I would have to go and – I don’t have the detailed calculations on that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Gibson</strong></p>
<p>No, understood. I’m just trying to understand that going forward and in terms of the $670,000 one time or the non-recurring, was that mainly G&amp;A or how was that spread among the various operating divisions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran </strong></p>
<p>It’s mostly professional fees, so yes that would be G&amp;A.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Gibson</strong></p>
<p>Okay, good. No, I do appreciate that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Walter Ramsey for Walrus Partners.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Hey thanks. Congratulations. You guys are really hitting the ground running here. I got a couple of questions. The screen issue that was kind of interfering with the business earlier in the year, can you go into a little more detail about how that’s been resolved and if it’s completely in the rear view mirror or if there is still more work that has to be done there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Be happy to do that Walter. Just in short, the screen issues have been resolved, both on the S5C5. The new screens are shipping and on the iX104 the new screens are shipping there too.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Okay, can’t beat that. Okay, the legacy business obviously had a good quarter. Were there any big orders in there or was that just kind of business coming in on the transom. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>No, we had the large deal as we previously mentioned. AT&amp;T we’re shipping and that will continue to ship over the next several quarters, all right, and there were some other deals in the railway etcetera. So I mean we were very favorably surprised by the 30% plus increase in our traditional business other than the market place, which says that the Bobcat and Ranger X are being well received in the marketplace today.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Right. So you mentioned the Bobcat. Is the Super Bobcat close to introduction?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Super Bobcat will begin shipping this quarter and we will really do the announcement in the September timeframe because of the summer in Europe, etcetera. We’ll actually launch it over in Europe, beginning of September.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Okay, and I assume you’ve kind of shown it around to some of your customers. Are their eyes widened getting all ready or how is the response.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>I think it’s been – everybody loves it. I also think it’s the sexiest looking rugged tablet in the market with its carbon fiber bezel etcetera. The performance is outstanding. I personally believe it’s going to be one of our top selling products in the marketplace. You should get one.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>I just may, okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Walter there’s a very – look, we have a robust and growing pipeline, especially now that the screen outage has been fixed, because bear in mind, it’s hard to generate additional orders when you’re not able to ship your old order. But now that we’ve demonstrated our ability to ship the product more orders are coming in, but a good pipeline and some good activity out there, so stay close to your computer for the announcements.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so I got a couple of additional questions if you don’t mind. The Motion product line, could you spend a minute or two and just kind of highlight the real hot products that are in there and what markets are particularly good at this point.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Sure, I would say we are very favorably impressed with the R12, that’s the 12 inch device and that’s where we are receiving good traction in the traditional markets, in the utilities and field service, etcetera, but also getting some traction in the public safety marketplace. The F5 and C5, especially the F5 that continues to be a core product doing very well in a variety of different vertical markets, including field service, etcetera all right. And the CL920, the lower end product, continue to sell, but the two suite spots are the R12 and the F5 and in particular the R12.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Okay, and manufacturing those products, is there any problems that you’ve encountered or is it running pretty smooth?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>We have the usual issues in regards to integration with the LTM and we’re in the process of moving some of the product that was manufactured by Compal over to Pegatron. But Pegatron is a great ODM for us to deal with, all right. It’s a Tier I and we are fully confident that they’ll get the products in a timely and professional manner.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>And if you don’t mind, I got a couple of questions for the new CFO, Tom. Do you have the revenue breakdown between domestic sales and international?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I do. So I think I mentioned about 78% of the total revenues were USA.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Okay, very good. And a lot of Wall Street analysts don’t include the amortization of acquired intangible assets. Can you give us that number for the quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>I don’t actually have that number at my fingertips. That might be something to follow-up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Well, I think it might be a little helpful in the future to just kind of break that out, because a lot of analysts don’t use that. It’s kind of a non-cash made up number. So we kind of throw that to the side sometimes, okay. And then just one last thing I saw this morning on Bloomberg or somewhere that Apple is entering the workspace with their tablet business. Do you think that’s good or bad now that they are – is that they are coming up with all these apps for the workplace, for their products I guess.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Walter, let’s put it this way, the overall rugged tablet market is around $600 million. The amount of consumer grade tablets made by people like Apple with the iPad and Samsung Galaxy is over $7 billion. The opportunity for us in making a truly rugged solution that will operate under all kinds of conditions is to be able to cannibalize on that market and take some of those folks. </p>
<p>If it works for you that’s fine, you can buy an iPad and that’s great and they will have applications that will work for you. But if you want to be out there in an extreme environment, you can’t afford for it to experience downtime and a loss of productivity, that’s not going to cut it and that’s not their market, they are more consumer oriented. So that would be my answer to…</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Walter Ramsey</strong></p>
<p>Okay, yes I see. I mean we’ll see how it goes, but it might be good. Anyway, congratulations again. You guys have done a great job. I don’t have anything more I can say than that. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Walter.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from [Indiscernible] a Private Investor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Hello and congratulations again.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>I have a question about gross margins. Is there any chance you can give us an approximation of what gross margins were excluding that one-time adjustment you mentioned earlier in the call?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>30%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Around 30%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And about gross margins again, in the previous call you mentioned that you are about to start manufacturing new peripherals for the Bobcat and Xplore tablets and that should raise your gross margins. Is that still coming up in the future? Has that happened yet?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>That’s correct. Some of that has started and some will be this quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay, it’s good to know. And about the screen issue, one would assume that once you have the new screens being manufactured there would be kind of a rush of orders that have been pent up. Has that happened in this past quarter or is it happening now in the current monthly reported quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>It’s happened in some – mostly in the last quarter, which we’re reporting, because as we said, all of the products are shipping, which you will see as a delay in some out there, the new spring and the new products go into pilots. That can take anywhere from three to six months plus and then we will get new business coming from that also. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And about Motion, now that you’re reassured hopefully customers that they have not gotten bankrupt, have you seen increases of sales and orders there from the previous year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Yes, what we see right now is a cross pollination happening. So now some of our partners and customers now have a broader product line, all right. As we mentioned previously, 95% of the channels were complementary, 100% of the product was complementary and as we continue to train our entire sales force and field is trained, but as we continue to train more and more of our partners, we see more opportunities being cross pollinated between the organization.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran</strong></p>
<p>Let me add another thing to that Harris is this. I think that we had a superb, the best lineup of rugged tablets, PCs in the marketplace. However there are some competitors who try to take advantage of the fact that Motion had some financial difficulties and instead of talking about the quality of the product, talked about the fact the company won’t be around. </p>
<p>So I think that now that in is all one consolidated company and you have a company that has financial strength behind it and the ability of us to perform, now let’s talk about the merits, change the dialogue to talk about the merits of the product and if we have the better product, we are going to get the order as opposed to people saying, well don’t buy the product from them, because they won’t be around to deliver.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. So that sounds great, but can you confirm that Motion sales are actually increasing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>I don’t think we have the – they didn’t do quarterly data.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>We don’t have all the breakout. As we said, Motion products were in decline. Now we are in the process of growing that business. I mean it depends on what periods you’re talking about etcetera and we would have to go get to and research that data.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>All right, thanks. And about giving a complete line up and you don’t need to answer this if this is actually on your website or in the 10-Q, but can you explain quickly how it’s different product kind of fits and complements each other, because I know the differences between the different Xplore products. I’m not certain how the different Motion products fit in there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran</strong></p>
<p>Let me explain it more broadly like this. Xplore is historic product line. Now all there is is Xplore, I just want you to understand. Motion is Xplore and Xplore is the core, but basically the Xplore product, the iX104 is IP67, which means it will operate under water, it can take tremendous drops from a great height and it will take a tremendous thermal range.</p>
<p>Now the Bobcat and the Ranger X is IP65. The product – so our products are ultra rugged and fully rugged. What was the historical Motion product line is what we would call simply rugged. They were IP54 and IP52 rugged, but tended to be not quite as ultra rugged as some of our products. So now we have the full range of solutions depending upon the need and the application. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>All right. So even the most rugged Motion products were less rugged than the Bobcats in the Xplore. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran</strong></p>
<p>Exactly correct, a very fair statement. Exactly. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay, so that’s how you have the full government. All right, thank you very much for explaining this. All right, thanks again for your time to answer all my questions. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Right, next caller.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Scott Bilodeau from [Indiscernible]. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Hi guys, great quarter. I got a question, I’m just doing the math here on your press release you have. Revenue is at $24 million, gross profit of $8.15 million. I mean that math is a 34% gross margin. If I add in the 675, it’s a 37% gross margin. What am I missing? I mean is that the right number to use or what am I missing? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>I think if you are talking about what’s below the line. You are talking about the gross profit and is your sales less than your cost of goods solid, that’s your gross profit. The legal and accounting would be really more in the general and administrative area. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. So but even with the math I get a – excusing that $8.15 million divided by $24 million gives me a 34% gross margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>Correct. The overall margins were 34% between Motion and Xplore. Actually if you broke it down the Xplore margins were higher and the Motion margins were lower, but they were higher than what we had originally formally anticipated.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s what I’m trying to – I’m just trying to figure out what think. Going forward is that, was there something in the quarter that made that gee, you shift a bunch. </p>
<p><strong>A - Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>I think that when you’re associate Walter was on the phone we answered that question and said that we felt that on a going forward basis we don’t give guidance, but I thought that I would be more comfortable in targeting something like a 30% margin than a 34% margin. And that by the way is a fantastic accomplishment in comparison to where Motion was at in the low 20s to mid-20s. So that huge, huge gain that reflects the fact that under the leadership of Mark Holleran, the integration program with the team here which is superb hit the ground running and was able to accomplish a lot of good. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Correct and what I’m wondering is just why would that tick down from this quarter? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>Because as we said, there were some times like a VAT tax, a refund which you may not get at the same level next year, next quarter. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay, and that comes back through cost of goods, okay instead of below the line. All right. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Got it. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Scott. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Michael Needleman from JSAM. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Needleman </strong></p>
<p>Thank you gentlemen for letting me ask a question. Two questions, first of on the expense side of the equation, if we look at the operating expenses for this quarter, should we model further quarters at about the same rate or how do you think about that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>I would say we are a work in process right now. Bear in mind that this is a deal that was done as a result of a foreclosure. We did not have the time to do a couple of quarters of study and put in our plan, so we did this on the fly and that’s one of the reasons we were all supersized and amazed how quickly we were able to do some of the integration and get some of the benefits and the margins came in better and the results came in better than we expected. </p>
<p>So there are some areas where the integration in synergies, we can probably do some more, get some benefits, but there are actually some areas where we feel we will need to spend some money. So there will be some – at this point there will be some gives and takes on that and I would rather wait to the next quarter results to be able to – as ever quarter goes on we will know a little bit more and better about it, but if you take our current level of corporate G&amp;A that’s probably a reasonable number. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Needleman </strong></p>
<p>Thank you and the second question that I have, in terms of how you think about your overall bidding process, can you talk a little about…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>I’m sorry, you’re fading in and out. We are getting every other word.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Michael Needleman </strong></p>
<p>Sorry, it’s a bad connection. Thank you so much gentlemen. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong> </p>
<p>Our next question is from William Gibson from Roth Capital Partners.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Gibson</strong></p>
<p>Hi, just a question follow-up. I mean I had expected inventory to increase. I was surprised how much it did. Can you give a breakdown between Xplore and Motion and I know you guys don’t build it and hope they come. So I’m assuming you foresee the business out there for the build in inventory. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>We really don’t have that breakdown, we would have to go look at it. I will tell you Bill that Motion in its distribution business, in its contracts, the product when it ships from the OVM is FOB, the distributor site or the end customer. So a lot of the items that got shipped in the last week of the quarter goes into inventory. According to GAAP rule it cannot be declared revenue. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Gibson</strong></p>
<p>Oh okay, I am with you, so…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>So you will see a very favorable revenue coming into this quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">William Gibson</strong></p>
<p>Okay, understood. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tom Wilkinson</strong></p>
<p>You’re welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Jason Revland from Blueprint Capital. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jason Revland</strong></p>
<p>Yes, my question related to the expense ratio, 32%, it was largely asked but I’ll try to ask it again, maybe in a different way. As you fully integrate Motion and driver revenues north of let’s say, I’m going to make up a number $125 million. Wouldn’t you fully expect to be able to see some operating expense leverage in order to drive that number down and below say 30%. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I mean that’s a logical assumption. We are now a larger business as we continue to grow the revenue. We are very focused on the profit side of the business and so let me be very candidate. We would much rather have an $80 million profitable company than a $100 million unprofitable company and as you can see, our strategy or aim is working quite well, beyond our expectation results for this quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jason Revland</strong></p>
<p>Great, and as an unrelated follow-up, if I just look at the inventory number and the accounts receivable number without using specific math, I think that clearly points to another very large quarter that we are in currently and I’m just pointing out the basis of that. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Holleran</strong></p>
<p>I don’t give forward projection, but I always say that the company is going to grow year-to-year and you’re a smart man, you can do the math as well as I can. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>Let me answer this way Jason. We do not – we are not in the retail business. We do not build inventory for spec. So if we are building inventory, if you see inventory it has got someone’s name on it. So the reason that you saw the buildup in inventory as I think our President explained was that that was going to a place, but the title did not shift timely so that we can recognize it as revenues, so it will happen a week later.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jason Revland</strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks for the clarity guys. I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Philip Sassower</strong></p>
<p>You’re welcome. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have reached the end of the question-and-answer session. I would like to turn the floor back to Philip Sassower for closing comments.</p>
<p><strong>Philip Sassower </strong></p>
<p>We want to thank you for participating on today’s call. We hope that you share our excitement for the strong results delivered last quarter and the progress we are making towards integrating the Motion assets. As always, we remain focused on delivering continued growth and improving results for all of our stakeholders, customers, partners and stockholders alike. </p>
<p>We look forward to talking with you again in November after the release of our second quarter results for fiscal year 2016. Have a great evening and thank you for attending.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>This concludes today’s teleconference. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect your lines at this time. </p>
