<p><strong>Ping Wang</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Tina and thank you everyone for joining Aoxin Tianli’s second quarter 2015 earnings conference call.</p>
<p>Today we’re delighted to announce solid second quarter financial results. For the second quarter of 2015, revenues grew 32% year-over-year to $10.64 million, with growth across all business segments.</p>
<p>Net income increased to $0.92 million compared to $0.56 million for the same period of last year. Gross margin also improved by 15.6% to 23.3% for the second quarter of 2015, from 7.7% for the same period of last year. Our newly acquired servo and security and protection business contributed $0.79 million in revenues and accounted for 7.4% of total revenues for the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>The hog pricing environment had experienced a strong recovery during the second quarter of this year. As a result, our sales volume of specialty black hog pork products increased a lot through retail. Our black hog program generated $3.64 million in revenues through black hog, hog farming and retail sales of specialty black hog product and it accounted for more than one-thirds of total revenues in the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Since we adopted a new strategic development in July 2014, which is to transform the Company from a single revenue stream to a well diversified enterprise through targeted investments and acquisitions in selected high growth industries. We are proud of what we’ve achieved so far, as the further slowdown in China’s economy during the second quarter started to take toll on our emerging business.</p>
<p>We remain confident in the long-term prospects of our servo and security protection business. The recent Chinese stock market turmoil has made difficult for us to have earnings success on the acquisition front so far this year.</p>
<p>Looking forward, we will continue carrying out our strategic development plan and we accept both traditional hog farming business and our newly acquired business to continue driving revenue growth and margin expansion in the near future.</p>
<p>Thank you, again for all your support and attention. Next Tina will summarize our second quarter 2015 financial results on behalf of the Management Team. Thank you.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, at this time we will now be conducting a question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question will come from Paul Buseck, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, this is regarding the emerging business, servo and security, protection. In Q4 of 2014, the sales totaled $3.31 million, in Q1 of 2015, $1.85 million, in Q2 of 2015 less than a million, $0.784 million. Question, this is a very large decrease starting from the fourth quarter, is there seasonality and this is going to improve in Q3 and Q4 or what are the problems?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Paul. Let me translate to the management team. According to the answers from the CEO, Mr. Ping Wang, affected by a further slowdown in China’s macro economy during the second quarter, our emerging business suffered a significant decline in revenues, especially for Hang-ao, which was greatly affected by the overall manufacturer industry market due to the excess capacity and insufficient demand. Hang-ao slowdown from customers a large scale steel [ph] manufacturer and the power companies. That’s why Hang-ao’s revenue went down sequentially this year, as well as from the Q4 2014. However, Hang-ao is actively pursuing the new gross opportunity to mitigate the current demand weakness, such as expanding maintenance services to existing customer or taking OEM orders etcetera. We expected the revenue will become increased in the coming quarter. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>I have another question. Are you ready?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. You’re selling two hog farms, I think number two and three and you’re getting revenues from that a little more than $1 million. Let me just take a look at whatever it is in the press release, its $1.23 million. What is the remaining capacity of the hog farms left and how many hog farms are left? Is it -- will it be eight?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>So you may -- after we sold the two farms, how many farms were left so far right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. And how many hogs can they produce. These are 10,000 each, 10,000 and 10,000. So will you have eight farms left, is that the number? I was trying to confirm and how many hogs can you produce out of those for instead left, is it like 70,000 hogs or 50,000 or 80,000?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Let me repeat your question, Paul. The first question is after two hog farms sold, how many hog farms we have so far, right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>And the question is, what is the capacity of the two farms we sold, correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>No, no, of the remaining farms.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Remaining farms for the total capacity? Okay. I got it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then I have quite a little follow-up after that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Okay. You want to say now or you want me to translate to your first question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. According to the answers from the CFO, Mr. Houliang Yu, we understood that after two hogs farms sold, we have eight farms left so far. And the remaining annual production capacity is 130,000 hogs per year. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. The follow-up is under -- in your financial statement, you have plant and equipment at little over $33 million. So what -- so if you have eight hog farms left and that’s mostly what that is you divide eight into $32 million, that’s $4 million per hog farm, average. So here you’re selling two hog farms both for just little over a $1 million. So the question is, is there going to be a write-down in those the plant and equipment as listed, its too many dollars, it’s not worth $33 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, Paul. Excuse me. I will have to verify your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Should I say little more?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you confirm the question? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes, I will. Okay, so you’re selling two hog farms for $1.23 million. That means you divide by two, that’s little over $0.5 million each, $0.615 million, little over $0.5 million, okay? Now under plant and equipment, in the financial statement, you have $33.235 million, $33 million, $33,000,235. And that’s mostly hog farms. That’s the asset. So if you divide, can hog farms which you have before the sale, that’s like each one has a value of over $300 million in your financial statement, yet you’re selling two hog farms for just over $0.5 million, each. So here is the question. Because of what I said, that $33 million is an over statement, they’re not worth $33 million. You have to do a financial write-down, is that the -- that’s the question. Is that over valued? You have to write it off, we can’t get $33 million not anywhere near $33 million for the remaining hog farms, for all hog farms. Is that -- does that make sense?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Let me translate to the management team.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anthony S. Chan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Paul.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anthony S. Chan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, it’s Tony. I will answer the question. So the management said, included in the $33 million net PPU on the Company’s balance sheet that also include assets for the two newly acquired business and OV-Orange. It also include amount of asset for the black hog programs [indiscernible]. So this is not just the 10 hog farms.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I just -- yes, I think I understand that there would be some of that, but I was just wondering if the set value is too high. That was really my question, but you …</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anthony S. Chan</span></strong></p>
<p>At this moment they don’t feel there is a need to write down, write-off some of the [multiple speakers].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Okay, so here is the -- probably the last question, follow-up, is there a plan to sell any more hog farms, because of over capacity?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anthony S. Chan</span></strong></p>
<p>Tina, can you handle this one?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anthony S. Chan</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>So far we do not have plans to sell more hog farms in the near future. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, thank you very much. That’s all the questions I have. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Thanks, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from Mar Griffin of Triangle Capital. Please go ahead. Marc, your line is open; perhaps it’s muted on your end.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marc Griffin</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m sorry. I was on mute, I apologize. Hello, everyone. Your stock price has been weak over the last month or two and its now trending below your cash value. Have you considered any share repurchases or dividends to boost investor confidence? Also, are we going to have any issues with NASDAQ listing? It’s been five or eight days now below a dollar. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>According to answers from the Chairman and CEO, Mr. Ping Wang, firstly the Company’s price was sustainably undervalued and impacted by the bobble in the NASDAQ stock market in the first half of the year. The Company did some good -- received some privatization recommendations in the past several months. However, the management teams do believe that the U.S capital market is more material than any other markets. So I believe the value of the Company will eventually be fairly reflected in the stock price over time as long as we can consistently deliver the solid results from the Company. And secondly, if the stock price remains at the depressed levels for a extended period of time, the management team will consider taking some necessary actions for example as you said the share buyback or the dividend to meet the listing requirements and also to boost the investors confidence. For the stock price under $1, you’re correct. It’s below $1 for an extended period of time. We may have the rates to not meet the compliance with NASDAQ listing rule, so we will try our best to make more efforts in all kinds of business to keep the stock price up and we will publicly keep our investors posted for any updated information. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marc Griffin</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And can I ask one other question related to the new business …</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marc Griffin</span></strong></p>
<p>… since they have declined significantly, because of market pressures, I believe there were earn outs related to when you acquired those businesses? Can you explain how those work and if we’re on target to not pay them, because the businesses have not done that well? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Marc, you mean the newly acquired business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marc Griffin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, the newly acquired business, the two businesses, the servo and that haven’t been doing well. Did they have earn outs? I saw it on profit targets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Thank you. According to the answers from the Chairman and CEO, Mr. Ping Wang, as well as the last question provided from the Investor, Paul, we know that the reason from the decrease of the newly acquired business was only because of the environment in China for the steel [ph] manufacturer and partner in power companies [indiscernible]. And for the earn out agreement, about whether Hang-ao and OV-Orange can achieve their targets. We are cautiously optimistic about the Hang-ao and hoping that overall market can recover in the second quarter -- in the second half of the year. As with OV-Orange, although we see more challenges and the topic appears more of this trend. We think, we still have fair chance to meet the target in 2015. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marc Griffin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And can I just follow-up on the pork business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Marc Griffin</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you quantify the price changes we’ve seen; it appears to be a big part of the consumer price index in China and other things that seems to go up a lot, where do you view the pork price for the rest of the year? Thank you, guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>According to the answers from the CFO, Mr. Houliang Yu, we understand that with respect to -- of the pork pricing environment in China, after the downturn for the past two plus years, it is now recovering nicely. The pork price has gone up significantly this year, which helps the Company. It reflected in the second quarter financial results. For example in the first quarter in this year, the average selling price for our regular breeder hogs, regular market hogs, and black hogs were $263, $183, and $216, respectively. In the second quarter, this year, the average selling price for them increased to $271, $206, and $354, respectively. And currently the hog price is showing upward trend, although [indiscernible], we expect the overall pork price to remain favorable for the remainder of the year and it will have our revenues in the rest time of the year. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from -- a follow-up from Paul Buseck, a Private Investor. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, the -- Triangle Capital, he was asking about the bonus paid for 2014. And that was probably paid to the emerging business. And that was like almost $2 million and the total sales in that emerging business were only $3 million last year, little over $3 million. So that turns out to be very, very generous like over payments. So the question is how not to repeat this mistake in the future, that should be in a bonus for many, many years without more incentive or until it recovers. So the question is how do you avoid that problem, because the business did not develop. And the second question is, are there any restrictions by the government on stock buybacks? Hello? Hello, can you hear me?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Paul.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, can you hear my question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Can you please repeat your question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. One moment. The stock incentive that was awarded for 2014 was like almost $2 billion in stock, it was like $1.70 a share value at that time. And the total sales in 2014 for the emerging business was only less than $4 million for that. So it was very, like business was not as good Q1, Q2, maybe not so good in Q3. So they were over paid an incentive as things developed, maybe goes okay for 2014. So how will you avoid this mistake, the incentive program should be reevaluated, so not to do that again, there was too much payment. That was question number one. Then question number two was, if management decides to buy some stock back -- remains depressed, does the government have the restriction on management from buying stock in the U.S market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>So Paul, let me confirm with you -- with the two questions, okay?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>You mean the newly acquired business since with the emerging business is too much payment for the intensive …?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, for 2014 it was really over payment it turns out. That was too generous.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>And the question is can that be adjusted or not to make that mistake in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>You mean a too much payment for what?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>For the -- there was a bonus plan put in place.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>For the Company employee, right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, for the employees. And that probably went to the emerging business, because the hogs -- hog business didn’t do very good last year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>So that I don’t think they met incentive, it was just a new business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>So the total sales in emerging business in 2014 were only $4 million or less. Yet, there was $2 million, almost $2 million in incentive stock given to the invoice, things like generous, too much. And even if they met incentive, that’s like too much and can that I think Triangle Capital ask, can that be adjusted or taken back, because it’s too generous and how do -- that should be enough incentive for the next five years, anyway. That’s question one. Now question two was should management decide to buy some of the stock back in the U.S market to support the price. Is there any government restriction on management from doing that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>You mean, is there any restriction ….</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Chinese government.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Chinese government, okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Put by the Chinese government to do that, because of cash flow. That’s question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. Let me translate.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Paul. According to the answers from the Vice President Mr. Yang Chen, we understood, he firstly verified the bonus is not the -- is not performance based on the incentive. It is the supplementary part of the management and the key employees’ compensation. So the decrease for the newly acquired business, the reason is not only -- is not because due to the bonus, it’s because the China’s economy slowdown. And our business is very closely affected by the China’s economy. So that is not kept for long time and for the OV-Orange in the first half of this year, the Company is too optimistic about the security and protection market. And currently the Company is adjusting its strategic direction to expand the [indiscernible] security and protection market, and also gradually stepping into the educational devices market to compliment current security and protection business. We are full of confidence for the two newly acquired business and way do believe that it will come back and we increase the revenues in the rest of the year. And for the second quarter from you, there is no restriction from Chinese market to the U.S listed company to for the share buyback, as our CEO and Chairman said, the U.S stock market is more material and we still believe our stock price will eventually be fairly treated in this finance market. And we will contemplate it [indiscernible] the results in the next quarter. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paul Buseck</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you so very much for that answer. I appreciate it. And that’s all I have.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Tina Xiao</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Paul.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
