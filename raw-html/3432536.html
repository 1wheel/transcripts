<p>Hello everyone, we’re now ready to begin our earnings call today. Before we begin officially we like to invite you to spend some time in the memory of our Former CFO. If possible please turn off your cellphone, close your eyes and very quietly in your own way think back about your interactions with our CFO, professionally or privately. CFO was a very good supervisor, a very good friend and partner. We miss him and we’re very grateful for his contributions to ASUS.</p>
<p>And we’re also grateful that he has spent so much time interacting with investors and media friends. Thank you.</p>
<p>We will now begin today's earnings call. I will be presenting the financial results and the CEO will represent the outlook. In the second quarter the net revenue was 99.4 billion down 3% from first quarter. The first and the second quarter of this year we see in the industry experienced a lot of noises, there was weaker demand. At ASUS we were able to stabilize our shipment volume, at the same time we saw growth in our phone shipment that is why in the second quarter the net revenue was relatively flat and relatively stable against the industry and seeing the changes - in view of the changes in the industry this year our focus is on optimizing the company health and optimizing our product mix. In terms on notebooks we’re focusing on gaining notebooks, theme notebooks and new X-Series which we have launched in the first quarter.</p>
<p>These are all HERO products with unique selling points and higher ASPs and this will help us in our notebook business in terms of ASP and margin. During the first quarter and second quarter phone business we transitioned from ZenFone 1 to ZenFone 2, ZenFone 2 has higher price and our 4G memory model has been selling very well with better price and better margins than the average phone product. With this help our gross profits grew from 13.2% in the first quarter to 14.3% in the second quarter. Operating expenses went up slightly due to marketing expenses associated with product launches, operating income was 4.7 billion flat against the first quarter. Against this volatility in the industry we think this performance is relatively stable.</p>
<p>Non-op items, in the second quarter we had about 400 million in exchange gains, we also had 550 million dividend gains from Advantech. Pretax income was 6 billion up 28% from the first quarter net income 4.7 billion up 27% from the first quarter with a paid in capital of 7.43 billion, EPS for the second quarter was NT$6.27 per share, EPS for the first half of the share was NT$11.23 per share.</p>
<p>Looking at the year-over-year chart, net revenue and gross profit both grew by around 4%, and operating income grew by 7%. For non-op items in 2014 we had a onetime large sum exchange gains due to the exchange rate between USD and RMB, relatively speaking the exchange gain from the second quarter of this year was smaller and net income was flat against last year about NT$4.7 billion. Non-op items in the second quarter we had about 430 million exchange gains mainly due to the fact that in the second quarter the USD appreciated against or was rather stable against other emerging currencies and when the exchange rate is stable we’re more able to make exchange gains. Dividend income we received in the second quarter dividend income from Advantech in the two of NT$550 million. Balance sheet at the end of second quarter cash and cash equivalents NT$72.4 billion a very health and safe level.</p>
<p>Inventories, NT$91.8 billion higher than the first quarter, this is due to the fact that the third quarter we are launching a lots of Window 10 models. In our phone business we’re also expecting some product transitioning from Intel chips to Qualcomm chips. At the same time we’re preparing inventories for some strategic components. For example Intel CPU, stakeholders equity at the end of the second quarter was 1.64 billion, 30 down from the first quarter that was due to the fact that we moved from dividend of 12.6 billion from equities to liabilities because our ex-dividend date was August 10 and September 2 we’re going to pay our cash dividends, it's NT$17 per share and 12.6 billion in total.</p>
<p>As for days of AR and days of AP, they were relatively stable, days of inventory was higher. However the inventories at the second quarter was for the preparation for the third quarter and we expect in the third quarter the revenue will grow. And by the end of the third quarter we expect the days of inventory will move back to a more normal level.</p>
<p>Business highlight, the PC Industry experienced some seasonal decline from the first quarter to the second quarter also we see weaker demands so far this year. That is why PC's contribution to revenue dropped from 67% to 61%, phones on the other hand are gaining importance. Together with tablets phones and tablets contributed to 22% of our revenue up from 16% in the first quarter. Other products were relatively stable.</p>
<p>Now let's look at revenue by region, basically stable, in Europe especially in Eastern European countries. We had some slow time due to currency volatility. Now to control risk we have been very cautious in terms of our shipments and orders in Eastern European countries and in the second quarter we saw some demand picking up in Eastern European countries. However at the start of the third quarter recently we again see some volatility in emerging market currencies including Russian ruble. This is something we are closely monitoring, that is the update.</p>
<p>Shipment outlook, in the second quarter PC shipment was 4.8 million including 4.3 million in notebook, mobile shipment was 6 million including 5 million from phones which was higher than our target of 4.8 million. Looking at the third quarter considering where the industry is at and some impact from currency fluctuations our goal is to focus on company health and the positioning of our brand. We would like to deliver reasonable profit and revenues. So our targets for the third quarter are as follows PC 5.4 million including 4.8 million from notebooks, that’s 13% growth quarter over quarter. For mobile our target is 7.8 million units including 7 million phones. Together, we expect mobile to deliver a growth between 20% and 30% those were the financial results. Next we would like to invite our CEO to give us the outlook.</p>
<p><strong>Jerry Shen</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone. I will go over our Q2 performance and give you an update on our Q3 and Q4 and elimination race is going on in the PC industry and the mobile industry. This will continue for the end of this year till 2016 and for PC we believe the elimination race will end in 2017 and ASUS would like to remain top three in the PC business and to do that we are relying on our innovation and speed of change, those are our cornerstones. In the next five years our products will be in those four categories PC mobile, robotics and IoT, in terms of software or cloud. We are already in monetizing from the screen so our phones and tablets. We are seeing some great results in this area. I revise this chart and I think this is a better way to present the data to tell you about PC and tablets, tablets are weak right now.</p>
<p>Let's see this bar chart, in 2017 possibly in the fourth quarter the revenue from mobile business may surpass that of PC and we see our quarterly changes on track and in 2018 we believe mobile revenue will exceed PC revenue. During this transition well we're lucky in a sense that our PC business is profitable and our phone business is healthy. If we can get greater revenue from phones that would be even better and we do see our phone revenue growing. Positive growth in the second quarter possibly positive growth in the third quarter as well and we hope we will see greater revenue growth in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Ultimately, we hope we get the same kind of profit from both the PC business and the phone business. And considering our PC business you see first the commercial segment in China the desktop market is very large and our commercial segment is doing very well in terms of desktop in both China and Taiwan. And Tablets now are more and more in the commercial segment not just for audio visual entertainment but also for business use.</p>
<p>Notebook, Chromebook and then gaming, I'll talk more about gaming later. We've made great progress in gaming this year. Also great progress in Zen book, there is also a two in one [indiscernible] such as T100, some models are in display outside. As for mainstream products we have some plans to launch products in September to launch more aggressive attacks and then we have EeeBook and Chromebook. Those are the six major segments of our PC business. Let's quickly go over them. This is from our gaming series, this year we're doing very well in gaming especially in notebook gaming. This is the desktop gaming model and this is a monitor for gaming. As for example ZenBook UX305 is enjoying very high sale through rate and record high. In fact this is the thinnest notebook in the world and this one is selling very well.</p>
<p>This one is ZenBook Pro, very stylish and excellent performance in terms of CPU, GPU, monitor, battery, SSD, great performance in every aspect within SSD of greater than 1 gigabyte per second throughput, very good DRAM as well this is one is selling very well.</p>
<p>There is [indiscernible] and also T100 in our 2-in-1 category, T100 did very well in 2014 and in Q3 we’re launching a new metal model, we expect this model will further increase the momentum of T100 and we also improved the battery of our T model. We have great expectations for this - this is then all in one which will be launched in September. Strong features are out. It's very beautiful, great performance and very reasonable pricing. This is about empowering luxury for everyone. The price won't be in the range of Apple products. We just set the price at a level that is only slightly higher than the mainstream product. So looking at our products, our gaming products enjoy a year-over-year growth of around 40% while the industry is suffering. This is a great performance because mainstream products are all engaged in price wars. It's a blood bath. But gaming products are not engaged in a price war and then ZenBook is also doing well with greater than 200% growth. We didn't have EeeBook last year but if you combine EeeBook plus T100 then in 2015 we saw an annual growth rate of 10%, in terms of mainstream products it's a very competitive landscape right now. That is why we have some products in our pipeline. We started planning in the second quarter and we will launch some very aggressive products in October.</p>
<p>Next point, T100, it's still very good all in one product. Another highlight looking at different regions, in the second quarter China was our test market. While the overall PC market in China declined. ASUS numbers come from our internal numbers whereas industry numbers come from IDC. In China in the second quarter we enjoyed a year-over-year growth of 20% and we expect a 5% growth in the third quarter so the Q2 and Q3 in China for us is looking better than 2014. In the U.S. last year our T100 sold very well, if exclude that we are better than the market. In the U.S., the notebook market is growing and the desktop market is experiencing major declines and we have a small base in desktop business here. Same thing for Japan, T100 also sold very well in Japan. T100 drove a lot of growth last year, this year we're relaunching T100 trying to recapture that momentum.</p>
<p>Now looking at the second half of the year, we see some opportunities in Asia Pacific, in the second quarter the most difficult region for us was Europe with Russia being the most difficult country between January and March we virtually didn't sell much in Russia. However according to GfK our south rate was still ranked number one or number two, that means our inventory was low and we started shipping to Russia in May and June and the first quarter the ruble against USD went from 30 to 70 and we quoted in USD and our Russian customers couldn't handle that. In the first quarter Europe was difficult, in the second quarter we saw that the Russia market direction a market only recovered to half of its normal level. And Russia is a very important country for us in Europe. It's not in full recovery yet, that is why the European region is still a difficult battlefield for us.</p>
<p>Moving on to mobile we have three series as before. We recently launched the tablet. It's very well received. I think this one has the world's best performance, also the thinnest. It also has this true to life display technology which is used in TV, this is an IC, second one, we have a model called ZenPad theater with six speakers, very good combination. Tablets, in our days are used to for audio, entertainment and for social networking and browsing. And another important purpose is for commercial use, so audio visual features are very important for a tablet. We are also able to offer a lot of customization. Visual Master is a display technology, we are the first one to apply that TV technology to tablet and we empower luxury for everyone offering great performance, excellent customer experience with very reasonable pricing.</p>
<p>We've been implementing this. Our total lifecycle is greater than 10 million. We are recently selling out our first generation and sell through rate is over 95%. And we expect to clear all of the products at the end of August. That's what I call seamless transition. We are able to maintain the price throughout the year, we set the price last year and the price remain stable till the second quarter this year. That's how you make your phone business profitable. So our strategy right now is to set the price once and of course when you launch in the quarter that you have launched a product profitability may be difficult. However you are not going to lower your price anymore so that model can turn profitable, that is our strategy. We try to maintain the price and then ZenFone 1 did very well.</p>
<p>Now with the new ZenFone, with ZenFone 2 there are two models both featuring 5.5 inch displays, in order to distinguish between different models we have different labels for example Laser with a laser focus feature and Selfie and Deluxe, Deluxe offers to best performance. These different models will have unique selling points and customers can easily distinguish between different models. That's what we are doing for ZenFone 2, let me quickly go over them.</p>
<p>This is ZenFone 2 Deluxe, with you see crystal miracle with the world's first number one or number two performance, we are number one or number two in the Android camp. This is our Selfie, featuring laser focus and front flash. Dual flash, this laser focus and the focus time is only 0.3 seconds compared to a normal camera a 0.9 second and we use Gorilla 4, this is a Corning very similar to Sapphire glass in terms of harness and we are offering a five magnet speaker with SonicMaster different tuning for base and higher pitches. We set bands a lot of effort [indiscernible] this one.</p>
<p>For laser, of course it offers laser autofocus and we put in all high end features which is costly but we think this is worthwhile. Now let's quickly look at our PixelMaster 2.0 and this is backlight mode and this is low light mode with a technology we are able to increase light sensitivity four times to offer a better resolution and we also offer beautification mode. People say you cannot trust photos on Facebook due to this beautification. As for you we have seen five themes, one creative studio for example meaning movie, which I use a lot. You take about 10 photos and in less than one minute you can create a mini movie, collage and Zen Circle, Zen Circle is similar to Instagram with social media features where people can share photos and this is studio, second, personalized offering font, themes launcher and mode, we have easy mode to snap you and kids mode and we also have the Zen Motion and safety and security. We have put all of our apps on Android Play Store. The benefit of that is we do not have to do FOTA. We can offer a real-time instant update.</p>
<p>Right now we have more than 250 million downloads. We have 33 apps in Google Play. Our average rating from user is 4.5 sometimes 4.8, in Q2 we already saw higher revenues from this one. I cannot disclose the number right now but now we are getting more revenues from phones with recommendation, preloads, recommendation Game Center contents, most of those contents are free for download with a few premium contents. That's where we are doing in terms of ZenUI monetization. Now ZenFone business breakthrough, we are really pushing the envelope in terms of product we are empowering luxury for everyone. In terms of marketing we use the word of mouth marketing. Of course the premise of that is you have great products. We have great products and we are also doing very good word of mouth marketing.</p>
<p>In terms of channel, we work with our channel partners and we use the same model across different markets. In terms of service we have ZenCare, in Taiwan if you make an appointment with our service center then you can have your problem resolved within one hour you have to make an appointment first because when you do that we can prepare materials beforehand and when you come you can be sure that you can pick up your product in one hour. We spend a lot of effort managing our community in Taiwan, China, India, Indonesia and the Philippines we have lots of fans, in terms of supply chain. We do daily inventory control by country, by model. If we see a surplus we can turn off the tap so to speak. That's how we manage to supply the supply chain and then we have created then you.</p>
<p>And these are our accessories, we are adding a few accessories for phones for example Zen Power we are selling 300,000 units per month. In Q4 we expect the volume to be around a 1 million units per month. People like this kind of accessory and this one will be launched in August and this Zen Flash is like a professional grade flash. This will be launched in August. We believe these accessories are offer better experience for our customers and this remains our target. In July we went through transitioning. We use Intel Chips for our high end products and we use Qualcomm chips for mainstream products and we used immediate tech solutions for one low end per model and we expect to finish the transition in August.</p>
<p>Our factories are very busy right now and the demand is very high and this is our range. So that was our overall update. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Nick Wu</strong></p>
<p>Thank you CEO, we will now go into the Q&amp;A session and once again I have to repeat this three friendly reminder this earnings call is being broadcast live. When you ask a question please first tell us your name and affiliation and please ask one question at a time and then after we provide an answer you can then ask the next question. Thank you very much for your cooperation. We will now take questions.</p>
<p>Well this morning the board meeting we decided to act Nick to be our new CFO. Congratulations to Nick, let me first say a few words. There's been an incident. It's a sad event. Everyone is saddened by this. However against this backdrop the company still has to maintain the operations. Personally I believe at ASUS the foundation of our company is the company culture. The vision set by our leaders and how they lead us by example. With this company culture in all departments in marketing, in finance, in accounting we all have very talented people, people who are good at tech issues, forex issues, hedge etcetera. We have a lot of capable people working on these different issues. What we can do is to make sure the operations are smooth and we have every confidence that with our company culture and with our system we have been able to cultivate a lot of talented people. We can ensure a smooth operation of the company and personally, to be frank I wasn't prepared to take the position. People in finance tend to be introverted but I used to be in a position where I was in charge of Investor Relations.</p>
<p>So perhaps more people outside of ASUS know about me and my job will be primarily about communicating with the outside. As for accounting and tax affairs we have another manager Ms. [indiscernible] who is our Accounting Manager, she will be charge of that and we do have other managers taking care of other issues so </p>
<p>I'll just briefly talk about this. Our hope is that we will keep moving forward, in Taiwan in the past few years different companies have been experiencing some difficulty and we're lucky in that we have a very solid foundation. Our Chairman and our CEO are very good leaders and our performance has been relatively stable. We want to keep doing this, we believe a parent company can be very influential for the entire supply chain. We'll have some impact on the national economy as well and we count on your support. Thank you very much. Congrats </p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Q - Arthur Hseih</strong></p>
<p>Arthur Hseih from UBS, a question for Jerry. Of course we are saddened by David's passing. Is ASUS going to do some adjustment. Of course I understand his job, his responsibilities are taken care of by other people but what about the management structure, any room for improvement and of course we are happy to see that you are promoting from within providing greater opportunity for your own people. But in addition to that is there are some other adjustments that is required?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>You're talking about job concentration?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>Well take you for example you are arguably the most hardworking CEO in Taiwan. You get great results wherever you pay attention to. But what about areas that you don't get pay attention to. Perhaps you can strengthen the institution because you have to rely on the system not individuals to put it bluntly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Regarding this chairman. And I actually talk about this issue very often. Chairman and I treat this issue Shih and I treat this issue very seriously. Talent cultivation is important, we need different people in different positions very capable people in various positions. That's how we can ensure our long term operation and we've been talking about this for quite some time not just due to the event. We have some preparations.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>Now back to business, could you talk about some popular models for example UX305. You don't see a products with such excellent price performance ratio such as UX305 and T300 or T100, in second quarter. How much contribution did these products contribute and in the third quarter. Do you expect higher demand for those products?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>As a percentage of revenue for those products accounted for about 20%. They used to be 10% in the second quarter it was 20%. We do believe this can go up. We have ZenBook that's doing very well. We also focus on gaming, for high end products, gaming is a very important theme we have a ROG series and we have set a ROG committee, our gaming includes desktop notebook, motherboard, monitor and VGA. The gaming products series actually covers five different business units and that is why we have our an ROG committee which coordinates among different business units where [indiscernible] in terms of gaming. As for ZenBook are now managed by sell through rate. Every day I see the sell through figures going up, so the growth of ZenBook is phenomenal while the PC market is slowing down. ZenBook offers us both quality and quantity.</p>
<p>As for our Zen AiO, it offers superb price performance ratio. Our Zen AiO. He's going to be a breakthrough. Zen AiO and ZenBook are in the same category and our gaming product G20 and 751they're in the same category, 15 inch and 17 inch. They are contributing more and more to our revenue.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you confirm one thing, 20% include which products and models?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Gaming plus ZenBook.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>What about you UX?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>UX is ZenBook.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>What's your take on the gaming market? How big is the market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>There are two categories. First, productivity work related. Another segment is connected primarily dominated by phones whereas productivity is dominated by PC, as for tablets maybe we'll see tablets in commercial segments for example restaurants now use tablets to take orders. Very convenient. Right now people use tablets for audiovisual consumption. But in the future we see stronger demand for tablets from the commercial segment. So I see there are those two categories, we're talking about gaming. This is something that we will never be replaced by phones. Of course phones are very useful people use their phones every day. They even sleep with their phones. People spend a lot of time every day with phones and that’s why the turnover of phones is also very high.</p>
<p>Take China for example. People purchase a new phone every eight months. A person may have one or two or three phones and in Taiwan it's about 12 to 18 months. As for gaming we see the gamer population going up and this is something that cannot be replaced by phones no matter how powerful phones are.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>What about the third quarter. Now those high end models account for 20% and a percentage may go up. And these are high end products enjoy a higher margin and you also maintain that higher margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>In principle our mainstream models such as KX are engaged in price wars, but this part the HERO, these high end products can enjoy higher margins with healthy revenue growth. This will help us maintain a healthy margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>Last question on phones especially about product transition. How much contribution do expect from new products and what's your take on the margin of new products?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>The new models are going to replace the first generation of products, it's a complete, replacements. In the second quarter we worked very hard. We had two transition, we have Intel chips in high end products, Qualcomm chips in mainstream products and media tech solution in one entry model and a complete transition will be in August. In the third quarter, I think we will only see a very few number of first generation products so new products will account for 60% to 70% of our revenue and the margin of second generation models will not be lowered in our first generation product. And the first generation was doing very well to begin with.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Wu</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me quickly one point about operating margin. Our target was 2% to 3% and now I can confirm that we did reach that target in the second quarter. Of course we want to keep hitting that target even improve on the operating margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Hseih</span></strong></p>
<p>Could you remind us again of the relationship between scale and margin?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>When scale is higher the percent - the overhead as a percentage of revenue will be lower. But we have to be conservative in some aspects because in some countries in one or two countries we have lower margins as you probably know which market that is, China for example. But China now accounts for a very small percentage of our revenue. So when scale is up and if there is a Chinese component then margin maybe go down slightly.</p>
<p>Importantly what we want to achieve is that when we reach a certain scale the profitability from our phone business is stable for example the net profit from phone business can be similar to our profit margin from PC so you can simply look at the revenue and you will get a big picture. That's our target for next year and this year we're on the right track.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Young from Barclays [ph]. [Indiscernible] was Skylake was launched in August. How is that going to affect the demand for back to school season?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>In July we saw something negative. In July and August we could only use old Intel chips and in September we're going to produce a lot of Skylake products but we expect significant shortage of Skylake globally not just for ASUS, that is why in August we have Windows 10 but Skylake only accounts for a very small percentage. In the fourth quarter Skylake will take a higher percentage. We need to manipulate the percentage because some users prefer to buy the latest Skylake chips, but Skylake is in significant shortage right now in the third quarter. So yes the output is being delayed but September you will see an upturn.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Does that mean the demand for the third quarter will be delayed to the fourth quarter due to the delay of Skylake?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>This year the demand for a PC overall is weak, it's not as strong as before. For ASUS I think we seem to have bottomed out in the second quarter. Of course the second half of the year tends to be better. Our hope is that our Q3 is better than Q2 and Q4 is better than Q3 that can be expected. But that’s better performance is that due to seasonality or demand picking up once again we think the PC demand this year is relatively weak. We are conservative in that. But what I have seen is that in the second quarter we seem to have bottom out in terms of PC demand and we think the demand will be picking up later.</p>
<p>Well Windows 10 will help PC this year because Windows 10 is being Windows is offering free upgrades right now. Some say yes some say no or even negative impact, why? Because when people get free upgrades they may not have to need to buy a new product, free upgrades help Windows the most. Windows is capturing big data and capturing users, but for us device manufacturers free upgrades may not be a positive thing, not always.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Vince from [indiscernible]. David used to remind us about inventory issues. I would like to get more details on the inventory situation right now in channels and in ASUS internally and I would like to say about Q3 target are those aggressive targets or comfortable targets?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Wu</span></strong></p>
<p>Speaking of inventory, we talk about channels looking at the start of July. I'll talk about finished products and then talk about materials and at the end of June our denominator went down and in August demand is picking up so the denominator becomes larger. Right now we see that inventory is normal in Asia Pacific. As for Europe it's nearly normal, the inventory of finished products is getting back to normal. It's okay, it will be okay by the second half of August.</p>
<p>As for material inventory. We are implementing very tight control by the end of September. Things will be very well under control. The PC industry is weaker right now so our material inventory level is only so that we have enough materials till the end of the quarter. We used to have some carry overs but now we only take inventory so that we have enough materials till the end of the quarter specially for components that are suffering great volatility such as DRAM. There are some key components we believe are very safe and the Q4 demand is going to be higher than Q3 than we allow those materials to have some left over. This is what all business units under ASUS is doing right now. We are implementing a very tight material inventory control, by the end of September we think we're going to see an okay situation.</p>
<p>Second question, those targets you can say they are most likely targets, not too aggressive not too conservative either.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Wei Chen</span></strong></p>
<p>Wei from Goldman Sachs. My question is about phones, phone companies and PC companies are not the same, phone companies have higher OpEx due to R&amp;D and marketing and ASUS has done a good job in that you've been growing the phone revenue without seeing cost going up too much. So how has ASUS achieved that? Looking ahead at 2018 when you're mobile revenue will overtake that of PC revenue, how do you contain your OpEx? Thank.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Two major expenses for mobile business, first R&amp;D, second marketing. We used a new type of marketing, word of mouth marketing. It's also about experience marketing. We do a product launches for example last week we just had a product launch in India where people can experience how great products are. Users can tell other users this is what I mean by word of mouth marketing. People these days are very savvy, they use here phones every day. If they like a phone they are going to tell other people.</p>
<p>We may see R&amp;D expenses going up slightly. As for OpEx, if we sell 2 million phones per month then the overhead as a percentage of revenue will be very similar to a that of PC business. and when the volume is even higher we can even drive down the overhead or OpEx because we do a very orthodox word of mouth marketing. Marketing expenses are there, they're high but they are not going to go up and up forever.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Wei Chen</span></strong></p>
<p>What about R&amp;D expenses?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Originally phone revenue was smaller. Right now the R&amp;D expenses from phones and tablets are actually smaller than those of PC, we are managing this very well. So we are managing the R&amp;D expense as well and the overhead very well. Earlier we said that if you sell more phones in China your margin they actually go down hence your profitability. So how can a ASUS balance this, for example your phone exposure in different markets. In China we are starting from virtually zero most of our shipments or sales volume comes from markets outside of China. And we’re seeing fast growth. We are not going to be like other companies from China where China market revenue accounts for a large percentage. Right now China revenue for us is close to zero, in the future it may go up to 30 percent. So 70% percent of our revenue is going to be very healthy. We will only feel the pressure from the remaining 30% so to speak.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Wu</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me from a finance perspective, most of our profits of phones come from Southeast Asia, Taiwan and Eastern European countries. The China market for us financially is an incremental opportunity and the China market is very competitive. So perhaps the China market may not be very profitable for us. We may only be able to breakeven but we can really capture profitability from Asia Pacific region. For us China market is an opportunity, an option, it provides us with incremental opportunity, it may not add a lot of profits for us but once again it does not affect our a very healthy operation and profitability in Southeast Asia.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Grace Chen</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Grace from Morgan Stanley. I saw that your profit from this second quarter was better than expected and we saw a pick-up in full margin and your guidance for the third quarter was better than your competitors. I'd like to begin with smartphones. Earlier you said that shipment target remained in the range of - remains in the range of 17 million to 25 million. Looking at your performance in the first three quarters earlier you said that 20 million was a reasonable expectation but your first three quarters were very good, are you going to adjust it upwards?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>For phone, we will keep that range. Our phone business is doing very well in all markets outside of China. We can see good growth. However we are in the transition phase and there is going to be some risk, if we are going to adjust that target it will happen in the fourth quarter. If the product vision goes well then we may adjust the targets but we have the lower and upper limit we believe the range is very reasonable.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Grace Chen</span></strong></p>
<p>Your phone competitors are lowering their shipment guidance. So what is ASUS doing better than your competitors?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>You're asking about phones? Well we manage by the sell through rate, I think for our phone business the best thing we have been doing is that we produce according to the sell through situation [ph], of course when you produced the first batch of products you have no idea what the sell through will be however when sell through information comes in you can then decide whether you want to produce a certain model for how many, for which country. That is why we can prevent product transitioning from causing pains for the company.</p>
<p>Another thing we do word of mouth marketing for our phones, our products have a very good positioning with very reasonable pricing. That is why we don't have to lower the prices of our models. After three months or after six months we don't even have to do that in month 10. The prices can be maintained throughout the year. For example in Taiwan a model already sells for NT$5000 we don't have to lower the price. When you lose money in the phone business is that's because when you first launch your product you may be profitable but later on when the demand is weaker you may have to lower your price. And that can create a disaster for a phone company, but at ASUS our strategy is to empower luxury for everyone. So that does not happen to us. We don't have to do price reductions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Grace Chen</span></strong></p>
<p>What about your guidance for margin guidance for the third quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Wu</span></strong></p>
<p>Margin guidance for the third quarter, legally speaking we are not allowed to disclose that information here but our strategy is simple to maintain stable operation, to maintain stable revenue and profit growth that remains the same.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Grace Chen</span></strong></p>
<p>Last question, PC inventory, we talked about inventory days, in Q3 do you expect inventory days to go down compared to Q2?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Of course when channels slowdown then inventories go up. We are doing adjustments in the coming months. By the end of September we expect inventory days to be lower, people had greater expectations for second quarter. However the results were not as people expected but we reacted very quickly between June and August, we’re adjusting that every month.</p>
<p>By end of September we think inventory days will be lower, but I cannot tell you how much right now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Robert from Merrill Lynch. Sorry I missed an earlier part, your operating margin of 4.8% is actually outstanding considering the austere environment in the second quarter. Could you tell us how come you enjoyed this operating margin growth given how bad second quarter was? Also emerging market demand, in the first half of the year you had the Russia issue, in the second half of the year maybe other countries will be the problem. So how do you control your currency risk? There may be some surprises in store that will affect your revenues or profit. So how do you manage that? How do you maintain your profitability?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Wu</span></strong></p>
<p>From the perspective of finance, in a second quarter notebook shipment was indeed lower than our expectation. Market was one factor and in some markets there was fluctuations and volatility in demand and exchange rates. We manage that from the source. We managed to add a few shipments that's how we've been able to minimize our risk and downward pressure on profitability.</p>
<p>Second also very important is how we optimize our product mix, in various business units we focus on optimization for example focusing on gaming, notebooks, UX series, ZenBook etcetera, these products offer high prices and high margins. They used to account for 10% of our revenue now they account for more than 20% of our revenue so that helped as well.</p>
<p>Our revenue is stable. So the next thing is to increase our operating margin. So looking at the third quarter. We have seen some volatilities in various currencies. For us the most important goal is to focus on our core business to have stable operation of our core business whether it's shipments or quotations we want to have healthy stable operation. And sometimes in our non-op items you see exchange losses reflected but we believe these fluctuations have no impact on our core competitiveness, exchange rates may go up and down but in the long term our competitiveness comes from the positioning of our branding and our cost control and our product mix. So the most important indicator for us is that we do not let exchange fluctuations affect our core business. That's our goal.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>Another question people have been asking about inventory days, your inventory days have been higher than your competitors. And I understand that you have very tight controls on some of the key components. So my question is okay, there are two types of inventories, one is system the other is component and system inventory has to do with your distribution channels. And since the second quarter everybody has been saying that there is too much inventory in European countries and emerging markets. People have concerns and now we see higher inventory days. What's your take on this? What about component? This question is more about the price volatility of components. When you have tighter control on those components you actually have greater risks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Wu</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me start by answering the last the second question. We have always very being very cautious in terms of our components inventory control, I think we have enough sensitivity in this area. Yes our inventory days are longer than our competitors right now. Actually there are two ways of accounting that affects this. First there's the shipping turn of FOB but for us products no way still count has our inventory still count as our assets. These days if you ship PCs by air you will have no profitability. So mostly we do shipping and it takes six weeks for products to go from here to Europe by sea, 42 days. So they still count as our inventory but our competitors see those products on the way as their customers' products, that's one difference.</p>
<p>As for Europe, I monitor Europe on a weekly basis. In June you can look at historical inventory days, you can also look at inventory days from sell through rates and there is a difference between the two. In the past the sales weren't great but now in Europe sell through is improving quite a lot. So in Europe inventory is now nearly back to its normal level. So inventory for finished products is within our control. As for Russia we don't have any shipments between January and May and we have one shipment in June, now it's August. Our customers just received this batch of products and we are seeing pretty healthy sell through. For finished products, all in all we think the entry level is healthy. Back to materials, once again for materials with high price volatility we've axed all of our business units to take tighter controls on those.</p>
<p>When an industry is slow maybe the pricing, the fourth quarter will be lower than that in the third quarter. We have initiated this inventory plan and there is going to be some time difference between the time we launched a plan and the time we see the results. Yes we do still have some inventories but those inventories are items with good competitiveness in the fourth quarter we have a tighter control on commodity items whose prices tend to fall more easily and for items that whose prices do not drop easily we have more infantry.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you give us the breakdown between system inventory and component inventory, a rough figure?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>There are different types of components, there is a motherboard for example, you can have an inventory of six months and you don't have to worry about price dropping so I have looser control on motherboards because prices of motherboards do not drop. As for systems, prices do drop while you're selling. So we have tighter control on that.</p>
<p>We have a rule of thumb for items whose prices tend to drop and whose prices do not drop. We have different guidelines to control them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>A question on smartphone, last year you only had one model so it was simple a price and shipment units and this year you have three models, three chipsets. So of course it's going to be more difficult to control that. So could you tell us the changes in ASP, this year you have the mid end, lower end and entry level models.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jerry Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>With Intel 4 Gigabyte, that's the higher end model. With the launch of Qualcomm chip we only use Intel 4 Gigabyte chips because Intel chips offer a great user experience but we now only use the 4 Gigabyte Intel with different specs but 4 Gigabyte DRAM. This year we expect the ASP will be slightly higher than that of last year, slightly higher.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>People's Bank of China depreciated RMB against the U.S. dollar by a large margin, how is that going to impact your costs and revenue?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Nick Wu</span></strong></p>
<p>They adjusted the RMB exchange rate yesterday. But when it comes to product pricing whether it's the euro or other markets, markets we have business in, it's actually normal to see exchange rates change this much. So this kind of change is not going to have an impact on our pricing or sales in China, of course we will keep monitoring. For another perspective as RMB depreciates it may impact our valuation of RMB assets on our balance sheet. So it will be a onetime mark down. This is something that we will keep in close eye on. We may consider to locking an RMB price or to sell or to buy a contract to control our exposure here, that's something that we’re monitoring.</p>
<p>Operating margin of phones for the third quarter and fourth quarter like we said before when our phone business has a reasonable scale for example 4 million shipments per quarter then we can reach and OVM of 2% to 3%. Looking at the third quarter our shipment target is 6 million. So we can expect the 2% to 3% operating margin. Can we see a better performance? This may depend on our product transition from Intel to Qualcomm. If the transition goes well then we will have room for better profitability.</p>
<p>In the interest of time we will take one last question.</p>
