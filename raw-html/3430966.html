<p><strong>T.Y. Chiu</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, En-Ling. Greetings to everyone. Thank you all for joining us for this quarter’s call. Today I am pleased to share with you SMIC’s second quarter achievement updates and outlook. Despite reported inventory adjustment in the industry. SMIC has achieved two quarters of consecutive growth in 2015.</p>
<p>And we are guiding an additional quarter of growth for the third quarter. SMIC has successfully ramp up new customer products and new technologies to keep our fabs well utilized. The second quarter of 2015 was an excellent quarter we had record-high revenue of $546.6 million as far as record gross margin of 32.3%.</p>
<p>Both shipments and utilization exceeded our expectations, resulting in 7.2% quarter-over-quarter revenue growth. We also achieved a record high profit attributable to SMIC in [second Q] 2015 and a gain in 2Q 2010 from commitment to grant, shares and warrants is excluded.</p>
<p>We believe that this excellent performance compared to industry caution was largely a result of the careful execution of our strategy, which includes the diversification of products, technology and the close partnership with customers. I would like to elaborate the importance of our strategy, which is to differentiate and diversify our product mix to grow our company in a profitable manner.</p>
<p>Our TDs and fabs are generating an increasing array of technology platforms spending from various flavors of 28-nano technologies to tailor made technologies to meet customer’s unique applications. To address our technology progress, 28-nanometer is in</p>
<p>initial RISC production. Our first batch performed well achieving recognition from Qualcomm and mobile phone manufacturers.</p>
<p>This marks a new era of 28-nanometer advanced mobile phone chips manufacturing in China. We target to stand 28-nanometer revenue contribution in Q4 this year. Our target for high-K and middle-K is still the same two to three quarter after poly SiON successfully ramps.</p>
<p>In terms 8-inch differentiated technologies the immense remain strong. We have engaged with new and existing customers over the past few years on a number of new products and anticipate revenue growth from this year and going forward. 27% of our revenue in the first half of 2015 is contributed by new products launched in the last year. With the diversification of our product offerings and technology mix, we have seen a non-handset related labor revenue contribution increasing from 48% in Q1 2014 to 63% in Q2 2015.</p>
<p>Looking at our 12-inch capacity utilization are also strong with 65-nanometer and 40-nanometer running products with diversified applications. To address that strong utilization we continue to improve operating efficiencies and adding capacity in order to grow our business. As mentioned last quarter, Shenzhen become operating in the second quarter of backend bottlenecked metallization helping to boost Shanghai and the Tianjin 8-inch.</p>
<p>We will begin to full line or full slow operation intended this quarter. By the end of this year we target to have a bulk 20,000 wafer per month installed capacity in Shenzhen. As a result of operational efficiency improvement as well as new equipment installation, our Shanghai 8-inch fab increased 2K per month in capacity and our Beijing 12-inch fab increased 1K per month in Q2 compared to the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Our 12-inch fab in Shanghai maintained a 14,000 wafer per month capacity mainly for 40-nanometer and 45-nanometer as well as R&amp;D and amount of 14,000 per moth capacity and 6,000 per month in capable of 28-nanometer production. In August last year, we formed a bumping joint venture with JCET. Equipment has been moving in and we have begun a qualification for our customers product and technology. The qualification is going smoothly and depending on the customer need production is targeted to commence in 2016.</p>
<p>At end of June, we also announced the formation of a new R&amp;D company jointly invested by SMIC and our partners. So R&amp;D company will first focus on developing 14-nanometer FinFET logic technology and will be the China’s most ever IC development in R&amp;D platform. We are very excited to be working with industry leaders to develop leading hedge technology and shortened time to market.</p>
<p>Our China revenue share has continued to increase in the past quarters and in Q2 China region revenue contributed more than half of our revenue for the first time. Not only are we gaining some market share for our China customers, we are also witnessing and helping some of our domestic and local customers gaining IC market share in China. China continues to be largest consumer of IC globally and the largest manufacturing phase for electronics.</p>
<p>In the second quarter China publicized it’s made in China 2015 initiative, which aims to upgrade the manufacturing industry while prioritizing 10 factors one of which is the integrated circuit. With last year’s publication of National IC promotion online at Made in China 2015 initiative it is clear that SIMC if in a key position as the largest and most at advance foundry in China to capture the many opportunity stemming from China.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have achieved a strong first half with high utilization and our expecting growth again in the third quarter. Our good performance as in a result of SMIC careful execution of our strategy, which includes diversification product and technologies. We are cautious about second half given the industries inventory situation.</p>
<p>However we are optimistic about our future given our position in China and our strategy. We stay committed to maintaining sustainable profitability and building value for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. I will now hand the call to Yonggang, for the financial highlight and 2015 Q3 guidance.</p>
<p><strong>Yonggang Gao</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you, T.Y. Greetings to all our listeners. I will now highlight our second quarter 2015 results and our third quarter guidance.</p>
<p>Our revenue was a record high of $546.6 million in 2Q 2015, an increase of 7.2% quarter-over-quarter and increase of 6.9% year-over-year. Gross margin was 32.3% in 2Q 2015 a record high compared to 29.4% in 1Q 2015 and 28% in 2Q 2014.</p>
<p>Profits for the period attributable to SMIC was $76.7 million in 2Q 2015 compared to $55.5 million in 1Q 2015 and $56.8 million in 2Q 2014. Excluding the gain of commitment to grant shares and warrants in 2Q 2010, profit for the period attributable to SMIC was a record high in 2Q 2015. And China-region revenue growing to record high of 51.1% of overall revenue in 2Q 2015</p>
<p>Now looking ahead into third quarter of 2015. Our revenue is expected to increase by 1% to 3% quarter-over-quarter. Gross margin is expected to range from 28% to 30%. Non-GAAP operating expenses, excluding the effect of employee bonus accrual, government funding and gain from the disposal of living quarters are expected to range from $134 million to $139 million.</p>
<p>Non-controlling interests of our majority-owned subsidiaries affected to range from positive $11 million to positive $13 million, which are losses to be borne by non-controlling interests.</p>
<p>I will now hand the call over to Gareth for more details financial commentary.</p>
<p><strong>Gareth Kung</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Gao Yong, and thank you, everyone, for joining us today. I will now comment on the details of our last quarter financial results. On the income statement, revenue increased to $546.6 million in Q2 2015, up 7.2% Q-on-Q from $509.8 million in Q1 of 2015, mainly because of an increase in wafer shipments in Q2 of 2015.</p>
<p>Cost of sales increased to $370.2 million in Q2 2015, up 2.9% Q-on-Q. Mainly because of increase in other manufacturing costs in Q2 2015. Gross margin increased to 30.3% in Q2 2015, up from 29.4% in the previous quarter. The change was mainly due to, an increase in the fab utilization for the quarter.</p>
<p>Operating expenses in Q2 2015 were $115.7 million, an increase of 10.8% Q-on-Q, from $104.4 million in Q1 of 2015. R&amp;D expenses increased to $55.2 million in Q2 of 2015 from $53.5 million in Q1 of 2015, excluding the funding of R&amp;D contract from the government, R&amp;D expenses increased by $6.8 million Q-on-Q to $65.6 million in Q2 2015. Funding of R&amp;D contracts from the government was $10.4 million in Q2 2015 compared to $5.3 million in Q1 2015.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses increased to $52.1 million in Q1 2015, up 22.5% from Q-on-Q from $42.5 million in Q1 2015. Mainly because of first of all start of expenses releasing to two new fab projects and accrued employee bonus in Q2 of 2015.</p>
<p>Excluding the effect of employee bonus accrual, government R&amp;D funding and gain from a disposal of living quarters, non-GAAP operating expenses were $110.9 million in Q2 2015 compared to $99.7 million in Q1 2015. Profit from operation in Q2 2015 was $60.7 million compared to $45.5 million in Q1 2015.</p>
<p>Other income was $11.9 million in Q2 2015 compared to $6.1 million in Q1 2015. Finance cost decrease to $2.4 million in Q2 2015 compared to $5 million in the previous quarter. The change was mainly due to lower the repay from the bank borrowings in Q1 2015 and two more interest expenses were capitalized a part of the positive assets under construction in Q2 of 2015.</p>
<p>Foreign exchange gains increased to $5 million in Q2 2015 compared to 120,000 in the previous quarter, mainly due to an appreciation of RMB against U.S. dollar in Q2 of 2015. Non-controlling interests were $5 million of 22 SMIC attributable profits in Q2 of 2015 compared to $3.9 million in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>Moving to the balance sheet at the end of the second quarter of 2015 cash and cash equivalents increased to $766.2 million in Q2 2015 from $402.4 million in Q1 2015 mainly because of the closing of the private placement to China integrated circuit industry investment fund in Q2 of 2015. If include other financial assets, we had approximately $1.3 billion cash on hand at the end of Q2, 2015 compared to approximately $1 billion in Q1 of 2015.</p>
<p>Our long-term borrowing increased by $46.6 million and short-term borrowings decreased by $73 million, compared to the previous quarter. At the end of Q2 2015, our total debt-to-equity ratio was 28.2% compared to 32.9% in the previous quarter.</p>
<p>In terms of the cash flow, we generated $154.6 million cash from operating activities in Q2 of 2015 compared to $134.3 million in the previous quarter, mainly because of the increase of profit for the period. Cash used in investing activities increased to $170.4 million in Q2 2015 compared to $148.9 million in a previous quarter.</p>
<p>Cash flow from financing activities changed from an inflow of $185.8 million in Q1 2015 to an inflow of $379.4 million in Q2 2015, mainly because of the closing of the private placement to China Integrated Circuit Industry investment fund in Q2 of 2015.</p>
<p>To examine our revenue by application, the communication and consumer segments contributed 49.4% and 37.7% of our revenue respectively in Q2 of 2015 compared to 44.2% and 46.3% respectively in Q1 of 2015. Geographically, revenue from China contributed 51.1% of total revenue. Revenue from North America contributed 32% of total revenue.</p>
<p>And revenue from Eurasia contributed 16.9%. In terms of technology, revenue from 45/40 nanometers contributed 15.3%. Revenue from 65/55 nanometers and 90 nanometers contributed 25.2% and 4.8% respectively. Meanwhile, 0.13 micron and above line width contributed 54.7% of total revenue.</p>
<p>In terms of our overall capacity, total monthly capacity at the end of the second quarter was 255.8000-inch wafers compared to 251.5000 wafers in the previous quarter. The change was primarily due to the increase of fab utilization in our Shanghai 8-inch fab and Beijing 12-inch fab. The overall utilization rate was 102.1% in Q2 of 2015 compared to 99.7% in Q1 of 2015.</p>
<p>We integrate our plan 2015 CapEx for foundry operation to be approximately $1.5 billion. The plan 2015 CapEx for non-foundry operation, mainly for the construction of living quarters, approximately $150 million. The Group plans to rent out or sell these living quarter unit to employees in the future.</p>
<p>I will now hand the call back to En-Ling for the Q&amp;A session.</p>
<p><strong>En-Ling Feng</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Gareth. I’d now like to open up the call for Q&amp;A. As usual, please be reminded to limit your questions to two per person. Operator, please assist. Thank you.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Leping Huang of Nomura. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Leping Huang</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you to taking my question so congratulation for very strong second quarter results. My first question is about your second quarter results, we see that the most of your competitors suffer from the smartphone inventory correction in Q2, but you still have a very strong 10% revenue growth. So I notice that your existing customer of customer from Eurasia will invest strong this quarter.</p>
<p>So can you share any color how you achieved this strong result and is it possible to shifting a revenue mix by the customer and because I think you mentioned 63% from smartphone so what exactly that customer mix and the product mix I think since you are not worry about the future for the smartphone inventory correction, this is my first question.</p>
<p>And the second question is about your 20-nanometer process ramp up so congratulation for the successful commercialization of the 20-nanometer process, but we see that your major customer Qualcomm has facing some inventory correction now so what will be the Qualcomm’s weakness on the 20-nanometer ramp-up on the 20-nanometer process in the coming quarters. And do you have any - or the other customer which can offset the Qualcomm weakness. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you Leping for the questions. I’ll address that your first question is about our performance in Q2 and then TY will address the question on 20-nanometers. I think the - I want to attribute our whole performance for this quarter mainly to the effect that just started from second half last year. We’ve quite actively trying to diversified our full customer base and also our product technologies.</p>
<p>So as mentioned in TY’s script actually our non-handset revenue has been increasing steadily seems the first quarter of 2014 so some of the new application that we have achieved success including for sample smartcard including some of the non-handset communication application for example connectivity, set-top boxes and others. And there have been a very good strategy for us in terms of diversifying our revenue base.</p>
<p>As you know we have been introducing some new technology into production this year including the PSI technology for CIS and also for some of the MEMS applications. So we are I think we are in a pretty good position right now in terms of our diversification of our custom-based and also for our applications.</p>
<p>The other thing is that even through you may see the pull through smartphone growth have started to slow down, but it depends on which customers you are, you are supporting us well and nothing so happened in our case here, some of our customers are doing quite well in the smartphone space despite the overall slowdown in the market. So I think that also explains our performance.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>This is TY, I also want to add a number of comments that to say that despite a fact that smartphone is going through some slowdown, well we see that some of our customers they are increasing in terms of their market share in this smartphone area. So still is a huge, huge market and so when they increase their market share and I think that’s really translate to a very large volume for us.</p>
<p>Secondly, I’d like to talk about the 28-nanometer I think certainly our partner the largest partner has significant customer for us in 28-nanometer, but we also are looking forward to other applications and we have at least four different customers approaching us using our 28 going through [indiscernible]. So I think our 28 volume is still small and from this small basis we can still maintain a reasonable growth in 28.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Randy Abrams of Credit Suisse. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Randy Abrams</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. I want to expand on the last question on the business environment, if you could talk looking forward now for third quarter the application you see holding up to drive your third quarter to continue to grow and could you give a comment on recent toner business just over past month, given what the mix reporting if you’ve seen have the overall order environment whether you seen any pull in or cancellation and how it could impact for fourth quarter continue to hold on?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>We are seeing the - as given in our guidance we are still driving growth in Q3 and I think that the strength that we have seen in Q2 will continue in Q3. Mainly as I mentioned applications in our Smart Card, set-top boxes and others. And then also T.Y. mentioned that you know some of the smartphone customer that we are working with they continue to receive very strong demand in the markets. So, that also translate into more order for us. So, right now we can now come in on Q4 because obviously the market is very dynamic. But overall I think we are cautiously optimistic.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Randy Abrams</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. And I want to follow up on 28, could you talk about now impact, some of those costs are getting held in OpEx ahead of the ramp. So the outlook if 28 say turns on in fourth quarter with the impact on OpEx and cost of goods sold are gross margin as those costs come on. And then if you can provide an update on the Beijing fab, are you still planning that fully for 28 or you could also do some of these 40 or 55 nanometer applications in that fab?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, let me comment on the 28 specifically the Beijing fab. Indeed in Beijing fab we are in from the very beginning to target a transfer of 40-nano technology as well as 28. And right now I think both are getting significant interest from the customers and so we see that Beijing fab is doing pretty well.</p>
<p>This year hardware we have like Gareth had mentioned, our overall CapEx, will remain the same. The foundry related CapEx is $1.5 billion however our B2, we will be now holding our B2 investment to 600,000 wafer per month and because very, very high customer demand we are planning to expand our Fab8 to about 15,000 to 18,000 from the 14,000 per month case. So there is a because of Fab 8 expansion we will generate a much faster capacities to meet our very tight customer demand. So in that case our overall investment CapEx will remain the same.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Randy Abrams</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, and then could you comment on the OpEx and margin implication I guess when the Beijing fab comes online if we should factor more deprecation or shift of cost from OpEx to gross margin?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, our Shenzhen fab will go into commercial production in Q3 and our Beijing 2 will go in the commercial production in Q4 so that will impact somewhat our gross margin. In terms of OpEx we will see the pick up the OpEx in Q3 and it will come down significantly in Q4 because some of the expenses that was capturing OpEx will move to the cost of the line. So we would look at the OpEx to about 20% level excluding the R&amp;D funding and also excluding the stock bonus accrual.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Randy Abrams</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. My final question just on the FinFET recent announcement, but I think talk about the government objective to have FinFET by 2020, but curious your time table I am just the plan for that R&amp;D venture and when you could bring FinFET into commercial production? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Could you repeat the question again?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Randy Abrams</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think R&amp;D project for FinFET there is a more like a national objective to FinFET production by 2020, which was in that original release. But I curious when you are looking at your time line if you think you could pull that in when you target to have the first customers ramp for FinFET or potential the risk production on that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that we believe that it is maybe possible to pull in somewhat, but definitely we have got to be able to going to production by this date 20/20.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Randy Abrams</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay all right thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from Steven Pelayo of HSBC. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Pelayo</span></strong></p>
<p>I am - probably don’t want to answer, but is there any way you can quantify a little bit more specifically your 28-nanometer contributions and kind of ramp over there the next few quarters or so and also maybe you could and quantify which you are suggesting on the shift from OpEx to cogs, if we just assume in the fourth quarter let’s just say everything was flat revenues, which you have the shift. How much basis point impact to gross margins would be we see that’s kind of my first question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Steve, right now our plan is going to start mass production first to Q3 and we will see contribution in Q4, but right now I see is a little bit difficult for us quantify because he will right now products have be qualified but also depending on the market demands for our customers. So we don’t have clear visibility at this point in time.</p>
<p>In terms of the gross margin impact from effect that both [indiscernible] in the production second half the year We have breakeven our Q3 guidance on the gross margin which is reaching from 28% to 30% and then for Q4 right now as I said the markets very dynamic also very much depending on the fab utilization overall. So we will now want to come in on the gross margin for Q4 at this point in time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Pelayo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay we will just a quick follow up I mean if you think about at the wafers that you are going to starting here in next few weeks or is ultimately your fourth quarter revenues do you want just kind of give any general qualitative thoughts on fourth quarter at this point.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, right now we are seeing the strength that we have seen in Q2 carry to Q4. The strength that we have seen in Q2 compared to Q3 and so far for Q4 the indication have been still price strong, but as I say referring now is too early for us to commit on any record new numbers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Pelayo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, last question more of a longer term one, 13 quarters of profitability three years plus congratulations record revenues, record margins congratulations again. The strategy has been sustainable profitability for the time period and you’ve clearly delivered on that. Any new targets that we can talk about, ROE targets, cash flow targets is there some other metric we can focus on beside the above breakeven target?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, our targets are been the same I mean we still have this ROE target that we are trying to achieve 10%, but I’ll also say that we are good about two new factors in Shenzhen and [indiscernible] in the next few months as you can appreciate. I should start two new fabs there would be some cost that will impact our gross margin. But we are still now looking for hard in terms of securing more customers and also introducing more technologies to keep our fab fully loaded.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Pelayo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Fair enough. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from Ken Hui of Jefferies. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Hui</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking my question. First on you 3Q gross margin guidance I guess you hint that part of the decline relative to 2Q is due to the Shenzhen fab if this is true and if we exclude the impact from Shenzhen fab what would be your expectation for 3Q gross margin, that is my first question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, right now our focus is based on the fab, our Shenzhen fab will go into our conversion production in September and the impact based on the estimation of is 100%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Hui</span></strong></p>
<p>So if this is the case I think if we excludes the impact then the 3Q gross margin could be actually very close to 2Q and can we think it’s actually truly a strong indication going to seasonal slow 4Q?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>As I said right now we do see that the order book for Q3 for us is still relatively strong, but as I say the part is very dynamic so I think we just have to wait and see what was the profit for Q4.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Hui</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then my follow-up is regarding your customer mix I think you mentioned earlier that we saw a big jump in terms of your new comings from system and other customers. Is the contribution is mainly from the single largest system customer or it is actually a combination of a diversified group of customers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that right now we are gradually seeing that there a number of system customers set starting to utilize as my teacher service and so it is a diversifying system customers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Hui</span></strong></p>
<p>And they include Chinese and non-Chinese right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, that’s true both are Chinese as well as global system.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ken Hui</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from Daniel Heyler from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my question. Congratulation on the sustained growth on product strategy TY I wanted to ask it look as you had mentioned some key new product areas smartcards and set-top boxes which gives us visibility at the end of the third quarter. Some of your caution relating to the fourth quarter, relating to sustainability of that or is it more the rest of the business the core business that shaky because of inventories just want to get a filling for the visibility and both of those areas, both new products and core business as you look your order book for fourth quarter right now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. As Gareth says our recent weeks still we are seeing the order books remaining relatively stable into the fourth quarter. However we do see the industries in general everyone our industry peers reporting a very cautionary us view and we are also seeing some macroeconomic shift for example that some of the foreign exchange fluctuations that may be effecting to overall IC market. So we need to have sometimes to see a stabilization of these factors. So although we remain cautiously optimistic we still think that yes the visibility in the fourth quarter is not good enough to give a very [indiscernible] coming.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>So yes, so sounds like have very good visibility on new products but you just not sure about the rest of the business because of the macro situation. Is there right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great thank you and then looking at the R&amp;D credits in the second and the property gains look like and then some Forex gains it looks like kind of net benefit relative to first quarter from these to be almost 20 million net benefit which is about which are profit increased by. So I am wondering why the revenues up about $35 million. Some return understand why that the non-excluding these non-credit items why the profits are going up is much and perhaps maybe talk about the third quarter dynamics are where you R&amp;D credits and property maybe playing out again in the third quarter guidance as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>I am not quite sure of your question. Can you repeat it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, you mentioned in your statements in FX gain I think you said was up about $5 million from the previous quarter and then the non - in the disposal gain look like it was about $10 million gain there and then also you bonus the R&amp;D funding we are not about I think $5 million did you say. So you had a $5 million. So if you add those 3 that’s $5 million right there of operating gains. Is that right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Not clear right actually. We cannot record disposal gain in Q2 our foreign exchange or gained about $5 million and then our R&amp;D funding increase about $5 million, but our net income better increase about $20 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay so the one off for more or like $10 million is that right the one off gains?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>If you look at this way yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay got. Okay and then if you look into I know these are tough to predict but should we continue to model maybe some credits going forward end of the third quarter both the R&amp;D credit plus the disposal.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>I think now we mentioned that for our full-year R&amp;D government funding is about $45 million to $50 million I think this is still on topic for us and then maybe booking some disposal gain in the second half of this year from selling some of the [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks and okay. Great and then on the final question here is CapEx 1.5 million likes pretty much back end loaded. So I think you did only 360 million. So much of last do you expect actually spend on a cash flow basis for second half CapEx so the $1.5 billion is the budget and then I'm wondering from a cash flow perspective how much do you think you’ll spend in the second half of the year thanks?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Ken, I think I need to get back to you in terms of - you asked me about CapEx on a cash flow basis. Maybe we can talk separately.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, but remaining on the budget is was it about a billion that’s left in for the second half or what’s the remaining balance on the budget. I think you…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>On the CapEx.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, you spent 370. What was the first quarter spend?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>The spending in the first two quarters is already above $500 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>How much?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>So you are right. About $500 million on the foundry CapEx so far. So you are right the rest obviously will be spent in the second half of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Heyler</span></strong></p>
<p>Excellent. Okay, I will get back in the queue. Thank you.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from Gokul Hariharan of JPMorgan. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gokul Hariharan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, hi congrats on the great gross margin performance. Couple of questions, first of all more book keeping question on the depreciation side. I think if I remember last time you guided for depreciation this year to growth about 3% but when I look at run rate so far. I think it looks much lower than - the run rate seems to be much lower than last year.</p>
<p>Could we have an update on what we expect for full year depreciation this year as well as what kind of step-up should we expect on the depreciation side once Beijing Fab and Shenzhen fab come online? That’s my first question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, okay. We are seeing there will be above $7 million increase in depreciation in Q3 and now it’s above $20 million increase in Q4. Overall for the year the depreciation will be above, will be in the range of 535 to 540, so which is year-on-year is a little bit lower than last year. So that is right now our depreciation forecast.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gokul Hariharan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And should we be expecting that to continue to increase in first half next year given like you answered to Dan question? A lot of the CapEx is coming in second half of this year. Is that fair expectation?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think we should see some increase in depreciation next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gokul Hariharan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Second a little bit of longer term question I think you guys have mentioned some products on the memory side and there is been a lot of talk about China getting involved in memory especially on the NAND Flash side. Is that - is memory something that SMIC would be involved in at some point participate in China’s memory ambitions and what would be the nature of the involvement is it going to be kind of a partnership or you going to be picking a stake in companies like XMC or something like that. Could we talk a little about what your plans are on the memory side? Thanks</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, the memory side we have - and it has in ten years always had a memory after it. And at this moment SMIC has a specialty NAND and Node technology to serve smartphone cold storage applications. This is our main targeted market area and this is we remain focused in the logic applications. At this moment indeed if there are other discussion into going into memory in the large-scale. SMIC is not actively considering it.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from Suji Desilva of Topeka. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Suji Desilva</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, congratulations on the strong results here. With the utilization so strong I am wondering where there any customers you had to put on allocations or any delinquencies in the second quarter that going through that help you with third quarter visibility?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Suji Desilva</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. And my other question was what’s the utilization implied in the third quarter gross margin guidance from the fabs coming online? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Right now we are still - our guidance based on the high 90s utilizations.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Suji Desilva</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay and maybe one last question. China growing so much of the percent revenue it’s Chine going to get to be an even bigger part of the revenue the year or two out here or is there an effort to offset that with non-China customers to diversify would China get to be 60%, 70% of the revenue in the way things - and just curious on your thoughts there? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that for SMIC we have a full intent to be a global technology service company and so it is not intent to pay attention only to China market and so when we ramp up our 28 I think there will be a significant return of our U.S. revenue. In addition, you can see that we are also gaining share in both - gaining market both in Japan as well as in Europe. So indeed there is a steady increase in China revenue as a percentage, but we have not relaxed and in our effort in other area and continue to work diligently and work as hard as possible to gain customers from both U.S. as well as Europe, Japan.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from Szeho Ng of BNP. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Szeho Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning gentlemen and congratulation on the strong quarter. Is it fair to say that our company is in that beneficiary from remedy application and will be happen to get some softness in TVD analysis and I have a follow-up?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we recognized there was a one-off depreciation in ARM B yesterday and given the fact that actually we do have substantial cost which are denominated ARM B and most of revenues are in U.S. dollar so I think this is positive for us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Szeho Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>I see all right, any asset activity and the assets you can share or is it a bit complicated?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m sorry activity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Szeho Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yonggang Gao</span></strong></p>
<p>I think the impact would not be very big because we are now above 20% of our cost are denominated in ARM B.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Szeho Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, all right. Thanks. And then second question regarding the bumping JV is it more or like to handle the captive demand or they are free to approach outside customers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, just JV is wholly actually capable of receiving outside customers although we hope that a significant amount of the capacity was there as might sell own customers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Szeho Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, all right. Okay, thank you very much.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from Rick Hsu of Daiwa Securities. Please ask your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rick Hsu</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning guys and thank you so much for taking my question. Question on the 28-nanometer ramp up I think initially if you guys talk about this certain ramp up in Q4 [indiscernible] should we kind of margin diluted. So how do you guys expect this 28-nanometer to ramp up to reach your corporate average margins, how many quarters that you guys decided to take?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it also depends on the market demand as well. You are right that as we start initial production for 28 will be much dilutive, but we think that as we it was - into economic scale for example in above 20 to 25K the margin should be no get close to our corporate average.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rick Hsu</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes that’s very clear thank you so much. And just another follow up it is 28-nanometer question. The pop on this big customer Qualcomm can you share with us you will be that how many more new customers you guys working with for 28-nanometer rim but especially for maybe when next yield. And in what application in term of product applications how many more customers you guys are working with in what kind applications in after share with us how many - you guys have 28-nanometer?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, indeed we have four or five customers right now already working with us and at this moment the application spends from the TV set-top box and lot of beside the smartphones lot of other consumer application. And so we are seeing a significant diverse applications in our 28 technology. Let me calculate a least right now we have about six NTLs that is running or will be running with the third quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rick Hsu</span></strong></p>
<p>And also tapped out, how many taped out you guys have so far.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">T.Y. Chiu</span></strong></p>
<p>Just I mean the six NTLs, six taped out.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rick Hsu</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes okay. Thank you so much.</p>
