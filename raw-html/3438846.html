<p><strong>Fred Durham</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Whitney. Good afternoon, everyone. And thanks for joining us on today’s call. It’s now over the year since Maheesh, my Co-Founder and I return to CafePress. In that time we have made significant progress toward returning the company to profitable growth by reducing complexity and focusing on the core consumer business, which is CafePress.com.</p>
<p>Over the past few quarters, I have shared our progress and some leading indicators of success. I'm excited to share our second quarter results with you, which I believe show not just indicators, but tangible results of our efforts to stabilize margins and achieve profitability.</p>
<p>Today I will review our second quarter results and touch on the next steps, as we reenergized the company in the second half of 2015 and into 2016. Then I will turn the call over to Garett to review our financial results and we will open the call to questions.</p>
<p>Doing fewer things so that we could focus on doing them better and more profitability has been key to our strategy. Although, it may seem counterintuitive that we could generate more profit with less revenue that’s exactly what we've done.</p>
<p>As a part of the streamlining efforts, we have divested businesses that we have deem to be non-core and for this call the metrics we discussed will be references to continuing operations, which does not include the results of these recent divestitures.</p>
<p>But if we were to quickly remind ourselves of last year's second quarter performance. The full consolidated result including those divestitures had generated an adjusted EBITDA loss of $396,000 on over $51 million of revenue and the continuing operations generated a loss of $1.8 million on revenue of $29 million. By contrast, in Q2 this year, we generated positive adjusted EBITDA of $700,000 on $22 million of revenue. I would like to note that this is the first non-holiday quarter with positive adjusted EBITDA in more than two years.</p>
<p>When Maheesh and I returned, we believe that the lovable core CafePress business was still alive, buried inside the complexity of the consolidated company. We are delivering on our commitment to restore and stabilize profitability through focus, improved operation, smarter marketing and better product mix. Our focus on doing fewer things but doing them better is working.</p>
<p>We continue to stabilize and simplify operations in Q2. After discontinuing roughly 10% of the underperforming products last year, we took a bolder step this quarter and cut out more than 200 additional product types leaving us with the 400 best performing products in our portfolio.</p>
<p>These reductions allowed us to streamline the website experience for our customers, simplify operations and improve our gross margins. We have seen improve customer satisfaction scores, faster production and shipping turnaround, lower scrap rates and improving labor efficiency.</p>
<p>One remaining area that does not align with our future plan is the white label photo and fulfillment business we acquired as a part of EZ Prints in 2012. While we acquired useful relationships and technology from EZ Prints, the remaining business is deemed to be non-strategic and has a lower average order size and margin profile than the rest of CafePress. We intend to dispose this business entering advance negotiation to do so in the near-term.</p>
<p>The annual revenue associated with EZ Prints was about $20 million in 2014 and it did not contribute meaningfully to EBITDA. The planned divestiture of EZ Prints, along with our previous divestitures has significantly simplified the business and gives us the ability to focus on reenergizing the core.</p>
<p>The most significant changes to performance can be attribute to our product mix, pricing and promotion. But we are also making operational improvements. Earlier this quarter we announced cost control initiatives, including transitioning auditor firms and right-sizing our facilities and leases.</p>
<p>In terms of facilities, we plan to eliminate the Atlanta plant as a part of the EZ Prints divestiture, reduce the office space in California by approximately 50% and rescale our headquarters and manufacturing in Kentucky.</p>
<p>With the reestablishment of positive EBITDA, and a far more straightforward and healthy core business, we can now concentrate on stabilizing and growing the topline, optimizing the customer experience and energizing our customer relationships.</p>
<p>As we move into the growth and optimization phases, the Board and management felt it was appropriate to begin to update our team with experienced leaders, who can offer fresh eyes, ideas and perspectives, and in Q2 we welcome three new Board members to our six-person Board.</p>
<p>I would like to thank Doug Leone, Michael Dearing and Diane Irvine for their years of service, dedication and advice on the board of CafePress. At the same time, we're excited to have Ken McBride, Tony Allen and Nick Swinmurn on Board.</p>
<p>Ken is the CEO of Stamps.com. He played a crucial role in the company's turnaround and has since lead it through steady improvements to impressive success. Tony is the CFO of Sypris Solutions and brings extensive financial experience and expertise to our Board. Finally, Nick, the founder of Zappos, is a true pioneer in consumer e-commerce and brings valuable consumer centric experience and creativity to the company. We welcome the additional operational, financial and marketing council.</p>
<p>While we're pleased with the momentum and results so far, we still have a lot of work ahead of us. As we turn our attention to optimizing our customer experience and growing the topline once again, we anticipate an increase in marketing and technology expenses as we invest ahead of the curve. We believe that making strategic investments will kickstart an upward spiral restoring growth.</p>
<p>For the rest of 2015, we anticipate making steady improvements to our customer experience. Q4 will be here soon though and along with it, our seasonal website lockdown. So, while we will be very busy working on growth-oriented plans and projects, we expect 2015 website update and financial improvements to remain modest. We will be focused on traffic and site conversion gains, expanding relationships with our consumer channel partners and investing in our CRM database to improve lifetime value.</p>
<p>We are working on customer segmentation and targeting that will align with our new branding positioning and marketing campaigns that we expect to roll out in early 2016. We believe there are ample opportunities for improvement and look forward to developing and strengthening all aspects of customer acquisitions, retention and growth.</p>
<p>CafePress has a unique position in the industry and a solid value proposition. We’ve been aggressive and proactive, implementing significant changes in a short period of time. We are confident that our acute focus and diligent work revitalizing CafePress will create substantial opportunities for our company, customers and shareholders.</p>
<p>Finally, before I turn the call over to Garrett, I would like to give you an update on the share repurchase program that the company announced in May. In the second quarter, we repurchased close to 0.5 million shares. We believe that reinvesting some of the cash from the divestitures through the share repurchase program, combined with efforts to streamline the business and short the balance sheet represents the Board and Management’s commitment to delivering shareholder value.</p>
<p>And with that, I will turn the call over to Garrett.</p>
<p><strong>Garett Jackson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Fred. I will now review our financial results for the second quarter in more detail. All comparisons will be year-over-year unless otherwise noted. As Fred mentioned, we've given thoughtful considerations to the future of the white label fulfillment and photo printing business we acquired with EZ Prints in 2012.</p>
<p>Those products made up approximately 15% of our 2014 revenue. They had a smaller AOS and do not contribute significantly to the bottom line. After careful evaluations including tax and book value implications, we determined that divesting the business is the best course of action. We expect to conclude any transaction in the next quarter, but we do not anticipate the transaction will unlock significant value on disposal.</p>
<p>As such, we’ve take an impairment charge on the assets based upon the current deal terms. Request for EZ Prints, our results for EZ Prints are reported in discontinued operations for all periods presented. Results from continuing operations include CafePress.com and the remaining portions of our B2B business, which had previously been called CafePress Services. For future quarters, we're renaming CafePress Services as retail partner channels, which consist primarily of our offsite fees in our larger corporate shops.</p>
<p>Let’s turn to our second quarter results. CafePress reported net revenues for the second quarter of $21.8 million, a year-over-year decline of 25%. Revenue from CafePress.com was approximately $18.4 million or 85% of our total net revenue, representing a decline of approximately 30% year-over-year. The topline declines are short-term results of our stabilization strategy as we concentrated on unlocking the most profitable revenue streams and eliminating product and marketing channels with the lowest ROI.</p>
<p>CafePress Services had approximately $3.4 million in revenue or 50% of total net revenue and grew approximately 15% over the same period last year. The improving results were driven by fees from our retail partner channel. Our second quarter adjusted EBITDA was positive $0.7 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA was 3.3% of revenue, a significant improvement from the negative 6.3% a year ago.</p>
<p>This marks the first quarter we have achieved positive adjusted EBITDA outside of our traditional peak season in over two years and it’s the second quarter in a row, we’ve made substantial improvements in profitability on a lower revenue base, both on sequential and year-over-year basis. We're excited to realize the positive impact that our focused efforts have had on our profitability and margins.</p>
<p>I will now review some key financial metrics. I encourage you to consult the tables accompanying our press release for full details. On a non-GAAP basis, our second quarter net loss from continuing operations was $0.5 million or $0.03 per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $2.4 million or $0.14 last year.</p>
<p>Gross margin on a non-GAAP basis was 41.1%, an improvement of over 500 basis points compared to the same period last year. The improvement was driven by lower production costs during the quarter, specifically materials and shipping. The removal of the white label phone fulfillment business from EZ Prints is another towards focusing on a higher margin core business.</p>
<p>On last quarter’s call, we discussed contribution margin. This non-GAAP metric consist of gross profit less variable sales and marketing expenses. We’ve chosen to break contribution margin out in our financial metrics, since we believe is an important indicator of progress in the business. We're pleased to report that we are making significant improvements both sequentially and year-over-year.</p>
<p>Contribution margin for Q2 2015 was $6.4 million or 29% of revenue, an improvement of 1,300 basis points over the previous year and an improvement of 700 basis points over Q1 2015. We believe these results reflect the collective efforts to maximizing marketing efficiency and improve our production processes. We will continue to drive toward a contribution margin that we believe will allow us to scale profitably.</p>
<p>For the quarter, our non-GAAP operating expenses totaled $9.8 million, a reduction of over $4 million versus last year. We continue to be mindful of expenses and are making progress toward rightsizing our cost structure with both short and longer-term initiatives.</p>
<p>Our sales and marketing expense on a non-GAAP basis was approximately $4.1 million, or 19% of revenue. This represents more than 600 basis point reduction over the last year, reflecting the continued impact of our gains in marketing efficiency and lower customer service costs. As Fred mentioned, we anticipate a modest reinvestment in sales and marketing to support our new branding strategy and ramp our marketing campaigns to stabilize the topline.</p>
<p>Our technology and development expense on a non-GAAP basis was approximately $2.8 million, or 13% of revenue this quarter, representing a $0.7 million reduction versus last year. This decrease is driven by cost savings in our web hosting services and realigning our technology teams. We anticipate this line will also increase as we start to staff and invest in our optimization strategies.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses on a non-GAAP basis totaled approximately $2.9 million, or 13% of revenue this quarter. Expenses within G&amp;A were down approximately $0.4 million, compared to last year, mainly attributable to reduction in legal costs.</p>
<p>On a GAAP basis, we posted a net loss from continuing operations of $1.1 million, or $0.06 per fully diluted share. That compares to a GAAP net loss of $4.2 million, or $0.24 per fully diluted share in Q2 2014. Our net loss for the quarter included restructuring charge of $0.5 million. The restructuring charges were predominantly associated with the termination of our California office lease and related employee severances.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2015 we had approximately 400 employees nationally, including approximately 60 employees who were part of the discontinued EZ Prints business.</p>
<p>Within discontinued operations, we posted a GAAP net loss of $7.7 million, or $0.44 per fully diluted share. That compares to a GAAP net loss of $0.1 million, or $0.01 per fully diluted share in Q2 2014. Results from discontinued operations included an impairment charge of approximately $7.3 million from our planned divestiture of the EZ Prints business. We do not anticipate a gain on this divestiture.</p>
<p>Turning to our balance sheet and cash flows, we ended the quarter with $42.7 million in cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments. We significantly improved our free cash flow, which we defined as adjusted EBITDA less CapEx over last year. We had a $0.2 million outflow in the second quarter, compared to $3.3 million outflow for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Our capital expenditures for Q2 totaled $0.9 million, compared to $1.5 million in Q2 2014, driven primarily by lower levels of investment in our planned infrastructure. Our basic and fully diluted weighted average shares outstanding were 17.5 million. As of June 30, 2015, we purchased just under 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a market value of approximately $2.3 million under our share repurchase plan.</p>
<p>To summarize, our results this quarter demonstrate the material progress we're making right-sizing CafePress to build the sustainable, profitable company. We believe our strategic divestitures and simplification measures leave us well-positioned for the future. We're pleased to point to our financial progress as we complete the stabilization phase of our strategy, specifically reduced operating expenses, coupled with improved margins, profitability and capital structure.</p>
<p>Higher margins and more sustainable overall business comes at the cost of lower revenue and volume in the short-term. However, we believe that this is the prudent path that we must take to return CafePress to growth and profitability. We are understanding our customer better and we explore additional growth channels. We intend to invest more heavily into building our brand and enhancing the customer experience.</p>
<p>Operationally, the remainder of 2015 will be used to further refine our infrastructure and continue to execute on right-sizing the company, which may result in additional one-time charges and some higher capital outlays. There are still many challenges we face, but we believe our cash position and improved profitability allows us the opportunity to invest in these areas to provide returns in the future.</p>
<p>I would like to thank the CafePress team for all of their hard work and dedication. We appreciate the support of our investors as we continue to diligently execute our plan to restore the health of the business in a sustainable way that we believe will drive value for our stakeholders.</p>
<p>With that, I will open the call to questions. Operator?</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] We will take our first question from Youssef Squali from Cantor Fitzgerald. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Youssef Squali</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Hi. Thank you. That’s Youssef Squali. So a couple questions I guess. I guess starting with just big picture, Fred. So you’ve sold a number of assets. You disposed of a number of assets, EZ Prints in the last month you announced. As you look at your portfolio of assets, is there anything else that you feel is noncore that you would want to at some point get rid of to again streamline the offering further?</p>
<p>And then as you -- maybe this is question for Garett. The 30% drop year-on-year in CafePress revenues, can you provide a little more color on kind of what went on there between volume, price, etcetera? And just how can you get that to start growing? It seems like 30% is a steep hole to climb out of. And then I have a follow-up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, Youssef. Thank you. So do we have anything else we would like to divest or think as noncore? I think at this point we -- that said, we’ve got through the material stuff. There might be another product or something, but nothing material, nothing interesting. That pretty much completes the list of the companies that we had acquired over the years. And I think we now have a very clear singular focus.</p>
<p>We are now a consumer e-tail company that is selling expressive products to end consumers in a branded way. And so we are very clean, simple company now. So that’s why we are turning our attention from kind of the clean up turnaround phase to the time to grow. So that’s number one.</p>
<p>On the revenue side, I’ll hit a little bit and let Garett kind of chime in as well. Strategically kind of as I talked about product, pricing and promotion, and the variable ad spend areas of the company is where we had the biggest gains and where we’re seeing most of the reason why the revenues dropped and particularly really the pricing and drop in promotion ad spend as had revenue dropped.</p>
<p>What we are focused on internally and why we wanted to introduce metric this quarter is about contribution margins. So internally Maheesh and I, Garett, the teams here are really focused on maximizing contribution dollars, not necessarily percents and the marketing spend and some of our promotional activities were really just that inefficient.</p>
<p>The fact that we are positive in Q2 on an EBITDA basis, I think demonstrates completely how inefficient that was and how the strategy of focusing on that contribution margin. It’s the right thing to find the core business that we want to grow.</p>
<p>Scaling that previous business was a mistake. We would scale their losses. So really that one-third was unprofitable one-third of revenue. That was not profitable revenue. Garett, do you have anything else to add or did I nail it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Garett Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s pretty good answer. Youssef, if you need any other color, that will be no.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Youssef Squali</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yeah. I mean, just I guess as a follow-up to that, as you talked about increase in spending, increase in sales and marketing. Is that something you guys are planning for the second half ahead of the Q4 or do you feel that you're still trying to stabilize the platform and you won't start turning up the marketing spend until sometime next year where the platform is more streamlined. And if that's the case then is the assumption that we will continue to see double-digit decline for the rest of the year for the CafePress brand?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>I’ll let Garett take kind of the year-over-year comps because I’m kind of operating on for a month-to-month point sequential as we cannot really drive it as a turnaround. I think in the second half, what we’re trying to signal is that we think that investments in growth are going to start to outpace gains in contribution margin in the near term as we’re kind of leveling out and finishing that kind of the contraction phase. I think we found a really healthy core. We’re very satisfied with the programs we’re implementing. We like the product mix and we like the quality. We feel like we really found a pretty close to be in that point in that kind of optimizing of the curve, the return on what we are doing.</p>
<p>So now we’re going to look to start to re-expand marketing programs and have kind of a experimental test and tuned budget for marketing to start to grow those programs again. Hope they will warrant intelligently and focus on every marketing program having a return, not just on an average blended basis but every bit of marketing is expected to have contribution margin and in our technologies so we can search and improve the website.</p>
<p>We’re already seeing some honest gains in conversion rate at the card transaction. And we believe there is a lot of opportunity, of course, we are going to have to invest in that before we get the releases out. And so we’re going to start to see technology, engineering and marketing budget extend head of the growth rate. But we think additional profit in contribution margin gained real dollars are going to account for now, scaling this business and starting to grow it again.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Garett Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>And Youssef, I will just add to that a little bit. Q2 came in on the contribution margin around 30% of revenue and we are targeting that between 25% and 30% through the rest of the year using some of, as Fred said, some of the test and tuned opportunity to see if we can find some of those growth opportunities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Youssef Squali</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And next we’ll take Brian Fitzgerald from Jefferies. Please go ahead sir.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Fitzgerald</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks guys. I want to get your -- first of all on the EZ Prints. You had mentioned who you sold it to or was it a competitive prices -- processor or the price there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. We did run through a process and it was competitive with more than one company in there. Originally, we have not completed the deal yet. So we don’t have any announcement to make there so. But we are expecting to have something to close this quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Fitzgerald</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then maybe follow-up on international, can you give us sense for how the performance was in the quarter. Any progress made in terms of developing local partnerships, is this not going to be a priority?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>I’ll take the strategy and priority part and let Garett fill in the numbers here in just a second. In terms of focus and priority, I feel like United States is still the best consumer market in the world. And as we turned around, we were very far from saturating this market. And given that our domestic business is still roughly 10 times bigger than the international. I expect the rate of return on our investment intention to be about 10 times better in the divested market than internationally.</p>
<p>Over the course of the last year, covered over foreign language, websites, we have kept three other English speaking websites up. We focused on -- each of those has a local production partner. So we have local production for each of those three countries, Australia, Canada and U.K. We’re happy with the performance that we have. We have tuned those while they are growing faster than the core CafePress site over a year ago.</p>
<p>They were also growing unprofitably. So we have tuned their margin that those are also contributing to the sorts of rates and expectations that we would have to the rest of the business. So they have trumped in this hotline I think even more than core business has. We’re probably not going to invest heavily in 2016 in those but we are going to keep them alive because we think they do have future. We deserve bigger opportunity in front of us in near-term in terms of number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Garett Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Brian, just kind of follow up on the numbers, last year, Q1, Q2 that was roughly around 15% to 16% of revenue. This year it's about 12% both quarters, Q1 and Q2 and we don't anticipate that changing much off of that 12% number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Brian Fitzgerald</span></strong></p>
<p>Very good. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And we'll take our next question from Dan Weston with WestCap Capital Management. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Weston</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Hi. Good afternoon guys. Thanks for taking the questions and congratulations on what looks to be a solid turnaround in progress. In terms of the restructurings, I think I was going a little too fast. Did you go over the some of the restructuring on your office facilities please and then on top of that once these latest rounds of restructuring are completed -- what -- including the divesture of EZ Prints, what the operating model will look like and headcount will look like?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Garett Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. I’ll start with the facilities. We are kind of cutting the facility footprint in California by about half and we will be moving to more portable space out here. The EZ Prints facility is -- will be going with that particular divestiture and that's around, I believe, 65,000 square feet of space or so down there. And then in Kentucky, we are looking to sublease the portion of the space that we have maybe about 150,000 square feet in our facility. And looking at other potential space for some of our corporate operations, which won’t be a significant, maybe about 25,000 square feet. But overall we believe that the surge in 2016 reduced our overall OpEx, maybe $300,000 to $500,000 or so.</p>
<p>Headcount, our headcount is pretty close to where it needs to be. We’re around 340 employees and that will likely be the number that needs to stay after the EZ Prints Group, which is around 60 employees. So that number is pretty close where it needs to be. There maybe few additions as we mentioned some of the technology but it won’t be significant.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Weston</span></strong></p>
<p>Very good. I appreciate that. And in terms of -- Fred, I think in your opening comments when you were talking about the divestiture of EZ Prints, I do want to make sure I got it right. Did you say you do not expect a significant cash infusion from the sale or maybe you can talk to that again please?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I don’t. The company’s topline is shrinking and it is EBITDA neutral to negative. And we do not anticipate any significant measurable return from that sale -- the sale -- the main advantage of selling EZ Print into this and it really is the regaining of focus to CafePress. But in terms of the remaining asset that we didn’t transition over, not lot of gain yet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Weston</span></strong></p>
<p>I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Garett Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Just that’s reflected somewhere in the impairment charge that you see that we took. There’s about $7.3 million impairment that we took on assets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Weston</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Understood. Thanks for clearing that, Garett. Just last couple cleanups -- by the way Garett, do you have your current NOL positioned handy?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Garett Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s around $12 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Weston</span></strong></p>
<p>Around 12 million left?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Garett Jackson</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Weston</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then finally now that you are in process of divesting the last division that you need to, will that in and of itself complete your total strategic alternatives review or is that still ongoing post the divestiture?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. We’re done with that. We have a singular consumer focus and we’re really excited to be running that core simplified business. You know that I've been speaking about the last year. That’s where we’re done buying selling for the time being.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Dan Weston</span></strong></p>
<p>Very good. Thanks very much for answering the question, guys and congratulations.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>At this time this does -- we will take Aaron Kessler from Raymond James. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Aaron Kessler</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thanks, guys. Couple of questions, just on the gross margin improvement year-over-year, can you just talk a little bit through the drivers of that, was that primarily mix shift that you talked about earlier, any other drivers of that? Also I noticed it looks like you have a number of election gear on the website, how you will focus, I think, that will be going through election season here and then a couple follow-ups. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. The gross margin was driven, I would say, primarily by pricing, next by product mix. Again, we got rid of a lot of the underperforming products that had low margins. And finally, we are making significant gains in our production facility, a far more efficient production.</p>
<p>We’re changing workflow and investing there as well. So really kind of production, pricing and product mix, all contributed significantly to that gross margin enhancement. And that it's worth noting all, not just a little bit that we do have kind of these two channels now where we have direct CafePress.com, which has kind of a gross revenue, and then sales and marketing kind of taken out in that bucket.</p>
<p>So we do have that significant growing retail channel partner segment where fees that we owe to those channel partners are netted out at the top, which really makes -- puts pressure on the gross margin, that’s why we’re looking at the contribution margin because that balances those two things out.</p>
<p>These are the best gross and contribution margins the company has ever had. And so we came in to the business same way. We can top our peak performance in 2012, I’d really satisfied and I’m really satisfied. We vested our numbers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Aaron Kessler</span></strong></p>
<p>Garett, it seems like…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>And elections, sorry, if we have your election season, I’ll hit that. So election, yeah, election just popping-up. We love elections. I love trump quite a bit. Almost as good as Sarah Palin and Bernie Sanders is great as well.</p>
<p>So and just -- I hope if it bodes well for next year, it is kind of a one time event. It’s not really some to based into the model. Primary people get excited. They don’t tend to buy a lot, because you have to keep feeling off bumper stickers and replacing, and can it just come out, but there is certainly a lot of activity and interest.</p>
<p>And as people identify with politics and the identity around politics and the issue is really bright this year. I’m really excited because it’s a great way for us to introduce our brand to customers, acquire customers and really embrace that sort of connection and tribal identity and the stuff that, of course, really about. So I think it’s an exciting opportunity for us in the coming year with our new brand.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Aaron Kessler</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. And could you just remind us where mobile is running today as a percentage? And the, secondly, CapEx, what do you think kind of normalized level of CapEx is going forward here?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Mobile revenue is about 19% of our total revenue in Q2. It’s down around 1% year-over-year. And then, second question on CapEx.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Aaron Kessler</span></strong></p>
<p>CapEx.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Fred Durham</span></strong></p>
<p>We ran a little bit light on CapEx probably first couple of quarters, we expected to be little heavier in the second part of the year, but still remain within that 5% revenue threshold that we’ve been to be at for the last few years.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Aaron Kessler</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>At this time, this does conclude our question-and-answer session. I’d like to turn the conference over to Fred Durham for any closing and additional remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Fred Durham</strong></p>
