A copy of our earnings press release with supporting schedules is posted to our website, www.paragonoffshore.com under our Investor Relations page. For those of you who would like the release in PDF format, we’ve posted that and following the call, we’ll post a couple of slides that reconcile some of the non-GAAP metrics we may discuss on the call today, to GAAP, as well as a summary of our guidance.</p>
<p>Before I turn the call over to Randy, I would like to make you aware that we will be making forward-looking statements today. Any other statements that are not historical facts including statements related but not limited to financial guidance, market expectations and future plans are forward-looking statements that involve certain risks, uncertainties and assumptions.</p>
<p>These include but are not limited to risks associated with the general nature of the oil and gas industry, risks associated with the operation of Paragon as a publicly traded company, actions by regulatory authorities, customers and other third parties, and other factors detailed in the risk factor section of Paragon’s registration statement on Form 10 and Paragon’s most recent annual report on Form 10-K, and Paragon’s other filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.</p>
<p>Should one or more of these risks or uncertainties materialize, or should underlying assumptions prove incorrect, actual results may vary materially from those indicated. Paragon disclaims any duty to update the information presented on this call.</p>
<p>And now, I’d like to turn the call over to Randy Stilley, Paragon’s President and Chief Executive Officer. Randy?</p>
<p><strong>Randy Stilley</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Lee, and good morning. And with me today are Steve Manz, our CFO; and Andrew Tietz, Senior VP of Marketing and Contracts. As usual, I’ll provide some opening remarks, Steve will follow with some comments on the quarter and provide some guidance; and we’ll conclude with Andrew who will provide some commentary on the offshore drilling market. We will close with Q&amp;A.</p>
<p>Last night, we reported results that were well ahead of expectations. Operationally, we continue to perform well with unpaid downtime of less than 2%. Costs were below the low end of our guidance, thanks to our focused cost control efforts, and as Steve will discuss further, we’ve been successful in some internal restructuring that provided a significant tax benefit in the second quarter, and we expect it will continue for some time. </p>
<p>There is no doubt that we are in the midst of one of the most challenging macro and industry environments we’ve experienced in many years. There is enough data available to illustrate this on comfortable reality, and we are not going to rehash that information on the call. The fact is that while we believe lower capital spending, reduced activity levels, natural decline rates, and increased global oil demand will lift commodity prices at some point, oil prices are likely to remain challenged for some time to come.</p>
<p>Even when prices begin to recover, the offshore drilling space faces an oversupply of both floater and jackup assets that could depress utilization and day rates for several years. The question for Paragon is what can we do to navigate these turbulent waters and emerge stronger on the other side.</p>
<p>Last quarter, I outlined five near term priorities for Paragon. First, I said that we needed to reduce our operating cost and capital expenditures to preserve contract drilling margins and liquidity. We’ve done so bringing OpEx below our most recent guidance. We are also updating our guidance today to reduce full-year CapEx spending to below $200 million for 2015. To be sure, stacking rigs has helped lower CapEx and OpEx, but we are keenly focused on taking additional costs out of the system as quickly as possible in an environment that could be lower for longer.</p>
<p>Next, we said that we were going to refinance the debt from the Prospector acquisition. Our recently closed sale leaseback delivered on that promise providing $300 million of financing at attractive rates and enhancing Paragon’s liquidity. Adding the net proceeds from the sale leaseback to our cash and revolver availability as of June 30 gives us a pro forma liquidity of approximately $725 million and reduces our net debt.</p>
<p>Third, we told you we had aggressively pursued new contracts. Our marketing team has done a great job in leveraging customer relationships, and our record of operational excellence is to secure contracts in the North Sea, Middle East, and Africa. In one of the few drilling contractors, there has been success recently and we are winning work with older standard rigs rather than newer high spec rigs. Of course, we can’t create work. Some of our customers suffered from severely reduced budgets, commodity prices that are simply too low to make drilling opportunities economic or other internal issues that have resulted in reduced activity. But where we have opportunities, we are more than competitive and we’ll continue to be aggressive in securing new work for our rigs.</p>
<p>Fourth, we talked about strengthening our balance sheet to position Paragon for the long term. Many of you have asked what our intentions are for the funds raised through the sale leaseback. We have a range of possibilities and we are not prepared to provide you with an answer today. However, we are carefully analyzing our options, and when the time is right, we will announce our intentions. For now, I won’t emphasize our increased liquidity and the flexibility that it potentially provides.</p>
<p>Fifth, we said that we would maintain our focus on being the high quality, low cost, safe and reliable drilling contractor. We believe our revenue efficiency and our ability to secure additional work in this difficult environment speaks to our success in this area. This is a key differentiator for Paragon, and sophisticated customers realize that it is not just about how new an asset is, rather it’s the people and the processes of how [indiscernible] assets dictate success. Paragon has some of the best of both.</p>
<p>During the quarter, we also reached an agreement with the SWS shipyard to delay delivery of Prospector 6 until April 2016. By doing so, we maintain our optionality to bringing the rig into our fleet if we are able to secure an attractive contract and if we are able to secure financing against that contract. To be clear, we do not intend to use cash on hand or draw on our revolver to take delivery of the rig, particularly one without a very good contract. And while we haven’t reached agreements on Prospector 7 or 8 yet, we believe we will be able to come to some kind of accommodation on those units at the appropriate time.</p>
<p>Despite our successes, our equity has struggled. You are aware that we recently received a notice of non-compliance from the NYSE regarding our share price and its 30-day trading average. As we said in our recent release, we intend to take steps to cure on our compliance within the allotted timeframe. There is no denying, it’s a very difficult time in the industry and it’s likely to remain so for the foreseeable future. At Paragon, we are focused on controlling what’s within our power to control and managing through the rest. We have an experienced management team that’s seen [indiscernible] before and I want to reiterate that Paragon is planning for the long term.</p>
<p>I’m now going to turn the call over to Steve to let him run through our financial information before Andrew discusses the markets and then we’ll open it up for questions.</p>
<p><strong>Steve Manz</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Randy, and good morning to everyone on the call. We had another really solid quarter. We ended up with approximately $158 million in EBITDA, which is slightly lower than the $167 million in the first quarter. Despite the fact that our contract drilling service revenue were lower versus the first quarter, it’s a testament to our ability to manage our cost and to react to market changes. </p>
<p>Here are some of the second quarter highlights. We had contract drilling service revenues of $363 million, which is about 9% lower than the first quarter. A big piece of that was the lower revenue from Mexico as well a couple of contract rollovers in the North Sea. Our second quarter contract drilling service costs of $197 million were about 12% lower than the first quarter and just below the bottom end of the guidance we gave in May. Our SG&amp;A expenses of $13.7 million were down about 11% from the first quarter and was in the middle of the range we provided in the last quarter.</p>
<p>The biggest outlier in the second quarter results was the tax provision. As you remember, I indicated that we expect to remit overall effective tax rate for the year around 20% or lower. But in the second quarter, we completed an internal restructuring initiative, some of which was related to the restructuring of the Prospector entities that we acquired last year, and in addition we also expect to have losses in some of our jurisdictions, predominantly in Mexico. All of our rigs in Mexico are effectively taxed in the U.S. which is one of our highest tax jurisdictions because we have been stacking rigs in Mexico, we expect to pay less U.S. taxes in 2015.</p>
<p>So the combination of the restructuring initiatives and our expected loss on Mexico allowed us to book a discrete benefit for the second quarter and a reduction of our effective tax rate for the full year. We now expect that our 2015 ETR to be close to zero. But to be clear, a tax rate of 0% does not mean that we don’t have to pay cash taxes. As you know, in some of this jurisdictions we operate such as West Africa, we will have to pay deemed profit taxes meaning the taxes are charged as a percentage of the revenues. This year, we expect that we will have to pay about $30 million in tax payments but the cash taxes will be offset with various deferred tax benefits. So our ETR will be approximately 0%.</p>
<p>Our second quarter CapEx was approximately $62 million. Most of this was for couple of projects that we had to finish for customer contracts. Fortunately, most of the projects are essentially complete and we expect the CapEx for the third and fourth quarter will be lower. The second quarter net cash flow from operations was $97 million. We ended the quarter with $112 million in cash and approximately $343 million of unused capacity on our revolver. So now that we received $292 million proceeds on the Prospector sale leaseback, our liquidity position is very substantial.</p>
<p>Our total debt was less than $2 billion and as of June 30, our leverage ratio was 2.57 times EBITDA. Accounts receivable balance was $356 million. We are still getting a regular payment from Petrobras and Pemex. We are taking down a couple of our receivables from a customer in India and one in West Africa, but we are vigorously pursuing collection from these customers. Obviously we are doing everything we can to bill and collect as quick as possible.</p>
<p>And so before I hand it over to Andrew, I’ll give you some high level guidance for the rest of the year. In May, we said the biggest level in our forecast is Mexico. Since then, the outlook in Mexico is much clear. We will probably down to one rig later this year which makes our cost easier to predict. Based on that, we expect the following. Our full year contract drilling expenses will be in the range of approximately $780 million to $800 million, down from the $810 million to $835 million in our last call, with approximately $180 million to $200 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p>We expect depreciation expense should be $360 million to $380 million for the full year, similar to what we provided in the call in May, and $85 million to $95 million in the third quarter. Our corporate SG&amp;A should be approximately $55 million to $60 million for the full year, with approximately $13 million to $15 million in the third quarter.</p>
<p>Our interest expense will be approximately $120 million to $130 million for the full year and approximately $30 million to $35 million in the third quarter. As I mentioned a few minutes ago, we expect our ETR will be 0%, but we will pay approximately $15 million in cash taxes for the rest of the year. </p>
<p>Finally, we expect our annual CapEx budget to be approximately $190 million to $200 million, down from the $200 million to $220million we guided previously, with $40 million to $50 million in the third quarter. We have not finalized our CapEx budget for 2016 yet. Sufficed to say that the 2016 CapEx budget will be lower than 2015. </p>
<p>So with that, I'll turn it over to Andrew. Andrew?</p>
<p><strong>Andrew Tietz</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Steve, and good morning and afternoon to everyone. There is no doubt that we’re in the throes of severe downturn in the offshore drilling business. Over the past nine months, it certainly feels as though many of the generally accepted assumptions that have shaped our industry the past 15 years have been abandoned and replaced by harsh mandates that are often unilateral and exclusively punitive for the drilling contractor. </p>
<p>At Paragon, we have made the best of this difficult situation and have been successful in securing more than our fair share of new contracts as I will expand upon later. Last quarter, continued to be slow on the contract award front with 1.8 billion of new jackup contracts awarded to the industry. This was up from the anemic 800 million of new contracts awarded in Q1. Thanks to a number of contract awards in the UAE.</p>
<p>We would like to highlight the fact that 61% of the 1.8 billion of new contracts were awarded to standard specification jackups last quarter. This marks the third quarter in a row that standard specification jackups have been awarded a greater percentage of work than high specification units and supports our belief that there continues to be demand especially in the slow commodity price environment for standard specification jackups.</p>
<p>On the floater front, only $900 million of new contracts were awarded in the second quarter versus 1.4 billion in the previous quarter. In addition, several contracts were early terminated and incapacity to what was already an oversupplied market. Many in the industry continued to point to rig attrition from companies such as Paragon as the cure to an oversupplied market. While this theory may hold true from floaters considering the carrying cost of these asset, we don't see this as a quick fix for the jackup market, many of our competitors are counting on.</p>
<p>We continue to secure new contracts for our jackups often at times when competing with high specification is jackups. The vast majority of our jackups are well maintained, fit for purpose, and crude with the experienced component personal. We have no plans to scrap our jackup fleet for the benefit of our competitors or newbuild speculators.</p>
<p>I’ll now brief you on selective markets around the world where we operate. We’ll begin in the Middle East; we're following a successful backlog build in the first quarter. We were able to secure four years of additional backlog with contract extensions on the Dhabi II and the B152. While the contract extensions were at lower rates, our margins on these two contracts on a percentage basis are as good as any in the world.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Total did exercise early termination for convenience on the L1115 in Qatar. This rig has performed exceptionally well in the Al Khalij field the past 14 years. Total did not terminate for performance related issues, they simply needed a break in their program and used the early termination clause as previously agreed when the contract was signed a number of years ago.</p>
<p>India continues to be another bright spot in the offshore drilling business. ONGC currently has tenders out for 18 rigs and we anticipate additional tenders for three more rigs. In total, ONGC has requirements for 13 jackups, 2 DB, and 6 more floaters. This represents an incremental increase of 7 jackups and 2 floaters.</p>
<p>While the rates will be low, contract terms are lengthy and is refreshing to see the incremental demand. Work continues on the L1112 also known as the Noble Ed Holt. Due to a protracted contract dispute with Jindal, we were prohibited from exporting a rig prior to the onset of the monsoon season.</p>
<p>As a result, we are performing contract preparation work in a shipyard in India as opposed to the UAE with the contract commencement deadline looming. Situation in Mexico continues to be disappointing. In fact, in our last call, one investor characterize Mexico as lawless. A comment we repeated but regret doing so. Of course, it is not lawless in Mexico as the clear and transparent process around the recent round one offshore auction illustrates very well, but it has been frustrating from our perspective. </p>
<p>Several drilling contractors including Paragon have had their contracts arbitrarily terminated and/or day rates reduced as Pemex struggled not only with positioning itself to compete under the new energy reforms, but also the impact of low oil prices on their operational budget. The rig terminations and/or day rate reductions have not been limited to stand specification rigs however. </p>
<p>Nevertheless, we continue to believe that Mexico is home to world-class offshore reserves and incremental capital will migrate to the region, resulting in additional rig demand. It’s not a matter of if, but when. We also continue to believe our jackup, as has been the case for the past 24 years, are a cost effective solution for the shallow waters in Mexico for Pemex, as well for potential newcomers.</p>
<p>It’s important to note that while we’re showing these rigs are stacked in the U.S. Gulf of Mexico, we have gone to great lengths to stack these rigs in such a way that we can easily and quickly turn them around and mobilize them back to Mexico or elsewhere when incremental demand materializes.</p>
<p>Recently, Petrobras announced their latest five-year business plan. They plan on reducing their term capital expenditure budget by 40%. As a result, they have terminated or amended a number of drilling contracts with our competitors. Petrobras has indicated to us that they may contest the term of our drilling contracts for the DPDS2 and the DPDS3 in connection with the length of prior shipyard projects relating to when those rigs were upgraded.</p>
<p>We believe the contractual language supports our position and intend to do whatever is necessary to defend our contracts. As of June 30, 2015, Paragon’s total backlog was 1.587 billion. The DPDS2’s backlog was a 199 million and Petrobras is speeding approximately 85% or 520 days of this backlog.</p>
<p>The DPDS3 backlog was 294 million with Petrobras disputing approximately 48% or 380 days of its backlogs. I do want to stress that the dispute is not related in any way to the performance of the units and we continue to discuss this matter with Petrobras to try and find a solution.</p>
<p>In the North Sea, we were able to secure additional backlog of almost 2.5 years on two rigs. This is impressive and what could be shaping up as one of the more difficult jackup markets in 2016. Over the past four full quarters, Paragon making up only 19% of the active supply has secured just under half of all new non-region jackup demand in the North Sea.</p>
<p>In summary, there’s no doubt the offshore drilling business is in a bear market. However, we have been successful in securing several meaningful contract extensions this year and will do what is necessary to protect our market share going forward. One analyst recently described a competitor as punching above their weight and given our success in securing backlog over the past year, we think we could make that claim as well.</p>
<p>With that, I will turn the call back over to Lee.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Ahlstrom</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Andrew. And John, we are now ready to take some questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. We now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] And our first question is from Lucas Dahl from ABG.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lucas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good morning guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning Lucas.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lucas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, I was just wondering -- your comment regarding the competitive situation in the tenders where you have been fairly successful bidding against the new rigs or some of them are even new builds, can you sort of describe the main factors that are the reason for your success, is it price, is it operations, is it track record, could you just wrap it up a little bit?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it is actually fairly simple, it is all three. We are very competitive on price, but we don’t always have to be the lowest in price. Our ongoing operations and prior experience with a lot of our clients give us a leg up against some of our competitors and in a lot of cases we are the incumbent working for these same people, and it is very difficult to displace us in that environment because of our operating history.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lucas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Alright, okay good. And then on Prospector 6 that you mentioned you differed delivery and you are saying you don’t intend to use any of your revolving facilities on taking delivery. What kind of contract would you need in order to be able to fund the bullet yard installment? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I think one, first we have to find a contract that we think is attractive, and I would hate to speculate on what it is because it is going to be a combination of day rates and term, and then we need to be assured that we can get adequate financing for the rig. I don’t think right now we would want to actually use any of our existing capacity to put a rig into service, but I think if you just do kind of back of the envelop calculations, assume that the rig is $200 million if that is the cost, and there potentially could be some room to negotiate on that, we don’t know yet, it is too early to tell, but in that kind of an environment you are typically going to need something in the high 100s to make that work. It depends on whether we can get financing in place for that, and I think the relationship that we are developing with the number of banks just like we did on the sale lease back of the first two Prospector rigs could be an option for us if we have an attractive contract.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lucas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just one last one. The issue that you mentioned with Petrobras has it sort of resurfaced recently or has it been going on for some time, and are your rigs sort of the only one being targeted?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Our rigs are definitely not the only ones being targeted, and in fact Petrobras has already released a number of rigs over the past 12 months. We’ve had ongoing discussions with them for several months now about potentially some blend and extend options, some combination of backlog options, we’ve worked with them on a number of different options. We just haven’t really reached an agreement with them on anything yet. So, I think there is a potential that we are not going to be able to.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lucas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Alright. Okay thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Howard Amster from Ramat.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Howard Amster</span></strong></p>
<p>Hello. The first quarter you bought back bonds, I think in the 70 price, just wondering what this increased liquidity, why they are haven’t been any on bond purchases. I am talking about your 22’s and 24’s. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. So, so why no bond purchases since the first quarter. That is correct. I think like Randy said, we were fortunate right now that we have cash and liquidity. Right now, I think it is going to be kind of like an overall kind of strategy, like how we are going to deploy the cash and liquidity from it, but also what kind of a long-term plan to kind of manage our balance sheet and part of our capital structure. So, we decided that in the second quarter, there is no need to make any decisions on there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>It is worth noting as well that the trading activity in the bonds is very thin, and our ability to acquire additional bonds out in the open market, it wouldn’t really be material to our operations or our balance sheet.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Tietz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, for example you are seeing probably quotes on the boards of bonds in the 30s, but that – again as Randy said, there is very little liquidity there. So, you are not seeing significant number of trades to give those quotes. It maybe one trade every couple of days that actually causes that to happen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Howard Amster</span></strong></p>
<p>I would just add though that over , let’s say a three-month period to buyback $150 million worth of bonds is not impossible and that would be meaningful, that’s a $10 million a year interest rate savings and a decent cut down in the debt, so I guess that’s why I asked the question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz </span></strong></p>
<p>Tell you what, if you can bring us a $150 million of bonds, we’ll talk about buying them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Howard Amster</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, I’ll talk to my broker about it and thank you very, very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz </span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Howard Amster</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz </span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And we have a question from Alex [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, it’s actually [indiscernible], how are you guys doing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Good Wilber [ph], how are you?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Good. I wanted to just kind of clarify your lending facilities. I guess what I’m trying to figure out is, you currently have full access to your bank lending facilities, can you discuss what the terms are under which that you can borrow or couldn’t borrow on those facilities and when that expires?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>It actually doesn’t expire. As long as we’re in compliance with our covenants, we have full access to the revolver.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And the key covenant there is a leverage covenant right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>What’s the number on that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>4x.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So 4x and that compares to the 2.6 that you guys reported this quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>It is going to favor leverage covenant is based on kind of the trailing 12 months we’ve had a couple of good quarters so that that’s helping us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Alright and then I guess two more questions. First, with respect to Mexico, are there any new contracts that are being awarded or is there any plans or expectations that they’re going to replace some of the rigs that they’ve terminated because by my count I think Mexico had 52 shallow water rigs operating at this time last year and I think they’re down 20 from that number, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Tietz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think the number’s approximately towards the end of July in the high-30s is the number of jackups working down there. We continue to view Mexico on positive light. As I said in my prepared remarks we think it’s a matter of when not if the incremental demand materializes. Mexico is the world’s tenth largest producer of oil and whole approximately 1.1 billion barrels of oil reserves and 75% of Mexico’s production is found in the offshore in the shallow waters in the Bay of Campeche. So, we think the opportunity is there. Yes, Pemex is the way out of their problem is to drill and as I said 75% of it’s in shallow waters and we think that the capital is eventually going to find its way back into Mexico and it’s going to present opportunities for our rigs and others.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So, is Pemex awarding new contracts or taking bids on anything new or is the expectation that the private sector is going to be the avenue for financing new rig contracts in Mexico?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Tietz</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it’s largely going to be that the private sectors is what they’re counting on at this point and that’s going to be through a variety of avenues. No, they’re not actively out right now looking for additional capacity with jackups there. There are number of conversations going on about what the future is going to look like and what the opportunities might be, but there’s nothing formal at this point.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Alright, great and I guess the last question that I had for you guys has to do with free cash flow, the expectation for 2015 is that you guys are free cash flow positive after debt service, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And does that turns in 2016 based on what you guys noted there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>I think that’s a question whether we’re going to give guidance on 2016 which we can’t do that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Alright, thank you very much, appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lee Ahlstrom</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Wilber [ph]. This is Lee, we had one question that did come in over e-mail and I thought we would just go ahead and address that. It was the question about the change in operational cash flow in the Q2 versus Q1 and what drove that and so I’ll turn that over to Steve and let Steve answer that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, Lee, the biggest driver for that is that we had a huge collections of AR in the first quarter. As you recall, we had a very large amount of outstanding receivables from both Pemex and Petrobras. They got caught up in first quarter. The kind of collections in the second quarter basically we are just giving the ongoing regular whatever we are kind of expecting from it. The other piece of that is that we have to make some tax, we made some large payments like for taxes and also we paid our insurance. So combination of actually paying that plus lower AR collections that’s the biggest driver from it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks, Steve.</p>

<p>We had one more come in online. Can we talk about the labor situation and what we are seeing there, particularly thinking about accruing up on Prospector 6?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I’ll address that. From a labor standpoint, we’ve had to terminate a number of very qualified and experienced employees they were working for us around the world over the past few months. We stay in constant contact with those people on kind of a biweekly basis to make sure that they are still available to go back to work. So if there is an opportunity to put Prospector 6 to work, we won’t have any difficulty at all accruing that very quickly with experienced people.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lee Ahlstrom </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks, Randy.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And we did have a question from Lukas Dahl from ABG.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lukas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. Thanks guys. I just wanted to follow-up on your comment you made on India. Could you just repeat the number of rigs that are being required and what time do you expect those conflicts to be awarded?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Currently they have tenders out for 18 rigs and we anticipate additional tenders for three more rigs. So in total, ONGC has requirements for 13 jackups, 2 DP and 6 more floaters, and this represents an incremental increase of 7 jackups and 2 floaters. So there are a number of tenders as I said and they have different closing date but all of these tenders are in the process with the exception of three that haven’t been awarded yet and they are in various stages of being submitted on the drilling contractors part and some are being reviewed, have already been submitted and being reviewed by ONGC and a several of it are still not – we have not submitted our proposals yet. So just monitoring the situation there but that’s quite a bit of incremental demand in India.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lukas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>So do you think that the initial ones could be awarded in the second half of this year? Or do…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Steve Manz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lukas Dahl</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Alright. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] We have nothing further. I’ll turn it back over to you. We did have one, sorry, from Rajul Aggarwal from Marathon Asset Management.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rajul Aggarwal</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my question. Could you just expand on the Petrobras situation as to what possibilities have been exhausted and what potential outcomes could be? It’s a material news you’re giving us on the call, so is it similar?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. I’ll just give you a little background. In March of 2008, we agreed to extend these contracts for six years each. In conjunction with these extensions, we agreed to spend significant capital upgrading both rigs. The contract contemplated an out of service period for the upgrades which at the time were estimated at 150 days. The other service period was specifically carved out of six year term extensions. So in our opinion, the contract language is clear and hopefully it’s understood at the time what was being agreed to. We don’t think we will be having this discussion if day rates are not collapsed, but rig rates have dropped and Petrobras is conveniently using this argument to try and significantly shorten the contract terms.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rajul Aggarwal</span></strong></p>
<p>So if 150 days are carved out, how is it that – disputing 500 days, or is it that deep, stay in the yard took much longer than what was contemplated in the contract.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>The latter, the time in the yard took significantly longer than we anticipated. Again, that’s what important. When this was agreed back in March of 2008, the engineering work had not been done and it was estimated 150 days at the time and it took significantly longer than that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rajul Aggarwal</span></strong></p>
<p>So I’m sorry, you said the contract contemplated 150, was there a provision in the contract that said that if the base were longer then you would get compensated for longer or how does that disagreement start?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>I think we’ve given enough of an backlog here, enough dialogue here on this topic. I’m not going to get into any more details on it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Andrew Tietz</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it’s safe to say this one thing. There was never a reference indicating that it was only 150 days in the contract.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>Correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rajul Aggarwal</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Randy Stilley</span></strong></p>
<p>Raj, anything else?</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And Raj dropped off, and we have no further questions at this time.</p>
<p><strong>Lee Ahlstrom</strong></p>
<p>Alright. John, thank you and thanks to everyone for joining us today. We appreciate that. We will be back in November to report our third quarter earnings. And of course Steve and I are here in the office today to follow-up on any questions you might have. Thanks again for joining us. Bye-bye.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today’s conference. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.</p>
