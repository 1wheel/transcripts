Later, we will conduct a question-and-answer session. Please note that the conference is being recorded.</p>
<p>Now I will turn the call over to Mr. Matthew Kolby.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Kolby</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, John. Welcome everyone to Markit’s earnings conference call to discuss our results for the second quarter of 2015. With me today in New York is Lance Uggla, Founder and Chief Executive Officer, and joining me from London is Paul Harris, our Group Finance Director.</p>
<p>To set the agenda for the call, Lance will begin by walking through some of the key highlights during the quarter and then Paul will cover our financial performance in greater detail before we open up the call for Q&amp;A. As a reminder, the call is being webcast and a replay will be available later today on the IR section of the Markit Web site. The press release and supporting documents can also be found on our Web site.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I would like to remind everyone that this call may include certain forward-looking statements based on our current expectation. Actual results could differ materially from those implied or expressed via our comments today. Information about the factors that can affect future performance or events is summarized at the end of our press release as well as contained in our recent SEC filings, including our Annual Report on Form 20-F.</p>
<p>And I will now turn it over to Lance.</p>
<p><strong>Lance Uggla</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks, Matt and good morning everybody and thank you for joining us today. It's been a year ago since we IPOd Markit and at that time we laid our long-term financial goals of 5% to 7% organic growth. Double-digit growth including acquisitions and margins in the low to mid-40s. And a year later, we remain committed to delivering on each and every one of those.</p>
<p>So today I want to talk to you about three things. First, I want to talk to you about our operating performance in the quarter including an update on our strategy within the processing division. Secondly, I want to talk to you about the acquisitions we have recently announced and how they are going to help drive long-term organic growth. And finally, I would like to talk to you about share buyback and the impact that will have on earnings per share growth in 2015.</p>
<p>So let's start off with the quarter. So in Q2 organic revenue growth was 5.1% putting us about 5.6% organic growth year-to-date. Adjusted EBITDA margin remains strong at 44.6% and the pace of our acquisitions has picked up. So let's talk about the performance of each of the three divisions including some key business wins.</p>
<p>I am going to start off with the information division. This division had solid organic growth of 4.9% and here we signed significant long-term sponsorship agreements for our Asia, Middle East and South African PMI with Nikkei in Asia and for all of the non-China, so Japan and non-China, Caixin in China and Emirates in the Middle East and Standard Bank in South Africa. Each of these are great partners with strong brands and are committed to long-term contracts.</p>
<p>In the solutions division, we continue to deliver strong organic growth of 13.2% and we had a great cross sell in the quarter of our WSO loan servicing product to a Danish bank as we continue to buildout agency loan services to banks in Europe. I will have to say the real highlight of this quarter was processing. Here revenues were down only 2.5% year on year despite the overall impact of electronic trading and clearing which includes the price changes that we put in place in April.</p>
<p>By the end of the year, we expect to have realized approximately $20 million of the $50 million-$60 million revenue reduction we have been expecting, leaving us with approximately $35 million to phase-in over 2016 and '17. So by year-end we will take in a substantial part of that processing change already. Jeff and Paul will talk about this in more detail but on the expense side in the processing division, we continue to manage costs, mitigating the impact of further revenue reduction in helping us maintain adjusted EBITDA margins of approximately 50% going forward.</p>
<p>And we are excited about the growth potential of new products in this division as well. Like in the FX part of the processing division, where we have just launched two new products that aim to help the FX industry operate more efficiently, an options confirmation and exercise service and a broker affirmation platform. We have seen good initial pick up here in the cross sell side and buy side and we expect to see continued ramp-up in their use.</p>
<p>Across the board, the processing division led by Brad Levy and his team are doing a great job at managing the business and driving towards sustainable, long-term performance.</p>
<p>So, overall, I am very pleased with how we are performing in software division and the team's ability to execute on our priorities to deliver our growth. Let me talk about acquisitions, moving on to Slide 6.</p>
<p>So we have a proven track record over the past 12 years of leveraging our strong cash flow and balance sheet to acquire and integrate companies that will accelerate long-term organic revenue growth. And this Slide really shows the strategy at work as we indentify strong bolt-on acquisitions that are complementary to our existing businesses and fuel innovation and product development, providing enhanced value to our customers.</p>
<p>A great example within our loans business. Over the past ten year within the loans space, we have combined $100 million of revenues from four different acquisitions to become a market leader in loans with over $215 million of loan revenues today. Another great example is within the derivate space. While we entered price testing of derivative model with an acquisition that had revenues of $15 million to $20 million. Today our derivative price testing coupled with our organically grown independent valuation services, amount to more than $120 million of revenue. That’s what we do. We identify an opportunity and execute a strategy that couples organically developed product with bolt-on acquisition to build a leading position in the marketplace.</p>
<p>Now this is exactly what we are doing with the acquisition of Information Mosaic on Page 7. Two years ago we acquired a managed service to cleanse and process corporate actions. And in July this year, we completed the acquisition of Information Mosaic that provides leading software with securities processing including the ability to manage the full corporate actions lifecycle. The integration has gone well as it expands our offering and positions Markit as a leading provider or end to end securities processing and corporate actions., capitalizing on the emerging trends for institutions to manage cost better by implementing an enterprise model for these processes.</p>
<p>And it's more of the same today with the acquisition and announcement of CoreOne Technologies. This is a firm with four exciting business. Each of these will help accelerate organic growth as well as new product development across markets. We will combine their trade execution quality and regulatory reporting solution, RegOne with our TCA platform. We will extend our capabilities in the prime brokerage services through PrimeOne. We will take their index business, their index data management platform and combine it with ours and along the way we will generate some significant cost savings.</p>
<p>And finally, the VistaOne reporting platform will tie in nicely with the broad set of reporting services that Markit offers as part of our enterprise data management solution. This is a classic Markit acquisition where we are combining high quality businesses to form a fully integrated solution for our customer. Each of these companies deliver solutions consistent with our strategy of helping our customers reduce cost and manage regulatory change, broadening the range of services we can offer, in turn helping drive long-term organic growth across Markit Group.</p>
<p>Our acquisition pipeline remains as active as ever and we are currently working on a number of other opportunities that very much fit that bolt-on strategy. Finally, let me talk to you about the share buybacks on Slide 8. So in Q2, we successfully completed our secondary offering together with $350 million share buyback. The secondary offering reduced the ownership of our original bank shareholders to below 15% while simultaneously increasing our free float. This should help improve liquidity in our stock and remove a significant portion of the perceived overhand from pre-IPO investors. We will look to execute a second share purchase of $150 million before the year-end which will complete our current $500 million share buyback program.</p>
<p>As a result of these buybacks, we expect our share count going into 2016 to have been reduced by approximately 18 million shares and together with the recent acquisition, will have a positive impact on adjusted EPS in 2016 of approximately 10%. Going forward with our current level of leverage, we maintain the balance sheet flexibility needed to invest in product development, acquire companies to accelerate long term organic growth or execute further share buybacks, all in order to continue to drive long-term shareholder value.</p>
<p>We have had a solid first half of our year and delivered consistently on our strategy. Our customers continue to face the challenges of managing regulatory change and reducing cost, and as both the sell side and buy side focus on managing these aspects of their businesses, we will remain very well positioned to help them deliver on their goals.</p>
<p>I am going to now hand it over to Paul Harris, our Group Financial Director, to take you through the financial performance in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Paul Harris</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Lance, and good morning everyone. This is a very solid quarter for Markit going into the second half of the year and I would start by walking you through the summary of Q2 financials on Slide 10.</p>
<p>Revenues in constant currency grew 6.7% or 3.2% on a reported basis, including the negative impact of FX in the quarter. Adjusted EBITDA was $120.9 million, we maintained the margins at 44.6% in line with Q1. This is a good performance in the context of the $5 million revenue reduction due to the impact of the impact of electronic trading and clearing in our processing division in Q2, which I will discuss later.</p>
<p>Adjusted earnings were next year $68.4 million with Q2 diluted adjusted earnings per share of $.36, 2.7% lower than the prior year. Diluted share count increased 4.4% due to both a higher average share price used to calculate option dilution and option exercised into shares since Q2 2014. We repurchased 14 million shares on June 10 which had a marginal impact this quarter on our share count but which would further mitigate the impact on diluted EPS from next quarter. I will discuss share count in more detail later in my remarks.</p>
<p>Turning to Slide 11. Our organic revenue growth in Q2 was 5.1% which brings us to 5.6% for the half year. Both information and solutions continue to perform well while processing showed slight organic revenue decline. This resulted from the anticipated impact of the electronic trading and clearing on revenue following the changes we implemented at the beginning of April. There was acquisition related revenue growth of 1.6% for the quarter, driven by thinkFolio and Tax Solutions, both of which were acquired in 2014. As a reminder, Information Mosaic was closed in July so did not feature in our Q2 results.</p>
<p>FX movements adversely affected the quarter reducing revenue growth by 3.5% primarily due to the strength in U.S. dollar against both sterling and euro. As you can see on Slide 12, we continue to grow the fixed recurring proportion of our revenue base which in Q2 stood at just over 55% of group revenues. Variable recurring revenues fell to just under 40%, primarily due to lower revenue processing year-over-year. We continue to have approximately 95% of revenues from recurring contracts. Additionally, renewal rates on fixed recurring contracts were over 90% for the quarter, one of our strongest recent results.</p>
<p>Now let's look at our operating expenses on Slide 13. Q2 operating expenses increased by $3.9 million or 2.7% compared to the prior year. This increase supports growth including acquisitions and was partially mitigated by FX movements. Let's move on to talk about the performance of our operating segments in more detail, starting on Slide 14.</p>
<p>Organic growth in the information division was 14.9% for the quarter, driven by solid growth across CDS and loans pricing, reference data product and continued strong performance in indices. Indices saw double-digit growth on a constant currency basis due to a continued increase in ETF assets under management tide to our iBoxx indices, as well as new customer wins. We also saw growth in our custom indices business as we signed a significant outsourcing deal with a large global bank that was looking to comply with the new index regulations.</p>
<p>As Lance mentioned, following a productive five-year sponsorship relationship with HSBC on our Asian PMIs, we have now signed significant multiyear partnerships with new sponsors which reflect the value of these highly watched indicators. We believe these strong local partnerships would be an important part of expanding our profile and presence in these regions.</p>
<p>Now turning to processing on Slide 15. Reported revenue in processing was down 6.4% compared to the prior year. However, organic revenue only decreased 2.5% year-over-year excluding adverse foreign exchange rate movements. We saw a very strong underlying volume performance in the division but this was offset by the impact of the electronic trading and clearing. This impact has been anticipated for a number of quarters. Rates volumes were robust and offset the continued weaker performance in the credits derivative market.</p>
<p>Following weak primary loan volumes in Q1 this year, we saw a strong rebound in market and we had a very robust quarter although still slightly below the strong Q2 performance last year. During the second quarter, we estimate that the impact of electronic trading and clearing on processing revenue was approximately $5 million, largely as a result of the pricing changes we implemented at the beginning of April.</p>
<p>Of our originally identified $50 million-$60 million of potential annual revenue impact, we therefore anticipate approximately $35 million is still to be realized in future quarters. Whilst we cannot control the timing of the market transition, we would anticipate only more modest additional movements during the remainder of 2015 and through most of 2016 with further large-scale movements awaiting European adoption in 2017. There is also have been a focus on realizing operational efficiencies and reducing technology spend in the division. And you can see the impact of this in our ability to maintain 54% margin this quarter. The processing team have done a lot of work, firming up additional plans to make our cost base more efficient. And at this point, we anticipate being able to hold adjusted EBITDA margin close to 50% through the transition to electronic trading.</p>
<p>Whilst a decline from today's levels, this is an improvement on margin levels we have previously discussed. Looking ahead to Q3, I want to remind everyone that in the third quarter, we typically see a seasonal slowdown in market activity and additionally last year we has some one off revenue associated with regulatory reporting which won't be repeated this year.</p>
<p>Now turning to our solutions segment on Slide 16. Q2 reported revenue increased by 17.1% or 13.2% on an organic basis driven by growth across both sub-divisions. We continue to see solid growth across our largest product including On Demand and EDM. In On Demand, our web design, building and hosting business, growth was driven by new customer wins including cross selling and further product development. We also showed good progress in building out services for the wealth management space. EDM, our leading software platform for the management of pricing and reference data, also continued to show strong double-digit growth but at a slower rate than previous quarters as the product matures.</p>
<p>In WSO, our loan portfolio management solution, we saw growth in both software and services driven by the increased attractiveness of the loan asset class. Loan AUMs grew more slowly than in recent quarters following on from the weaker Q1 market, but we would expect this trend to reserve now that the primary market has improved. Newer businesses are also performing well. Corporate actions grew in double-digits as customers, new customers signed up and we expect the acquisition of Information Mosaic to complement and further enhance our opportunity to grow this product.</p>
<p>Our KYC initiative and partnership with Genpact continue to win new customers and ramp up its operations during the quarter. The thinkFolio and Tax Solutions acquisition which we acquired in 2014, contributed 6.1% to second quarter revenue growth. Information Mosaic, as mentioned earlier, will be included in solutions acquired growth starting in Q3. Adjusted EBITDA increased 14.7% to $25.8 million and margin this quarter will be maintained at 31.3% compared to Q2 last year. We anticipate continuing to run divisional margins at this level as we invest in the product.</p>
<p>Now looking at Slide 17, operating cash flows for the first half of 2015 were $197.9 million, a 54% increase compared to last year. Improved collections of receivables contributed to $58 million over the period. Discipline over our capital expenditure meant that at $63.6 million in the first half of 2015, we were broadly flat last year. As a percentage of revenue, CapEx therefore declined from 12.2% to 11.7%. Additionally, option exercises by employees have generated nearly $132 million year-to-date. Cash outflow associated with share buybacks of $394.1 million reflects $351.2 million associated with the recent share buyback in June and $42.9 million related to the 2012 buyback.</p>
<p>The net impact of all of this was to increase net debt by $104.7 million as compared to 31 December, 2012. And as a result, our leverage ratio increased to 0.86 times adjusted EBITDA. Given our current leverage, we will look to utilize the remaining $150 million of our share repurchase program by year-end in the open market. This of course is subject to conditions over time. When combined, with the acquisition of Information Mosaic and CoreOne, we anticipate this would increase our leverage to approximately 1.5 times. This is more in line with our view of an optimal leverage level whilst leaving considerable capacity for additional capital deployment as needed.</p>
<p>As we have mentioned before, we have been actively looking to term out part of our debt and given our now expected higher leverage level, we expect to finalize arrangements in Q4 to fix $500 million of additional capacity with a mix of seven and 10 year terms. This will protect earnings from future interest rate rises and give market the capacity and flexibility we require for the future when combined with our existing $1.05 billion revolving credit facility. The RCF would initially be paid down by the fixed debt. And as Lance mentioned, we expect that the share repurchase, the Information Mosaic and CoreOne acquisition, and this set term out will overall have a positive impact on 2016 EPS of approximately 10%.</p>
<p>Also to remind everyone, that we expect CoreOne will be accretive to our adjusted earnings immediately upon completion and that return on invested capital will exceed our WAC in 2017. As promised earlier, let me talk about share count on Slide 18. To illustrate how we are actively taking steps to mitigate share dilution. On June 10, we bought back approximately 14 million shares as part of our secondary offering, utilizing $350 million of our $500 million share buyback authorization.</p>
<p>Given the timing, this buyback reduced our Q2 weighted average share count by approximately 3 million shares to 191 million shares outstanding. So we would expect a further 11 million reduction in share count for Q3 since it would be effective for the full quarter. The chart is a bridge of our expected share count for the remainder of the year, assuming continued dilution from option exercises and executing remaining 115 million share repurchase in fourth quarter.</p>
<p>For clarity, it assumes a constant share price and that option exercises by employees in second half of the year follows broadly similar pattern since first half. As we mentioned on the call in Q1, in the future we expect to continue to offset the dilutive impact of annual compensation awards and ongoing option exercises. As a result, we estimate or weighted average shares outstanding for year 2016 to be approximately 182 million shares.</p>
<p>In all, this is a very solid quarter for Markit heading into the second half of the year. Importantly, our M&amp;A pipeline is more active and we are taking steps to deploy our capital to support EPS growth in 2016. I would now like to hand the call back over to Matt.</p>
<p><strong>Matthew Kolby</strong></p>
<p>That concludes our prepared remarks. Operator, we would now like to open up the call for questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question is from Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Toni Kaplan</span></strong></p>
<p>Could you give some additional financial detail around the CoreOne acquisition if you have revenue and EBITDA? Also you mentioned some cost savings that you're expecting, if you could quantify that as well? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>First off, we are not sharing the revenues and EBITDA but what I can say is that we have a complementary index management business that will produce strong cost savings of four or so over the coming months and quarters. We also have said that the acquisition will be accretive immediately so, hopefully that demonstrates that we have executed with good shareholder value in mind. And we see the, our own WAC being exceeded in 2017. So all in all we think it's a great acquisition, it's got a combination of strong revenue synergies with good cost savings in one of the business units. So we see it performing very well as its integrated into Markit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Toni Kaplan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Terrific. And just another one on just acquisition strategy. Just wanted to know, I know you're basically at your target level of leverage after buybacks and these acquisitions. So just wanted to understand, does it limit your desire to do a large acquisition near term? Or there have been some media reports that you are looking at some very large assets. So I just wanted to know if it limits future M&amp;A as well as your stance on equity issuance? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, we are committed to bolt-on strategy. That strategy is one that we know very well. We have done well by it. I gave a couple of examples of today in my remarks in terms of the loan space or building out the derivative space, which combined our substantive demonstrations of a combination of bolt on acquisitions with organic growth on the back of that. And so we are definitely committed to that. In terms of rumors, I think what's important for our shareholders is that they know that we are always going to analyze the assets in our space. So if these assets in our space, a lot of time rumors will swirl that we are an interested party. But what I can tell you is that we will always analyze assets that we think are relevant to our company.</p>
<p>We are going to definitely, as I said, continue to focus on our bolt on acquisition strategy and remain really disciplined. So I can only ever see it deviating from that strategy if I was convinced that it would generate significant shareholder value.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Ato Garrett from Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ato Garrett</span></strong></p>
<p>I just had a question relating to the acquisitions you've announced. I know that's a core base of your strategy. I'm just curious to see if that's really changed or if that's driving increased exposure to the buy-side or how that's been tracking?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I think the drivers that surround Markit are need to manage cost and the implementation of regulatory change. Those two things are impacting the buy side as much as they are impacting the sell side. So we definitely see increasing addressable market for our products in across the buy side globally. So definitely not a change in terms of our strategy but we see the addressable market in the buy side as something that will continue to increase.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ato Garrett</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And you gave us a little bit of details on volume trends for the various asset classes traded within the processing division. Could you talk about what you could see or how that might change expectations for that division if we saw a rate hike from the Fed?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, what's interesting in the rates part of our processing division is volatility is generally a positive for the division and we earn on a per trade basis. So more volatile markets with things going on generally means there is more trading. And if volumes increase that’s good for us. And in the caution that we have provided from the beginning of going public, we have never really made any assumptions about volume increases, rather what we have done is just talk to you about the price side and so I think there is a potentially good upside for us if rates were to rise.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ato Garrett</span></strong></p>
<p>And lastly, can you give us some more details about the sponsorships you announced within the index division?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Quite a few years back, we acquired into our index franchise the economic index platform that does the PMIs globally. So a lot of people, when they hear the HSBC China PMI which is now the Caixin China PMI, they don’t realize that that underlying IP is actually owned, operated and managed by Markit. And we cover some 90%, or close to 90% of the world's GDP is covered by our indices. One of the things that we have been doing increasingly is actually to look -- because we don’t necessarily have a retail brand that will benefit in a region from having our name on it. I know it gives us some brand value just as Markit. But the brand value that a media company gets or a financial institution in a region gets from having their name on that, is very valuable, because the number of press hits that those indices get in the news journals, blogs, newspapers around the world, is substantive and it really has opened up a new revenue source for us.</p>
<p>And the team under Luke Thompson, who runs our economic business, has just done a great job with identifying long term sponsorships and branding of those indices and we look to continue to do that. And they are definitely unlocking some incremental value.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Andre Benjamin from Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andre Benjamin</span></strong></p>
<p>In the processing business, you said that the revenue impact of the pricing concessions has been about $5 million which is in line with your prior expectations. So is it fair to say you're not seeing any volume uplift? I know that was not part of your base case. And if not, as you talk to some of your customers, is there any indication that that might be something that will come down the line due to the concession?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. We actually did strong volumes in rates this quarter and loans were strong performer as well. But going forward, as electronic -- so we started out with this, framing this $50 million-$60 million impact and year-to-date or by the end of this year we expect about $20 million of that will be achieved. And that's what we said. There is probably $30 million-$35 million of that left over the next two years. And we said two years because in the second -- by the end of the second year we will have the European regulations rolled out. And so that frames what we describe as the complete revenue side of the story with respect to price changes. Because it's not that we see business going away, we just see business at a lower price point because electronic trading has less work to do than the old OTC trades.</p>
<p>We haven't considered any volume increases in any of that analysis. And we are optimistic that if things really did go electronically, people aren't going to be trading $100 million rates trade on a point and click on a screen. And it might be 10 trades or five trades or seven trades. We are not aware of what that impact will be, we can only analyze the effects in equities and other markets where there has been substantive volume increases. But we see that and we have taken a very conservative approach is any public company to just put the lowest baseline that we see and then be surprised on the upside. And so I look forward to being able to start to introduce volumes into these quarterly announcements, if and when they pickup. But to date, I see it as business as usual. We are introducing the price cuts, the impacts are --- to me the future impact is now marginal for the company. And given that Brad and his team have now introduced some substantive cost programs and we can maintain 50% plus margins, I think we are in a very good place and going forward I hope we can please you on the upside.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andre Benjamin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. And then on the M&amp;A side, I was wondering with the volatility we've seen in the public markets, any insight into valuation on potential targets and the private market that you're looking at. How that makes you feel about your ability to close these deals going forward in the next couple years and are you seeing any change in the willingness to sell with the recent pullback?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>It's interesting because you definitely saw it sit on the sidelines throughout most of last year. And so we can say we are busy with the IPO and therefore we didn't get a lot done. But we looked at a lot of acquisitions every year and we continue to do so. But the pipeline of acquisitions for us is very strong and for it to be -- for me to say it's very strong, it's got to represent value. And we are always very disciplined and I think we have, both with Information Mosaic and CoreOne as well as the Halifax Index, a deal we announced earlier this year. These are all very earnings accretive and meet and exceed our WAC in what I would consider very reasonable time frames. So therefore they do represent value. We are not identifying multiples, either revenue multiples or EBITDA multiples where we are acquiring things. But at the same time these acquisitions, both represent good shareholder value and we are excited about how they can fuel additional organic growth.</p>
<p>And any other assets that we are looking at, we will have to meet that disciplined criteria. But I don't know why those two particular acquisitions have met our criteria and I look in the public markets at things that are being announced or other private assets that we have seen trade at what I would consider some ridiculous prices. You would think everything is really expensive but we are satisfied with the acquisitions that we have made that they do represent a good strong shareholder value for our company.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Manav Patnaik from Barclays.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Manav Patnaik</span></strong></p>
<p>Glad to hear some potential upside coming from the processing side. The one thing I want to just get reminded of or refreshed was, I think from the move to the electronic exchanges there was some anticipated impact on some of the pricing and reference data on the information division side as well. I was just wondering if you could give us an update on what trends you're seeing there and how things are tracking with respect to that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>No, we didn't -- I don't think I have ever said there is any impact on electronic trading to the pricing in reference to division -- pricing and reference data. There would be no significant change or any change that is relevant on that side. So maybe I am misunderstanding your question, Manav, or I have confused...</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Manav Patnaik</span></strong></p>
<p>I think initially there was the expectation that with these things getting electronic, some of that data I guess that you were collecting manually which was on the information side, could see some impact that you guys you were prepared in advance...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Manav Patnaik</span></strong></p>
<p>As that...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So what I was referring to is on the credit derivative side, what some folks said, if credit derivates were to end up on an exchange as futures contract, would that impact your, the information division and the credit pricing part of the division. We actually see that as a positive impact because the main data set that we would see with potential to become a futures contract, is actually the CDX iTraxx, the index contracts. And we have index contracts now designed and available with ICE. Those particular contracts haven't generated any interest but if they did, the licensing revenue for those indices would be very attractive to market. And the index data that we sell today, we actually sell for zero because we give it away for free on our Web site. So we don’t charge for index data. What people buy from us are the underlying prices to the index as well as several thousand other credit prices.</p>
<p>And it really is about buying that complete daily and historical package of data. And we don’t see that going away and we don’t see the entire credit market moving from OTC to futures contracts. We just don’t think there is interest or necessary liquidity to drive those types of contract. So I think you can [indiscernible] positive. Yes, go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Manav Patnaik</span></strong></p>
<p>No. Okay, that's fine. That's helpful. Just on the solutions division, 13% obviously is a very healthy number. But I think from initial expectations it was closer to the high teens, was what the initial expectation was. So just curious if there was anything -- is it timing related based on the contracts rolling, just some thoughts around the growth rates there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>I guess probably two or three comments there. But one, solutions division has potential to be a little bit lumpy on the software side, so that would be one reason. The managed services actually were operating in the high-teens in terms of performance. So very happy. Enterprise software, a little bit slower but no performance concerns. So I really think that when you look at this division, teams performance to me on any quarter is acceptable. I am not managing the division quarter-to-quarter and trying to quarterly numbers, but nothing has changed in my view. I see this as a strong division now and in the coming years and with continued guidance of double-digit growth.</p>

<p>Our next question is from Andrew Steinerman from JPMorgan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p>
<p>I have two questions. I wanted to ask about the margins trajectory for the information division. This division showed huge margin expansion year-over-year in the first quarter and the second quarter was up only 10 basis points. Help us understand the difference between the first quarter and the second quarter performance and what will be the near term margin trajectory for the information division. Is it expansionary like in the first quarter or is it more slightly up in the second quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Paul, do you want to grab that one.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Harris</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, thanks Lance. In terms of the trajectory, Andrew, we continue to think that information margins will grow as we go through into Q3 and Q4. If we look at Q2, we had a little bit of pricing pressure with regard to -- or revenue pressure with regard to Totem, that come through in terms of margin. We have now finished all of that Totem term outs now. And really that was the key driver. We do think we will continue to grow margins through into Q3 and Q4. Not necessarily at the same rate as we managed last year but clearly we are keeping in line on our cost and managed our cost base to ensure accretion as we go through Q3 and Q4. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That makes sense. In the processing division, I want to understand what syndicated loan volumes affect your business. Is it the primary or is it the secondary syndicated loan markets that affect the volume piece of processing and was that favorable or unfavorable in the second quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>So, both. So primary issuance, we saw very strong primary issuance, but we also maintained high levels of secondary trading volumes as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p>
<p>Lance, I didn't understand the answer to your question. Does both primary and secondary affect processing revenues for Markit?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It does. Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andrew Steinerman</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, and when you say, just say it again. Overall, syndicated loan volumes were strong in the second quarter when you take primary and secondary together, or is it a mix for the two? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, it's a mix every quarter. So year-over-year we saw strong performance considering Q2 last year was very strong in primary. And incrementally to that we maintained high levels of secondary trading volume as well.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Alex Kramm from UBS.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Kramm</span></strong></p>
<p>So just wanted to come back to the accretion or the financial impact of these deals. Appreciate you don't want to give revenue or EBITDA, I guess we'll have to wait for that. But when I look at the management action slide, the term 10% you're doing. If I look at the share count component, I think it's probably something like 4% to 5% accretive, the share buyback, if I'm doing my math right here. Does the remainder, that other call it 5% in round numbers, is that just accretion from M&amp;A or is there anything else in there that you would point out in that 10% accretion?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, Paul, do you want to answer that one?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Paul Harris</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. I think you got it right in terms of aspect around share buyback, around 5% associated with the $350 million, coming in terms of full year effect through 2016. Clearly, there is also a slight increment associated with the further $150 million share buyback that we spoke about earlier on the call that will have a bigger effect in 2016 then it will in 2015. So I think at 5% it's a little bit off with regard to just the incremental impact to share buyback. Clearly we have the acquisitions and they are also -- but we than have the negative impacts associated with the term out of that debt and the interest charge that we will be paying versus the RCF having a negative affect also. So the combination of the two share buybacks streams, the acquisition and the negative impact of that debt term out drive that 10%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Kramm</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That's helpful. Thank you. And then, just coming back to your comments on some of these new initiatives driving growth for the company already. This might be a little bit in the weeds, but when I look at that revenue that's associated with your minority interest businesses I guess, that's been flattish, $2 million for last three quarters. Actually was down a little bit this quarter, if my math is right. So just kind of square this a little bit. Are we not really seeing revenue from some of these KYC deals yet and that's still coming? Maybe you can give us an update on the magnitude. Or is that not the right way to look at it, I guess, the revenue contribution here, that $2 million per quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>No. I think it's fair to say to look at the -- you are talking about the Genpact JV in terms of -- are you not, is that what you are referring to...?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Kramm</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I mean unless there's something else in that $2 million minority interest related revenue that you've got all going on that I don't know, but I guess it's KYC Genpact, right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>I am going to let Paul confirm that in a moment but let me just talk about KYC first and then I will toss it to him just to make sure we give you a proper answer. So on KYC, I would love to start identifying revenue on a quarterly basis with any of the new managed services that we launch because these are really strong organic growth expectations for our future in the solutions division. And given where the margins are in that division, you can see that we continue to invest heavily in new initiatives. So KYC, the best measurement on KYC is the number of active participating banks. And I think historically I have talked about initially the four or five bank partners but subsequently now we have signed additional banks.</p>
<p>And what I can say that nine of the largest global banks are actively implementing the service. And I am pleased with our performance and I do believe that we still have the edge over competitors in this space. We also are focusing in regions around the world, France, Australia and Canada. And we are seeing some real positive results starting to show there. So I think that’s really important. The second thing that I see as an edge for us, and again it fits well the whole concept of how we do bolt on acquisitions. We acquired CTI, which is a -- it's the tax solutions for financial market participants, FATCA. But then subsequently the world has went to these common reporting standards with some 90 countries now have signed up to CRS, which is really a FATCA like requirement to track individuals as they invest around the world.</p>
<p>Now, we are very well positioned. Given we are a market leader with respect to our tax solutions, this segue is very well on to our KYC platform coupled with our CTI acquisition. So I am very bullish about KYC as the managed service. I know, I would love to be on each quarter already providing you some revenue updates or guidance, but I don’t have that today. What I can say is our investments are strong in the division and we are continuing to see encouraging results and I am bullish on my outlook for those initiatives.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Sara Gubins from Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sara Gubins</span></strong></p>
<p>I know you don't provide guidance, but I'm wondering if you could talk through some of your high level expectations for the three segments in the back half of the year and if there's anything in particular that we should look out for? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>I would definitely say that we are going to maintain our momentum in the second half, I feel positive. I think what also is interesting is the drivers that drive market, are all solidly in place. So regulatory change in implementation, it just isn't waning at all. If anything, it's accelerating. So that’s a super driver for market. The second driver that’s good for market is the fact that everybody is focused on improving ROE from post Dodd-Frank costs of implementation and market structure changes. And that’s a great driver. Third, emerging markets. You know Kevin taking the helm as my partner in Asia, we really have a solid footprint on the ground and emerging market growth is starting to accelerate for us. And I see those drivers as being firmly in place.</p>
<p>You then move to -- on the final two drivers, technology change and passive investment styles and shift towards ETFs and a more passive approach to fixed management. I see us very well positioned in that index space. And because we are a young, fresh company, we are only 12 years old, we are burdened with heavy legacy, old systems and technology. And therefore we can use technology change as a disrupter or ability for us to move more quickly. And so I am very optimistic. I think second half continued, but even as I look forward into '16, '17, I don’t see any changes to that.</p>
<p>I talked a bit today about our bolt on acquisition strategy and identified how we enter into a market. So I don’t know how clear I was from the script on derivatives but maybe I will give you a little bit of more color. So when we acquired that first $20 million-$30 million of revenue from Totem back in, whatever it was, 2004-5, probably 2005. We did that because we saw the opportunity to be a world leader in terms of derivative pricing valuations, price testing of models. And that led us into the processing and an acquisition called Communicator which spawned MarkitSERV. And when you looked at that slide today on page 6, acquisitions are things above the -- at the top of the page. But at the bottom it's all the organic growth that couples together with that. And with both CoreOne and Information Mosaic, we are doing those same things again.</p>
<p>And I am bullish on the acquisition and the consolidation of our space going forward and I think in the second half, you will see us continue on that bolt on strategy that I feel will drive long term growths. So Q3, rest of the year, I am positive. We also see good value in our share buyback. We said we are going to do $500 million, I expect to complete that before the end of the year. And that’s going to leave us in a very strong position going into 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sara Gubins</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thanks. Maybe I'll just sneak in one quick one. When do you expect Europe to make changes around electronic trading? Do you plan to proactively make changes around pricing in Europe, similar to what you've done in the U.S.? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So 2017 is the schedule. We have framed that's $50 million to $60 million. That’s the total. So over the next couple of years, that's remaining say $30 million-$35 million, I would like to see come out of our numbers. So that’s all behind us. Two things can be positive on the back of that. One, we get expenses under control. I have committed today with a little bit of guidance that we will operated that division at a 50% margin. I am seeing the impact of both the price changes on the revenue side but also what the [indiscernible] is doing on the cost side. So I think that’s a real positive. And we don’t know about volumes. And if electronic trading really takes hold, then we expect volume uplift which would be an incremental upside to everything that we have presented. So we do think it's framed that remaining $30 million to $35 million of price cuts over two year. It's well framed, it's not material to our overall company and the cost side is under control.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is from Vincent Hung from Autonomous.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vincent Hung</span></strong></p>
<p>Just a follow-up on your progress in KYC. So I am just curious, how many legal entities do you have signed up now? What milestones do you need to still achieve there? And just on competition, is Clarient pushing you guys very hard?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. You are going to take me into the dark depth in details where I will probably go out of my depths very rapidly. But Clarient is still there as well as TR. They both have services that they are rolling out. I think of the last four or five wins in this space across the three of us, I think we have got the lion's share. So I am pleased about that. So it is competitive but I think we are showing really well in all the RFPs around this space. I think we are showing very well and the team is producing some great wins. I believe we now have 1300 entities on the platform. And then of course they have all their sub-funds etcetera. So we are rapidly rolling out milestones monthly. We did hire John May who reports to Michele Trogni, to run the KYC product for us globally. He is now well in place, doing a great job and is very operationally astute in terms of milestones and working regularly with those nine banks that are implementing the service to bring on additional entities.</p>
<p>So I think we are in great position. There is definitely room for a couple of competitors in this space but of course, no competitors is always better than one, two or three.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vincent Hung</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks. And just on another product. I guess one of the most interesting developments from my end seems to be this know your third party or know your vendor products. Can you talk a bit more about this product, what your aspirations are, and when we should expect this to take off?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So we haven't really announced anything on this but definitely it's something that’s well talked about across both the buy and sell side. Vendor compliance is a key due diligence that’s required by financial market participants. And of course, document management and compliance in regulatory change happens to be right in the sweet spot of Markit Group. And so Michele Trogni has been working with her team. Gina Ghent, one of our senior management directors is running that initiative for us. And, again, I am really excited about the size and scope of that market place, the addressable market place is substantively larger than say KYC for example, because it spans tens of thousands of vendors around the world and both financial market participants, corporates, etcetera.</p>
<p>So I look forward to telling you more about that as we progress, but to date we really haven't said a lot about the initiative. But I can tell you we are making some -- we are starting to make some investments in this space.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vincent Hung</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. And just last one from me, just another question on CoreOne. Can you just give us a bit more detail on the product mix there? Because I'm sure a lot of us really aren't too familiar with that business. What the killer product is that they have?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, it's a combination of the killer product and the killer people. And so Rob Flatley is the CEO of that business. He is a great guy. He is probably one of the key reasons I was interested in that company, is Rob and his leadership group. They are all very very good professionals in our space. But this is really a classic acquisition for Markit and I think we are able to execute this outside of a process because we really did have a great strategic fit. It's four products. So to most they look at it and go, wow, those are four products. But each and every one of those products fits into the Markit strategy very well. One of them allows a combination of our index platforms. So there we have got a better product combined. We will be competitively stronger and there is ability for us to take costs out. So we like that product. That’s the DeltaOne platform.</p>
<p>The second product that they have is a product called RegOne. So each of their products, RegOne, VistaOne, DeltaOne, and PrimeOne. Okay. So RegOne, we have a TCI, TCA product for doing transaction cost analysis. Their RegOne is very focused on best execution. Those marry together very well and Rob brings a lot of knowledge from the equity markets. He is the first executive on our team that has strength of equity markets background. If you look at my leadership, we are very operational, risk and fixed income markets backgrounds and equity is something that exists. It's strong in the firm but doesn’t sit on the executive team.</p>
<p>So Rob really will bring that to the table. So we have got TCA, the RegOne marrying very nicely and creating great cross sell opportunity with our TCA product. And we will marry those two solutions together. Then they have got the VistaOne. This is an acquisition, so CoreOne as well was acquisitive. And this was an old platform that they rebuilt. And it does reporting and documentation tools and is very much complementary to or EDM platform. So that will get integrated into our EDM business. It will be led by our head, Spiros, who heads up our EDM business, will take on the leadership of VistaOne as well and we look to integrate those two platforms together.</p>
<p>So again, bolt on, driving organic growth in both the acquired target as well as ours and the new product development adjacent to that. And then finally, the new business for us is the DeltaOne business. Sorry, it's the PrimeOne solutions business. And that's hosted global prime brokerage service. So when Barclays and Lehman were put together some years back or when Barclays bought Lehman, they ended up with two prime brokerage platforms. CoreOne actually lifted out the Barclays platform or acquire the Barclays platform and then created a managed service to allow tier 2 banks to be able to enter into the financing the space by leveraging a full technology platform. And they have had great wins and these are real managed services where we will be managing the technology platform but of course every technology platform need content and it needs to be hosted an managed and that creates great synergies with our securities finance product and other equity services that we offer.</p>
<p>So I am excited. It's a classic market acquisition. It's got three or four products that bolt in very well and we will be able to accelerate the growth of those products, we will be able to take out some cost and then we will grow new products on an adjacent side to that. And then on top of that, we get some great new people into our firm. So that took us a long time. This is the second time I have tried to buy CoreOne. And so we finally got Rob and his team to the table. So that was long description of it. But I think hopefully helpful to see how we see the accretive nature of that acquisition.</p>

<p>Our next question is from Gary Bisbee from RBC Capital Markets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Bisbee</span></strong></p>
<p>I realize it's late. Just one quick one from me. Do you have a sense at this point yet, or can you help us think what we should think about in terms of likely interest rate on the longer term loans you're looking to refinance into later this year? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>My view would be at seven and ten years you have got be at or less than 4%.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our last question would be from Phil Stiller from Citi.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Phil Stiller</span></strong></p>
<p>Just had one follow-up question. At the beginning, Lance, you talked about margins for the overall business still being in the low 40s. Would the higher targets now for processing, wondering why you might not raise that target a bit. You've been in the mid 40s here for a bit and it seems like the margins in processing will not be impacted as much as you previously thought. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. While we say low to mid 40s, doesn’t that cover me up to 47.5%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Phil Stiller</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes, I thought the implication was low 40s, but...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lance Uggla</span></strong></p>
<p>No, no. I always say low to mid-40s and I guess I haven't dropped the word low yet. Maybe that’s the conservative nature of Jeff and Paul but I do say low to mid-40s and I think that covers me from kind of 40 to 47. So maybe we will tighten up that guidance going forward but at the moment we will stick with low to mid-40s. And in case any of you are wondering, Jeff is here with me but he caught the flu the last couple of days so he was quite ill. But Paul Harris has been running financial for Markit for a long time and it was great to have him on the call today and that too covered the financial section. So we threw him in at last minute last night and he did a great job. So it's good for you guys to get to know Paul as well.\</p>
<p>I think that’s it. So thank you everybody for joining us. I remain excited and optimistic about the rest of the year and 2016 forward. I think we are framing up any of the challenges that people have seen around the company in terms of processing. I think framed those up for you very well. We have got our acquisition track on fire. We see some good value in the acquisitions we are making and so I remain very positive with our forward projections of the numbers that we continue to reiterate to you. So thank you very much.</p>
