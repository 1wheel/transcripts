  <p>Singapore Telecommunications Ltd. (<a href='http://seekingalpha.com/symbol/sgtcf' title='Singapore Telecommunications Ltd.'>OTC:SGTCF</a>) Q1 2016 Earnings Conference Call August 12, 2015 11:00 PM ET</p><p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Welcome to the Singtel FY16 Q1 results conference call. (Operator Instructions).</p>
<p>Ms. Sin, over to you.</p>
<p><strong>Sin Yang Fong</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, operator. A warm welcome to all investors and analysts. You are listening in to Singtel's earnings conference call for the first quarter end of June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>My name is Sin Yang Fong, and let me introduce management on the call. Ms. Chua Sock Koong, Group CEO; Mr. Allen Lew, CEO of Consumer Australia; Mr. Yuen Kuan Moon, CEO of Consumer Singapore; Mr. Bill Chang, CEO of Group Enterprise; Mr. Samba Natarajan, CEO of Group Digital Life; Mr. Mark Chong, CEO of International; Ms. Lim Cheng Cheng, Group CFO. They are also assisted by other members of the management team from Singapore and Australia.</p>
<p>Before we start taking questions, I would like to invite Sock Koong to share some highlights from this set of results.</p>
<p><strong>Chua Sock Koong</strong></p>
<p>Yang Fong, thank you very much, and thank you everyone for joining us for Singtel's results for the fourth quarter ended June 30, 2015.</p>
<p>The Group delivered a strong performance in the first quarter and net profits were up 13%, and that's despite significant currency weakness in the Australian dollar and the Indonesian rupiah. Just for your information, during the quarter, the A dollar depreciation by 11% year on year and the Indonesian rupiah was down 6% year on year.</p>
<p>So the results reflect the strength and the resilience of the Group's core business, and that's as a result of all measures that we have taken to invest in network, distribution and improving customer experience. Through these initiatives we've been able to capture the right demand for mobile data and digital services across the markets that we operate in.</p>
<p>Optus gained further momentum in the quarter and we saw increase in ARPU in both the postpaid and prepaid segments. The regional mobile associates saw strong customer growth and increased data usage. We continue to expand our product offerings to meet customers' growing appetite for data services.</p>
<p>The gross revenue and EBITDA rose 8% and 5% in constant currency terms. On a reported basis, revenue was up 2% and EBITDA fell 1% due to the weaker Australian dollar.</p>
<p>Pretax profit from the regional mobile associates increased by 5%, with strong growth from Telkomsel, AIS, Globe and Airtel India. Free cash flow declined 18%, reflecting increased working capital to support Optus mobile acquisitions and retention efforts, as well as higher cash tax payment. Also in the same quarter last year, the Group received approximately SGD110 million fiber rollout payment from OpenNet.</p>
<p>So let me just give you some quick highlights of the Group's performance. In Singapore we were named Asia Pacific's LTE Service Provider of the Year by Frost &amp; Sullivan. And Singtel TV continues to improve its content and we now have 135 channels, including the recently added Discovery channels.</p>
<p>Optus' very innovative Cash by Optus app, which lets customers load funds and make contactless payments using their phone, was awarded Best Mobile Solution by ACOMM. Its unlimited fixed data bundles packed with iconic video content also helped Optus almost double its TV customers at the start of the year.</p>
<p>Group enterprise strengthened its market leadership in IPVPN services in the Asia Pac region and continued to boost the suite of international data services, including new software-defined wide area network solutions. We're accelerating the momentum in our cybersecurity business, and together with partners like FireEye and [Alkamine], won many regional contracts. We successfully deployed our enterprise cloud infrastructure and services to support the recently-concluded SEA Games in Singapore.</p>
<p>In the digital space, Amobee leverages Brand Intelligence solutions and we won new customers. HOOQ expanded its presence and is now available in three large Asian markets, the Philippines, Thailand and India.</p>
<p>So, very quickly, if you have the slide pack with you, on page -- slide seven, I just want to highlight that the operating results are very strong and that is despite the fact value losses at Airtel arising from currency weakness in Africa.</p>
<p>The net exceptional gain of SGD47 million was largely due to one-off divestment gains of our venture investments and Bharti Africa's -- Airtel Africa's tower assets.</p>
<p>So, net profit after tax was up 13%. Excluding the exceptionals, underlying net profit was up 2% and would have been 5% on a constant currency basis.</p>
<p>So with that, let me hand over to Yang Fong for your Q&amp;A.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Sin Yang Fong</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Sock Koong.</p>
<p>We will now invite questions from participants. Our operator will assist you to put through your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>(Operator Instructions).</p>
<p>Your first question comes from the line of Luis Hilado from HSBC. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Luis Hilado - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for the call and congrats on the results. I had three questions.</p>
<p>The first was regarding Optus. We've seen margin pressure in the quarter in Aussie dollar terms, but in the MD&amp;A, it doesn't seem to mention any impact from competition. So I just wanted to attest whether it's mostly a benign environment still up to now in terms of competition.</p>
<p>Second question is regarding Singapore. Despite higher acquisition costs year on year, you have seen an improvement in margins year on year and Q-on-Q. What is driving that margin improvement?</p>
<p>And last question is a housekeeping one. The gain on the sale of venture investments, could we get more color on what those -- if those are specific large -- one investment [sold] or several? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe we'll get Allen to take the first question first and then before we take the questions on Singapore and the venture investments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Allen Lew</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Sock Koong. With regard to Optus, I think the first thing is, Luis, the margin compression is primarily due to a higher mix of equipment revenue.</p>
<p>I think the second one -- second question you had, in terms of the competitive environment in Australia, I think it is definitely not one that I would describe as benign. If you look at what the smaller provider Vodafone has done and what the larger provider Telstra has done, I think very quickly, I think Vodafone has got a lot more aggressive in terms of what they're giving away as data allowances and special promotions that are linked on the weekends to these data allowances, is quite aggressive in this network -- in this country.</p>
<p>And if you look at what the larger competitor Telstra has done, I think if you look at three months ago, they have also responded and gone into the BYO market, bring-your-own, where people want to have the flexibility of not being contracted. In the past they had never been in this type of service, now they have started to launch that.</p>
<p>So I think if you look both at the market leader and what the other smaller players are concerning mobile, it's clearly an environment where the level of competitive intensity has increased significantly. And then I think if you look in at the fixed market, Telstra has also readjusted a lot of their fixed broadband pricing and they've gotten a lot more aggressive also into our MDM market.</p>
<p>I think from Optus' perspective, we will certainly know where to position our product on the price perspective bearing in mind the functionality that we can bring to our customers and our brand positioning. But I think the big, big difference between us and some of our other competitors is our ability to bundle not just fixed and mobile but also to be able to make sure that we are bundling a video product together with our broadband services so that we shift the perception of people beyond just price and data downloads.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Luis Hilado - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Allen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Moon?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yuen Kuan Moon</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thank you, Sock Koong.</p>
<p>Luis, I think you're asking about the -- why SAC cost has been pretty flat or slightly increased, the overall cost actually coming down. It's actually due to other cost savings that have come down. For example, traffic expenses have come down, as well as staff cost at our call center has actually improved due to lower call-in rate by our customers because they are doing a lot more [self-help]. So this actually helps improve the overall cost position [inaudible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe, Samba, you take the question on the gains on the venture divestments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Samba Natarajan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure. As you know, Innov8 invests in a number of different digital areas. And these are all investments which are at a very early stage, startup in nature. From time to time we have exited in the form of IPOs or acquisitions of other companies or, you know, and in the course of those exits realized the investment proceeds in the form of gains, and in this quarter we had a few of them which reflect the gain on the sale of those investments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>So I suppose there's nothing out of the ordinary in that this is about the time where a number of the early investments that we have made have come to a stage where they are being IPO and we exit those investments, and the funds get recycled into other new investments that we will continue to make.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Luis Hilado - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. That's very clear.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Sachin Mittal from DBS. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sachin Mittal - DBS</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Thanks for the call. Three questions.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the digital. If I look at the sequential trend revenue decline but gross margins improved, which is quite surprising, so, are there some operating metrics, other reasons, for us to understand why are gross margin improving now despite the lower revenue? That's number one.</p>
<p>Number two. Again related to digital businesses. The handover of AMPed and Dash from digital business to consumer business, what are the criteria? Is it that they're mature enough? And ultimately, is this the plan for all the businesses, that when they're mature they go to the consumer businesses? Is that the kind of criteria over here?</p>
<p>And the third question is on the ICT and managed business, which is -- which saw 4% decline in Singapore but 20% growth in Australia. So, does it mean there's more competition in Singapore or there are some other more dynamics explaining the contrasting trend in the two markets in the same line of business?</p>
<p>And one last question. Last time, I remember you kind of mentioned that subsidies are declining in Australia because people like to buy their own devices, but acquisition costs have actually been quite high in Australia now. So, why is there a change in the provisions so fast? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe, you know, let me -- on the Dash question, as you would be aware, the Dash is a joint venture that we have Standard Chartered Bank, and it is a purely domestic JV in Singapore. As you know, payment rules differ in different countries. So, Dash is a purely Singapore JV. And I think it's got to a certain point of maturity where the service is already in operation. And we think that it makes a lot of business sense, a lot of synergies. Combining it also under the same team, we'll also look at our other mobile payments and remittance services that we have that is operated under the Singapore consumer business.</p>
<p>I think this is something that you would expect to see where some of the services, where they get to a certain amount of traction, one of the original objectives of our Digital Life services was around enriching and enhancing our core offerings. So you will see the management of those services hand back to the core business.</p>
<p>Okay, let me maybe quickly pass over to Samba to talk about the questions on sequential quarter revenues at Digital Life, and then Bill can take the question on ICT, and then we'll pass back to Allen to do the acquisition costs we've seen in Australia.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Samba Natarajan</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. The sequential quarter revenue in Digital Life is largely driven by the performance of Amobee. And actually we're very pleased that we are tracking to our expectations here. The quarter-on-quarter decline is purely a seasonality effect and has been factored in in our quarterly plan for Amobee.</p>
<p>We're also very pleased to see that, as we are getting more experience in the business, we are able to improve gross profit margin and have had a focus on going after accounts that are, you know, we're able to add significant value, improve gross profit. And that's what's now reaping results in the first quarter of this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bill Chang</span></strong></p>
<p>On the ICT managed services business, the question on Q1 is, Australia, we've done 20% growth, in Singapore it's because of a lumpiness of a very large contract in the June 2014 quarter and there is a one-time buyout of this infrastructure and public sector space. So if you take that in account, the trajectory on ICT services is still strong, and I will maintain our guidance at ICT services for the full year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sachin Mittal - DBS</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Allen Lew</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Murray who's the CFO of Optus will answer your question, Sachin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Murray King</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. On the question in relation to subscriber acquisition costs and BYO. Page 26 of the MD&amp;A we actually quote that the selling and administrative expenses are down 8.5% due to lower customer acquisition and retention costs.</p>
<p>To your point, there is a [substantial] BYO marketing in Australia. But having said that, in respect to the postpaid market, there continues to be high levels of handset, customers taking handsets. So, overall the BYO market is important to us, but our selling and administration costs are down more so because of the take-up of our device repayment plans.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sachin Mittal - DBS</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Sachin Gupta from Nomura. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sachin Gupta - Nomura</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. I had two questions.</p>
<p>Firstly, Allen, for the Australian business, Telstra has had another good half and they are looking to invest more as well and maintain the intensity. Then you got iiNet, TPG coming together as well. So I was wondering, what are your thoughts on how Optus is positioned? And do you think you can maintain the intensity of the momentum for the next 6 to 12 months? That's one.</p>
<p>Secondly, on digital business. If I'm reading it correctly, much of the revenue has come from Amobee, but we have losses from Amobee and losses from other businesses as well. Just wondering, why isn't there any revenue contribution from the other businesses? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Allen Lew</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me answer the Australia question on Optus. I think the most important thing here in Australia is to make sure that, as Optus, we basically have a network that meets the needs of the customers here in Australia, particularly on the mobile side, since mobile is such a big part of our business. And as we've guided in the last quarter, we are upping our investment here. And then we'll make sure that at least we have the backdrop and the basic foundation from which to build the other services that will differentiate us.</p>
<p>So I think in terms of how we are positioning ourselves, certainly right now we -- our 4G covers close to 90% of the population. We will in the months ahead densify the network further with the capital investment that we've guided the market.</p>
<p>More importantly, in terms of how we differentiate ourselves, if I can elaborate a bit more beyond what I spoke about earlier, we are trying to shift the needle beyond just competing on price and data allowance to competing on services that we can bundle effectively across our broadband services that we provide to our customers.</p>
<p>So we've done that very successfully in the previous quarter with what we've been able to achieve by bundling with Netflix. We will take that to a different level in the quarters to come. And certainly at the end of day, we will differentiate ourselves. It's not just providing a connectivity product but providing a digital media service that meets the changing behavioral patterns of Australian customers here in this country.</p>
<p>So I think -- I hope that answers your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>On the second question around Digital Life. There are three main businesses which are Amobee, HOOQ and DataSpark [inaudible] digital marketing [with] Amobee, HOOQ and DataSpark are still much more early stage in the lifecycle. And so I think you'd see that over the coming -- in the coming years you'd find that as these businesses scale up, we should be hopefully able to see larger contributions from them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sachin Gupta - Nomura</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Anand Ramachandran from Barclays. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anand Ramachandran - Barclays</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, hi. I had two questions left.</p>
<p>One is a follow-up on Digital Life. Just following up probably on the earlier questions. I look at the sequential EBITDA loss trends. I mean you've gone from, on the restated numbers, gone down quite sharply in terms of EBITDA loss. And I'm looking at the full year guidance of 150 to 180, and I'm wondering whether this has anything to do with the reclassification or overall this is something which you expect to be achieved as losses potentially expand into the year? So that's question number one, that trend I'm trying to understand.</p>
<p>Question two, very quickly, I just wanted an update on Trustwave, and do you have a timeline on when that acquisition gets completed and starts to reflect in accounts? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe Cheng, you want to have the question on Digital Life?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lim Cheng Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure. I think on the Digital Life question, essentially we guided 150 to 180. This got nothing to do with the restatement and the reclassification. In fact if you look at the restatement and reclassification right now, the numbers actually end up better.</p>
<p>But suffice to say what we did was that we had the business rationalization that we announced early this quarter. So the -- in the likes of -- with HOOQ or Dash, HungryGoWhere, all these business were transferred to consumer. So we'll try to provide a more comparable set of numbers. So these numbers were effectively restated.</p>
<p>So if you look at the sharp drop, in your words, really it all comes from the rationalization in terms of -- because of the strategy that we have taken, there may be certain headcounts and cost efficiency that we've taken up, so that also improves the margin.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anand Ramachandran - Barclays</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And so if these trends were to continue, you might revisit the guidance as well, but as of now you're maintaining the guidance?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lim Cheng Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. We have provided the guidance and we have affirmed our guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anand Ramachandran - Barclays</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>[Inaudible]?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Rama, on the question on Trustwave. We expect this to be sometime in August, and pending the regulators' approvals and the contributions to our results, will be sometime in -- will be remaining of the quarter two and which is depending on when it closes, and also Q3 and Q4 [largely].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anand Ramachandran - Barclays</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lim Cheng Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>The guidance that we had provided of course does not include any of the impact of the acquisitions [inaudible] we may start consolidating the results of Trustwave in the second half of the year, and none of that would be included in the guidance that we have provided.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Operator, can we move to the next question?</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question comes from the line of Princy Singh from JPMorgan. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Princy Singh - JPMorgan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thank you very much. I have a couple of questions.</p>
<p>Firstly, on the guidance. Just looking at the numbers for this quarter, I think Australia mobile service revenues are holding out at mid-single digits, around 5% to 6%, and the guidance still being maintained at a low single-digit level. So, does that imply that you're expecting growth to slow down as we go forward into the next few quarters? Or should we be concluding that there is some bit of [inaudible] baked into the guidance?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Cheng?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>We are affirming our guidance for the full year FY16.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I don't think we have any further to add. I mean we are only in the first Q of the financial year, and we are affirming the guidance that we've provided for the various parts of our business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Princy Singh - JPMorgan</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood, understood. Okay.</p>
<p>My second question is on -- so I guess it was a similar question on the Singapore mobile communications where the guidance is mid-single and the number is a 2% growth. So, just in the similar vein, where do you expect things to pick up in Singapore? But I guess going by your answer on the Australia mobile, I guess you won't have much color to share on that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Princy Singh - JPMorgan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that's all for me. That's all for me. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Arthur Pineda from Citigroup. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Pineda - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Thanks for the opportunity. Just two questions for me.</p>
<p>Firstly, can you help shed some clarity on the significant differences between Optus operating cash flow and its EBITDA? What's driving the significant variance and the working capital issues? And should we see that as reversing going forward?</p>
<p>Second question I had is with regards to Singapore SAC trends. It seems like it remains elevated as compared to the previous years, even though the iPhone 6 is already well into the maturity stage. Should we view this as the new norm given changes in handset preferences in Singapore and competition? Or is there room for this to eventually decline? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Murray, can you help with the first question on the cash flow and EBITDA margin at Optus first? And then get Moon to talk about handset preferences in Singapore.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Murray King</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Sock Koong. As you can see on Appendix 3 in the MD&amp;A, in relation to Optus cash flow, the change in operating assets and liabilities increased around odd SGD200 million. This is a consequence of the increased take-up of the pay plans which increases our receivables balance. So essentially that is the major difference between the EBITDA and the operating cash flow. You can also see that the CapEx numbers in respect to cash CapEx at around the SGD300 million reflecting the guidance we provided the market in respect of increased investment in the office -- capital investments program for this coming financial year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Pineda - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>So, presumably that should unwind in the subsequent quarters as well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Murray King</span></strong></p>
<p>In respect of the movement in respect of operating assets and liabilities, it will depend on the takeup of DRP plans in any one particular period, the effect on those assets and liability balances.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Pineda - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And the next question -- sorry.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yuen Kuan Moon</span></strong></p>
<p>Sorry. We have not answered the second question yet.</p>
<p>With regards to the trend of iPhone this year versus previous year, I think there are some differences between iPhone 6 and 6 Plus versus previous iPhone launches. Certainly, of course last year when there was an iPhone 6 Plus launch, effectively iPhone has launched two different phones of different form factor as opposed to previous years which is only phone.</p>
<p>The second reason why we are seeing also a bit higher SAC sustained into the second half of the year is really because many of our customers are also trading up plans, so it's not entirely because of the iPhone but because they are trading up to take on higher data allowance plans for their consumption. So actually the combined effect is driving up the sustained high SAC, SRC for this quarter itself.</p>
<p>And of course going forward we may see a bit of change as we are also seeing this new segment of revenues coming in looking at some BYOD plans, and that would also reverse the SAC trend if more and more people are choosing to buy their own equipment and bringing their own equipment to sign up for plans.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Pineda - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>Is there any guidance in terms of what percentage of the base actually avails of BYOD plans?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yuen Kuan Moon</span></strong></p>
<p>We don't provide the breakdown, but of course we do see that there is a segment of customers who are actually bringing their own phones coming into the market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Arthur Pineda - HSBC</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood. Okay, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Foong Chong Chen from CIMB Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chong Chen Foong - CIMB Securities</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for the call. Two questions from me, both on Optus. Firstly, on the prepaid subscriber decline in the quarter, can you explain or provide more color as to whether this is just merely a clean-up of inactive subscribers or were you doing anything in particular to churn up the lower quality subs in the quarter? And also, was that in any way also driven by more intense completion in the market?</p>
<p>Second question, with regards to your network expansion into regional Australia, could you talk a bit about your plans going forward? Maybe you can provide some base station numbers or in terms of coverage percentage in those regional areas? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Allen Lew</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. I think the first question on prepaid. I think in Optus we focus on making sure we have quality customers that are tolling and are effectively engaged to the network. So the decline in prepaid is due to three things.</p>
<p>Number one, it's seasonal. I think every time around this time of the year, we do clean up our base. The second is basically to -- there was some legislation introduced regarding identification of prepaid customers, and we implemented that in Optus, and that has reduced the number of gross adds that we can get, they're bringing in. And then the third is to make sure that at the end of the day we look at our results in prepaid. If you look at our prepaid ARPU, we still have the highest prepaid ARPU in this market, which is the indication of the fact that we are carefully going through our base to make sure that we maintain only the higher value prepaid customers that effectively contributing in an economical way to our business.</p>
<p>In terms of our regional expansion, I think we have disclosed that certainly we've switched on 700 meg spectrum at 2,400 metropolitan and regional sites. We don't disclose the mix between metropolitan and regional but basically what we have done in terms of our mobile network coverage is make sure we have bought coverage that reaches 90% of the population, because that's where it makes economic sense for us to rollout the network. Further and beyond that I think basically we're also focusing on make sure that where we are in the regional areas, we have a reasonably dense network that allows us to be able to deliver video and other high-speed services to our customers in that region.</p>
<p>I'm afraid I'm not able to disclose to you the exact numbers because we don't share this publicly in terms of regional sites. But certainly in terms of region, well we do identify certain priority areas where there is population and where there is economic links between that particular region and the major metropolitan cities in Australia.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chong Chen Foong - CIMB Securities</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. If I can just add one more question on the postpaid net adds trend adopters, that still looks quite decent into the first quarter. Is that as a result of the market growing or Optus gaining market share away from the other players? And is it fair to say that the net adds for postpaid in 1Q has yet to reflect the recent step-up in competition?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Allen Lew</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, I think the net adds that we see in our postpaid voice and data SIMs basically is a reflection of us taking share from our competitors. That's a very, very small percentage which are new customers in the market. These are mainly immigrants or people growing to get to an age where they are able to take their own postpaid plans. So I think the bulk of those is taking share from our competitors and it's the outcome of the two things that we've done, our data share plans which is getting traction in the market, and the sort of bundling that we've done with fixed and mobile as well as the sort of bundling we've done with video products. I think that's the main reason for our postpaid.</p>
<p>I think in terms of whether it reflects the increased intensity, probably the second half of Q1 does reflect around the changing competitive intensity from both Telstra as well as Voda.</p>

<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Burley - CBA</span></strong></p>
<p>I've just got another follow-up question for Allen. I was wondering if you maybe could just talk a little bit about the retail versus wholesale trends in your business. Obviously in mobile wholesale is quite a big part of that base, 21%, 22% of customers. So, wondering if you could give us an update on what has driven the growth, whether it's retail or wholesale, and some of the different ARPU trends you're seeing in those two parts of the business. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Allen Lew</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks a lot for the question. I think because of the sensitivity of some of my wholesale customers, one of which is also publicly listed now, it's difficult for me to give you further insight and breakdown between what is branded retail and what is whole. I think the wholesale is still a significant part of our business. We are the largest provider of mobile wholesale services. So I think basically at the end of the day the overall growth in our customer base would be a contribution of these two entities. I hope you understand it's difficult for me to share the details between the two at this time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Burley - CBA</span></strong></p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Suresh Mahadevan from UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Suresh Mahadevan - UBS</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, hi. Thanks for the opportunity. I have three questions.</p>
<p>First one is on Singapore. I just wanted to understand how you are thinking about the SIM-only plans of M1 and also potentially and MVNO entry? I mean, are you -- are there any plans to match M1 SIM-only plans? And how should we think about the Singapore mobile market as it gets a little bit more competitive with the MVNO and potentially in MNO? So that is one.</p>
<p>The second question is on your balance sheet. I think your net debt to EBITDA now is around 0.9x. Clearly I think your stated goal is around 1.5, I think if I remember correctly. What are the -- are there any plans to provide some capital management here? That is question number two.</p>
<p>Question number three is on, I think you have definitely given an update in terms of availability in a few of your regional markets. Just wanted to get some color in terms of that service is doing, because it has potentially implications for even some of the other markets. And also any plans of launching it in Singapore? It seems like startup has launched a few OTT kind of offerings, so just wanted to get your sense on that. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Maybe I'll let Moon kick off with the discussion on the mobile market in Singapore first, and then Cheng can talk about the Group's financial position, and maybe Moon can also address whether we are going to get HOOQ in Singapore. And then Samba can just give you a quick overall update on this.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yuen Kuan Moon</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Suresh, thank you for the question. I think one of the -- when we look at the mobile market in Singapore, what we also look at, there are segments serving different needs in the different segments. And definitely SIM only plans or rather BYOD plans is one segment that we are looking into and with the plan of consumers buying phones actually from some of the newer entry phone models that are from China, we are seeing that there is a need to look into to that segment to offer alternative price plans to cater to this group of customer. We will definitely look into it and to see what's the better options to provide flexibility for our customers.</p>
<p>With respect to MVNO I think this is something that's not new. I think it's been around MVNO in the market for a while and they do address certain different markets primarily in the past, some prepaid segments that are targeted as different ethnic groups, different nationalities in Singapore. With new introduction, perhaps later this year more MVNOs will come into the market. We have to see which segment they are targeting and we will then respond accordingly.</p>
<p>The mobile market is definitely competitive and we are always looking and watching the market very closely. More importantly, we focus on our customers to look at what they are looking for and what are the latest requirements that they need to have and we will adjust and produce new plans to meet their expectation and beat their market needs.</p>
<p>With regards to HOOQ coming to Singapore, obviously HOOQ as a video content delivering on a mobile platform is slightly different. We position it first of course in the emerging market where [spec] is an issue, fixed [spec] going into homes is very challenging in terms of this market and watching videos through mobile will be the only way to get [spec] to video content.</p>
<p>In Singapore it's a bit different. We look at delivering video on to mobile and on to tablets, more as a companion, more as an alternative on multi-screen play and with that, in the past we have been doing TV GO service on our tablets initially only for our media contents, but more recently it is actually expanded to provide more content that we have got in our suite of TV services. So we will continue to expand on that. We have got more than 100,000 active users on our TV GO customer base. We'll continue to want to grow that base and we'll look at other OTT offerings that can add on to this particular platform. I believe the other operators in the markets maybe just playing catch up at this point in time and are looking at the OTT market as a new opportunity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bill Chang</span></strong></p>
<p>You asked for a more broad update, just to give you a quick update, we launched HOOQ in the Philippines in April and Thailand in May and we just launched in India last week with our partner Airtel. In all three markets it's a bit of an OTT basis and also bundled with mobile data plans with Globe in Philippines, AIS in Thailand, and Airtel in India.</p>
<p>And our biggest experience right now is in the Philippines where it has been there for little over three months and we're extremely encouraged by the takeup of the offer at the moment and seeing good growth. And we will provide more details in the coming months. I think it's too early to provide any specific numbers right now. And as well as the take up we saw beginning to happen in Thailand as well. So overall, I will say stay tuned as we get more information, but at the moment we're seeing encouraged data.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lim Cheng Cheng</span></strong></p>
<p>I think with regards to our capital management, I think the fact that we're able to go and raise the AUD250 and USD500 that reflects our ability to go out in a very small window to take actually advantage of the rates and the timing that we have. So if you look at the net debt to EBITDA, really that reflects our general working capital and funding needs for the current business albeit for new businesses. So in terms of our broader capital management, we are still looking at the 60% to 75% of our underlying net profit for our dividend policy.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Srinivas Rao from Deutsche Bank. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Srinivas Rao - Deutsche Bank</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thank you very much for the opportunity.</p>
<p>My first question is on the device repayment plans in Australia. It seems that basically what it does it lowers revenue but lowers SG&amp;A and has a positive impact or a negative impact on cash flows. But overall is this something which you prefer compared to the traditional subsidy model? That's the first question. And what is the overall on the financial impact over a period of time? That's first.</p>
<p>Second, if you can, you have mentioned about the agreement on the Australian NBN where -- and TV has been reaffirmed. But there seems to be some change in the payments which you will receive. So if you can throw some more light on that?</p>
<p>And finally on the Group Digital Life, the Ad Tech space which is where I guess Amobee is playing, seems to be getting a bit more turbulent over the likes of Facebook and Google encroaching themselves in this space. Any thoughts on that would also be helpful. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Allen Lew</span></strong></p>
<p>Murray will answer your first two questions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Murray King</span></strong></p>
<p>In relation to your question on the DRP plans and our preference over those, we do prefer them because it gives us the ability to make visible to the customer the full handset cost, so we charge the customer that cost and separate the handset repayment element, the optimum service element. It does have from an accounting treatment point of view, seems to be the result that the subsidy is deferred on to the balance sheet and amortized over the contract term with the customer. However, as we explained earlier, the cash flow implications are the same. So, no difference in respect of a traditional subsidy model versus the DRP with regards to cash flows.</p>
<p>On your second question on NBN, we have reaffirmed the deal with NBN. The majority payments are consistent with what we previously advice the market and that is that we are remunerated upon migration of a HSC customer to NBN Co.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Chua Sock Koong</span></strong></p>
<p>You want to a bit of update on the Ad Tech?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Company Representative</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure. We continue to -- it seems that the digital market is still an attractive market, high-growth market for us. It's also a large global size market, and we think that besides the fact that players like Facebook, Google, Microsoft, Yahoo are the big players in this space, there is enough of a room for several independent players to survive and in fact working on an ecosystem where they work with the publisher side of players like Facebook and Google. So I think we will continue to operate in this space in that growing market.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Abhijit Attavar from Jefferies. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Abhijit Attavar - Jefferies</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you. I was just trying to draw attention back to the sequential of this consumer performance on a quarter-on-quarter basis. I noticed that Optus mobile service revenues are broadly flat, actually down a bit quarter on quarter, but at the same time Optus consumer EBITDA has slipped about 11% quarter on quarter and you attributed that to higher advertising expense and annual increments. So just wanted to understand if this cost elements are kind of seasonal booking impacts or they are more structural in nature, really going for the rebranding exercise?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Murray King</span></strong></p>
<p>In relation to the sequential performance Optus, in relation the March quarter historically a quarter where we have lower cost, the selling cost as a result of the seasonality around the holiday period and the month of February being a shorter month. So as you've indicated in your disclosure there, we said there were high selling cost in the current quarter versus the prior quarter, but majority of that is related to a seasonal element as opposed to an underlying shift in respect of this cost structure in the business. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Abhijit Attavar - Jefferies</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. I'm just trying to understand the implications of the accounting treatment for DRP plans. You said that about $200m difference between the accounting profits and the way the cash flow has shaped up. Does that mean that if you had expensed the entire handset subsidy instead of amortizing it, your Optus EBITDA would have been down by about $200 million? Is that a good assumption or I'm way off the mark?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Murray King</span></strong></p>
<p>No. The cash flow statement I referred to previously, the changes in our asset and liabilities total $200 million. Of that, a part of it is to do with DRP, not the full amount, is to do with DRP. So you can't translate that full amount as a consequence of the ARPU attributed tightly to DRP.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Abhijit Attavar - Jefferies</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. Can I just get a sense of what percentage are we talking about? Its $100 million, $150 million, or can you give us some sense?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Murray King</span></strong></p>
<p>We don't disclose that number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Abhijit Attavar - Jefferies</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. Thank you.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Ramakrishna Maruvada from Daiwa. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ramakrishna Maruvada - Daiwa Capital Markets</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. Two questions for me please, both related to the Singapore enterprise division. I'm just wondering if you could talk a little bit about the mobile services revenues on the enterprise side. You seem to have bounced back again on a quarter-on-quarter basis. So just wondering if you could talk broadly about discounting and competition that you are seeing and at the same time what do you expect will be the longer term trends here on enterprise mobile revenues.</p>
<p>The second one again is on the managed services segment. Bill, I heard your comment with regards to the prior year being impacted by one-off revenue that you had, but if you look at on a sequential quarter basis also, the revenue seem to have dipped. So just wondering if you could talk about is there any seasonality involved in managed services revenues booking. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bill Chang</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you Rama. Let me cover your first question on the mobile. So on the mobile side, its driven by the line count in Singapore and although the ARPU, we do see some of the pressure on roaming and usage, our strategy is obviously to provide a whole experience to enterprises as far as that in cybersecurity, mobile security, we are offering that to ensure the sort of trusted user now on mobile platforms. So that's one key play.</p>
<p>On the quarter four, the managed services numbers, now quarter four it's always the yearend for the Singapore government, so there is sort of yearend procurement exercise, there's always seasonality. Q4 is always a large quarter for our IT business, and as such, if you look at Q1, there is always that effect of [pulling] in. Last year in Q1 there was a large public sector deal that we did a one-off, so that if you remove that, the ICT services is still on a very stronger trajectory and like I said, we'll maintain our guidance for the full year. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ramakrishna Maruvada - Daiwa Capital Markets</span></strong></p>
<p>If I can follow-up, Bill, on the mobile services, so looking now back at the quarter four dip in enterprise mobile revenue, so that is a one-off dip you would issue given that there is a bounce back this quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bill Chang</span></strong></p>
<p>Based on the Q4 numbers?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ramakrishna Maruvada - Daiwa Capital Markets</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I mean your Q4 enterprise mobile revenue seem to have dipped a fair bit. So I'm just --</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bill Chang</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, I'll ask Kuan who's probably the Q4.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Yuen Kuan Moon</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so on the roaming bit -- sorry on the mobile bit, there is also a seasonal aspect when it comes to roaming. So traditionally we look at the Q-on-Q, we look at the Q1, we will have a seasonal high when it comes to roaming revenue.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ramakrishna Maruvada - Daiwa Capital Markets</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, understand. Thank you.</p>
