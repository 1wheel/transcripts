<p>I will now turn the call over to Bob Mariano. Bob?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Mariano</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Jim. Good afternoon, everyone. And thank you for joining us today as we discuss results for the second quarter of 2015. I will briefly review these results and discuss certain key metrics for the quarter. Mike will then review the financial results for the quarter, and at the end of our remarks, we will open up the call for questions.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2015, we exceeded our midpoint net sales and same-store sales guidance, and achieved our midpoint guidance for EBITDA. Total sales from continuing operations increased 5.9% to $998.3 million. The total EBITDA from continuing operations was $30.1 million for the second quarter versus $28.2 million in the prior year. Overall, we achieved our internal gross margin and expense objectives.</p>
<p>The increase in sales primarily reflects the benefit of new and acquired store in Illinois. The increase in EBITDA is a result of a maturing store base in Illinois market and reduced acquired stores startup costs, partially offset by a negative impact from the Easter holiday calendar shift from the second quarter of 2014 into the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Same-store sales from continuing operations declined 3.9% in the second quarter. Adjusted for the affect of the Easter holiday calendar shift, same-store sales declined 2.4%.</p>
<p>Comp sales for the Mariano's banner for the 24 stores open for one year or more during the second quarter declined 6.4%. Adjusted for the affect of the Easter holiday calendar shift, same-store sales declined 4.9%. Compared to the first quarter Mariano’s same store sales improved approximately 280 basis points adjusted for Easter.</p>
<p>We continue to cycle through the cannibalization effect of new acquired store openings in Illinois market and reopening of a significant number of former Dominick's stores that were initially closed in early 2014, and are now operated by competitors. Mike will provide more detail during his review.</p>
<p>Our average weekly sales per store for the 32 Mariano’s stores were $872,000 for the second quarter and were approximately the same as the first quarter of 2015. The average weekly sales per store for the 21 Mariano’s organic stores for the second quarter of 2015 was $944,000 per week per store. We met our four-wall EBITDA objectives for Mariano's during the second quarter.</p>
<p>In addition, we opened two additional stores, one in Skokie, one in Glenview. At the end of 2015 we will have eight stores that have reached maturity at over three years old. We currently have a total of 32 Mariano's stores in the Chicagoland area. At the end of 2015 we will have 34 stores, with an anticipated sales run rate of approximately $1.5 billion.</p>
<p>Comp sales for the Wisconsin markets decreased 2.9% during the second quarter. Adjusted for the effect of Easter holiday calendar shift, Wisconsin same-store sales declined 1.4%, which was relatively flat to the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Although, same-store sales in the Wisconsin markets continue to be negatively impacted by competitive store openings, we have reduced the rate of decline in our Wisconsin markets over the last two years.</p>
<p>As we continue to focus on the in-store experience we provide our customers, in the second quarter and into the third quarter we have introduced our brand refresh initiative in the Milwaukee area for our largest Wisconsin banner, Pick 'n Save.</p>
<p>The initiative called Wisconsin Proud consist of a number of merchandising, marketing and service components, including price investments, television ads, billboards, radio spots, online banners, new in-store signage, new uniforms, messaging on social media channels, as well as new product introductions and other things.</p>
<p>The goal of Wisconsin Proud is to drive traffic. We have seen improved traffic and basket size since the introduction of this initiative for on our -- and our same-store sales in Milwaukee during the quarter exceeded other Wisconsin stores by approximately 260 basis points.</p>
<p>Our ongoing initiatives for growing our perishable business and own-brand product sales continued to do well in the second quarter. Our perishable business accounted for 40.5% of total sales, that’s 117 basis points higher than a year ago and was the highest perishable rate ever.</p>
<p>Our second quarter own-brand sales were 25.6% of total sales, up 140 basis point improvement over last year's second quarter. We have recently added many organic and natural own-brand products to our offering and we now carry over 7,800 own-brand products.</p>
<p>Let me now turn the call over to Mike to provide some additional financial details on the quarter. Mike?</p>
<p><strong>Mike Turzenski</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Bob, and good afternoon, everyone. As Bob stated, consolidated net sales from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 were $998.3 million, an increase of $55.4 million compared to the second quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>Same-store sales from continuing operations declined 3.9%, which was due to a 4.9% decrease in the number of customer transactions, partially offset by a 1% increase in average transaction size. Adjusted for the effect of the Easter holiday calendar shift of 150 basis points, same-store sales declined 2.4%.</p>
<p>Net sales for the Wisconsin markets were $648.2 million for the second quarter of 2015, a decrease of $23.5 million compared to the second quarter of 2014. The decrease primarily reflects the closure of three stores during the fourth quarter of 2014, a decrease in same-store sales and the Easter holiday shift partially offset by the benefits of the new store.</p>
<p>In addition during the second quarter, we close one underperforming store in the Milwaukee area and recently announced the closure of another underperforming store in the Milwaukee market that will be closed in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Same-store sales for the Wisconsin market decreased 2.9% during the second quarter due to a 4% decrease in the number of customer transactions, partially offset by a 1.1% increase in the average transaction size. Adjusted for the effect of the Easter holiday calendar shift, same-store sales declined 1.4% and were relatively flat compared to the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>With respect to competitive store activity in Wisconsin, we had one conventional and two super center store openings during the second quarter of 2015. We anticipate a total of 11 competitive store openings in the Wisconsin markets for 2015, which includes five supercenter openings and six conventional openings.</p>
<p>Year-to-date, there have been five openings and we expect an additional six openings during the second half of the year. We changed our competitive count for 2015 to 11 openings versus 13 as two other conventional openings are now expected to be open in 2016 versus 2015.</p>
<p>As previously mentioned, we expect the negative competitive impact on same-store sales to increase during the second half of 2015. The estimated impact to our Wisconsin same-store sales in the second quarter from new competitive square footage added over the last 12 months was approximately 80 basis points. We anticipate the full year impact on Wisconsin same-store sales related to competitive impacts in 2015 to be approximately 150 basis points.</p>
<p>Net sales for our Illinois market were $350.1 million for the second quarter of 2015, an increase of $78.9 million or 29.1% compared to the second quarter of 2014. The increase primarily reflects the benefit of new and acquired stores in Illinois, partially offset by a 6.4% decrease in same-store sales.</p>
<p>The decrease in same-store sales was due to a 7.3% decrease in the number of customer transactions, partially offset by a 0.9% increase in the average transaction size. Adjusted for the effect of the Easter holiday calendar shift, same-store sales declined 4.9% compared to a decline of 7.7% in the first quarter of 2015. As Bob noted earlier, same-stores sales in Illinois were negatively impacted by the reopening of a significant number of former Dominick’s stores that were initially closed in early 2014 and are now operated by competitors.</p>
<p>The impact related to competitive store openings in the Illinois market was approximately 320 basis points for the quarter. In addition, same-store sales in Illinois were negatively impacted by the cannibalization effect of new and acquired store openings. The effect on several existing stores due to new and acquired store cannibalization was approximately 240 basis points. We will cycle most of these effects by year end.</p>
<p>During the second quarter of 2015, there were three competitive openings in our Illinois market. We expect the total of eight new competitive openings to impact Mariano's in 2015. Year-to-date, there have been six competitive openings and we expect another two openings during the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Gross profit for the second quarter of 2015 increased 5.9% to $263.7 million from $249 million in the same period last year. Despite competitive pressures, gross profit as a percentage of net sales was 26.4% for both the second quarter of 2015 and 2014.</p>
<p>Operating and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2015 increased to $252.1 million from $239.1 million in the same period last year. The increase is due to labor and occupancy costs related to our new stores. Operating and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales were 25.3% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to 25.4% in the same period last year.</p>
<p>For the second quarter of 2015, net loss from continuing operations was $1.4 million or $0.03 diluted net loss per common share, compared to a net loss from continuing operations of $5 million or $0.10 diluted net loss per common share for the second quarter of 2014. Adjusted net loss from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 was $1.1 million or $0.02 adjusted diluted net loss per common share, compared to adjusted net loss from continuing operations of $1.2 million or $0.03 adjusted diluted net loss per common share for the second quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the second quarter of 2015 was $30.1 million compared to $28.2 million in the second quarter of 2014. The increase primarily reflects the maturing store base in the online market and reduced acquired store startup cost, partially offset by the impact of the Easter holiday calendar shift.</p>
<p>When we look at cost data, inflation was between 1.5% and 2% for the second quarter but decelerated as the quarter progressed. During the quarter we experienced inflationary trends in certain commodities, such as beef and eggs, but we experienced deflation in produce, milk and pork products. We expect the deflationary trend for produce to continue into the third quarter and beef has decreased from its historic highs in the second quarter. We estimate that the deflationary pressures will have an additional 40 to 50 basis points negative impact on same-store sales in the third quarter compared to the second quarter.</p>
<p>Capital expenditures for the second quarter of 2015 were $18.8 million compared to $26.1 million in the second quarter of 2014. The company's effective tax rate from continuing operations for the quarter was a tax benefit of 39.5%.</p>
<p>Our total debt at the end of the second quarter of 2015 was $647 million versus $657 million at the end of the first quarter of 2015. The increase relates primarily to payments made on our revolving credit facility.</p>
<p>As of July 4, 2015, we had $39.9 million in cash and cash equivalents and $166 million of availability in our asset base revolving credit facility.</p>
<p>In terms of guidance, we expect third quarter consolidated net sales to be in the range of $975 million to $985 million, with same-store sales in the range of negative 2.25% to negative 3.25%. For the full year we expect 2015 consolidated sales to be in the range of $3.95 billion to $3.99 billion, with same-store sales in the range of negative 2.25% to negative 3.25%.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA from continuing operations for the third quarter is expected to be in the range of $23 million to $28 million, and adjusted EBITDA for 2015 is expected to be in the range of $115 million to $125 million.</p>
<p>For the third quarter, we expect our adjusted net loss per diluted share from continuing operations to be in the range of $0.06 to an adjusted net loss of $0.12, and for fiscal 2015 to be in the range of a loss of $0.06 to $0.17 per share.</p>
<p>Our guidance for total interest expense is $13.75 million to $14.25 million for the third quarter and $55 million to $56 million for 2015. Our income tax rate for the third quarter and full year is expected to be approximately 40%. Capital expenditures for the third quarter are expected to be $20 million to $25 million, and for the full year, $68 million to $73 million.</p>
<p>That concludes my comments. I will now turn the call back over to Bob for some final comments before Q&amp;A. Bob?</p>
<p><strong>Bob Mariano</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Mike. In summary, we exceeded our midpoint net sales and same-store sales guidance and achieved our midpoint guidance for EBITDA. Easter adjusted same-store sales for Mariano's was 208 basis points higher than the first quarter of 2015 and we expect Mariano’s same-store sales to continue to improve as the year progresses.</p>
<p>We reduced our debt by $10 million during the quarter and our liquidity is solid. We introduced the major brand refresh initiative for our Wisconsin Pick 'n Save banner. We opened two new Mariano’s stores during the second quarter. Our perishable sales were up 117 basis points versus the prior year. Our own brand sales were up 140 basis points from a year ago.</p>
<p>We operate in a highly competitive marketplace and we have tailored our strategy to respond to the landscape we operate in. Last year I referred to 2014, it is investment and transition year describing each quarters in both environment. This year we are continuing to see the benefits of having built the foundation in 2014 for continued growth and expansion of our business.</p>
<p>As we continue to strive for sustainable top and bottomline growth, we remain focused on operational excellence across all our banners.</p>
<p>That concludes our comments and at this time, we like to open up the call for questions. Operator?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Edward Kelly from Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Judah Frommer</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, guys. It’s actually Judah on for Ed. I want to ask quickly on the Illinois market. Obviously there is some different types of new competition in there, maybe specifically in the Dominick’s stores. Are you seeing anything differently competitively from those new entrants or the people reentering the market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>No. The entrants would be consistent with what we saw in quarter one.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Judah Frommer</span></strong></p>
<p>Are they doing anything competitively that you might not have expected or is it kind of typical new store openings in the market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>The only thing that -- I mean, the only market thing that occurred was that Whole Foods raised their prices in the produce.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Judah Frommer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And I don’t think you guys have mentioned AlixPartners in little while. Are they still in there and can you give us some update on what’s going on with the reviews if they are?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Alix is no longer engaged. We continue as we report on shrink consistently and we continue that - operate - that effort throughout the business and so that work is ongoing to improve our shrink numbers as well as our profitability. So they gave us the foundation and now we’re carrying the ball.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Judah Frommer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Got it. And on gross margin, if it makes sense, is there anything you could add on gross margin between the Wisconsin and the Illinois markets? Any major differences you’re seeing there rather than you are investing in price in one more than another or that you have to react to the competition one more than another?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>I wouldn’t say there is anything of substances to talk about in the gross relative to the two markets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Judah Frommer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>You are welcome.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Bryan Hunt. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Hunt</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for your time. I was wondering, when you look at the remodeled stores versus the organic stores within Mariano's, can you talk about the relative difference in weekly same-store sales or weekly sales philosophies between the two. Which departments are maybe outperforming in the organic store builds versus the remodels? And I’ve got couple of follow-ups. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, in my fair comments, I did state what the difference was between the organic and the acquired on the same -- on the sales per week. I mean the gap in general I would characterize it in the area of prepared foods because we don’t have all the opportunities in prepared foods. So that would be the most significant difference between an acquired store and organic store.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Hunt</span></strong></p>
<p>And what is the timeline for remodeling and putting on the prepared food departments into those the acquired stores versus the ground-up stores?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the time I mean, the organic stores, they open with all the departments when they open brand new. So the acquired stores we have to remodel. So in next several years we’ll be remodeling the acquired stores.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Hunt</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Very good. And then my last question is there has been a significant push on the labor front, lots of talk of various municipalities pushing for $15 now. Is there any impact you’re seeing on your ability to get labor either in Wisconsin or in the online market currently? And what type of inflation are you seeing up there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>I mean, we're getting the labor that we need. It takes time to get that type of quality we’re looking for. So we’re pretty selective in that regard. In terms of labor pressure to build on your comment, the only city or the municipality that we deal with that imposed higher minimum wage was Chicago and that went to $10. But that had minimal effect on us because our rate was just about a $10 and it was for most people. So, the impact to us was minimal.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Hunt</span></strong></p>
<p>And one more if you don’t mind, if you look at the aging out of the Mariano's banner and the ground-up stores versus the acquired stores are the acquired stores hitting your margin maturity goals in line with the ground-up stores or is there any difference because of the sales mix?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>No. The maturation of the gross margins and profitability, and as well as the OpEx is consistent with what our experience was with the -- is with the organic stores.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Hunt</span></strong></p>
<p>Very good. I will get back in the queue. Thanks for your time.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Karen Short from Deutsche Bank. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Gilligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. It’s actually Ryan Gilligan on for Karen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, Ryan.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Gilligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey. Can you comment on the cadence of sales throughout 2Q and into 3Q?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Through 2Q -- through the second quarter, I would say the cadence was pretty stable, although that does assume an adjustment for the Easter holiday shift in April. And then into the third quarter at this time is still pretty early. And so, I think, at this point everything appears to be tracking fairly close to what we provided for guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Gilligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Did the timing of July 4th impact the quarter at all and do you expecting it to impact the third quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>No. It had a nominal impact.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Gilligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. And then you guys have an early read on the competitive openings for 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>No. I don’t have anything with me at this time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Gilligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>We expect that in Wisconsin though we will continue to be impacted by competitive impacts from this year that are cycling into next year and as well as some new stores that -- new square footage that will open up next year as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ryan Gilligan</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Mark Wiltamuth from Jefferies. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Mandeville</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, guys. Chris Mandeville for Mark. How are you?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey Chris.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Mandeville</span></strong></p>
<p>First off, congrats on the quarter, secondly, just a point of clarity, Bob, did you referenced that, your peer Whole Foods had actually raised the price on produce in Chicago.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Mandeville</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. And then, moving over to inflation, deflation, seem quite the hot topic this earnings season. In that regards, are you seeing anyone in either markets necessarily take advantage of this lower COGs to reinvest in price or do you happen to be doing so, or can you talk to that at all?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it’s been a pretty rational price adjustment to the cost. So people aren’t footballing one way or the other.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Mandeville</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then, lastly, as we look up into Wisconsin, I believe that you said, two supercenters which you alluded to, they actually opened up at the very tail end of Q2…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>That was correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Mandeville</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you talk to what you have done thus far in terms of response, is it simply just the Pick 'n Save refresh? And then I believe you actually had already hired a marketing firm up there to assist you, so if you could maybe provide some color on that? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>All that work is ongoing and it’s in market and it’s continuing to be expanded throughout the state and it’s now becomes a matter of execution. So there is no additional to other than continuing to execute and adjust plan as we go forward. So we have had some positive impact of as a result of Wisconsin Proud and we will continue to work it as we go forward.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Kelly Bania from BMO Capital. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kelly Bania</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good evening. Thanks for taking my questions. Just couple questions on guidance, so I think you called out that some of the competitive openings will shift into next year, you also called the produce inflation, I guess, a little worst than you thought? Maybe just help us think about the puts and takes as we think about that comp guidance, it looks like for the year lower by about 50 basis points, are those kind of the two big factors there, or what really drove the same-store sales change? And then, I guess, related to that, what’s really coming in better for you to able to maintain that EBITDA guidance?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, our terms for the rest of the year, if you look at the midpoint is about 2.7 -- negative 2.75% and year-to-date, I think we’re at about negative 2.8%. So it should be relatively flat going forward. Although quarter two adjusted for Easter was about negative 2.4%. So there is a little bit of a decrease in same-store sales in the third quarter and that is primarily due to the deflation that I had mentioned in my prepared comments.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kelly Bania</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. And can you add any color on the inflation that you are seeing in produce and when you do expect that to get better and how this compares maybe to historical periods that you’ve experienced inflation in produce?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>First of all, our progress is not predictable because by and large, it depends upon the weather. So it’s difficult to say that it comes and fits in sports, sometimes there is rain and then product comes in. There's no rain and no product comes. So you have to kind of work with what you have but to be able to predict for you when and how it’s going to come out similar to other times you’ve got this issue at focus. The answer to this is there is no similarity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kelly Bania</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. That’s very helpful. And then just as I think about your Mariano’s comps, you called out to the impact from the competitive openings from your own cannibalization. If I kind of back that out for your x Easter shift same-store sales, is it right to come to the conclusion that the Mariano's comps would kind of be running under 1%. And is that -- what would be -- how do you feel about that? Is that kind of the right way to think about Mariano's comp excluding all those factors?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think that’s right. If you look at both the combination of the competitive impacts in the cannibalization, you’re right that any store that was on the average stores that were not impacted by competitive hits for cannibalization would run probably in low single -- positive low single digit comps.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kelly Bania</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. I guess, do you have the same numbers for Wisconsin stores, I think you mentioned an 80 basis point impact. So does that suggest that the stores not being impacted by competitive openings are still comping slightly negative?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s right. If you think about again the negative same-store sales in quarter two, we restated again for Easter were negative 1.4%. If you think about that, you back the 80 basis points out and on average, it was still slightly negative.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kelly Bania</span></strong></p>
<p>So I guess, when you look at those, I mean, I know you announced the Wisconsin proud initiative. Do you think that initiative is enough to turn those stores back to positive territory? And then just any color you can add on when you initiated that? How many stores are being impacted and then plans for the rest of the year there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>While we just began in second quarter two and continue to work into quarter three on our efforts. I mean, we told you where the sales were relative to the rest of the Wisconsin stores. So that’s what we were seeing so far. The ultimate outcome is still to be seen and we’ll continue to look at what our goal of course is to get these stores flat and this is a step in the right direction.</p>
<p>So that’s our stated goal in order to accomplish that. And we’ll continue to look at it throughout the rest of the year. Now in terms of expanding it to other stores, there are pieces of it, that we will begin to introduce to other markets throughout the state and we’ll do that as consistently over the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Kelly Bania</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Scott Mushkin from Wolfe Research. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey thanks and thanks guys for taking my questions. A lot of good questions have been asked. But I wanted to just kind of go into both markets a little bit. It’s almost like playing whack a mole here. This year it’s pretty tough with Whole Foods and what they are doing and what their competitive openings. If we look into next year in Chicago, I know you have 32 stores now. I guess, one question is, I kind, of come up a little bit. How many of those 32 stores, if you refresh my memory or kind of what you call product typical Mariano's, and how many need a refresh? And when you’re thinking about refreshing next year, you’re kind of playing defiance this year. Next year, you go on a little bit more offence. So that’s kind of my first question. And then I want to get into Milwaukee.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, there are 11 acquired stores, although really there was one that was really replaced. So I would say there is 10. So by the end of the year, you left 24 organic stores and what I would say 10 acquired stores that still have all of the offerings that inorganic store has.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>And next year we got one remodel schedule.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>One major remodel scheduled for an acquired store.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So we will produce one this year, one next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>And then strategically, Bob, do you said it’s been -- obviously when you get this many opening against -- is the time to go on and off next year as you’ve taken kind of the hit to the proxy through kind of strategically, how you think about things next year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>We are going to continue to -- we’ve got sizes and size new ones in the offer for next year already. They are well underway, two our under construction right now. So next year is well placed. These are great locations and good areas. And we will also add at least one and then if we get, if we have round two major remodeling on the acquired sources. So we are going to continue to work our plan as was stated sometime ago.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>And from a pricing perspective, do you continue to press your advantage on that score or do you -- how do you look at that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>I think we used prices where appropriate. I don’t think our story is only pricing Chicago. I think it’s a much more of a blended value, experience, customer service based type of operation. I mean, some of our competitors prefer went up price because it’s easy to compete on price only, but that’s not where we are headed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>And as far as updating the merchandise, I know even you’re adding more natural organic in, you can bring larger size apples in certain cases or?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>We are on a play court fresh for variety. Just to give you some insight. We now have around this own organic pizza frozen retails for $5 each. Non-GMO organic, it is the top selling item in the frozen food department at Mariano's. And it is imported from Italy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>So very high quality.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So we are going to stay true to live well, chat well, eat well, live well and we are going to make it work and it is working. And we need to continue to press and find outstanding products at a great value for our customers and that’s what this and that will lead to our ultimate successor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>And then as a kind of keep going on this track, what if Whole Foods wakes up one morning, decides, hey, gosh, we can’t have products at 20% above everybody. We need to do something about this.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>I am sure our EBITDA go down a very well. I mean, I could see, and you will see if the EBITDA goes down, the multiple goes down and so what’s Kroger treating at 5 times, 6 times.</p>
<p>Yes, then Whole Foods be 6 times. So if they trade now at 10, they lose 4 points and that’s a market cap. That’s a heck of a haircut. Lot of bowl people running around Whole Foods as that happens.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>And then if I could just think about Milwaukee in '16, obviously we have [Mayer] [ph] open up their DC and maybe open or any stores going into '16. How do we not get a little bi concerned about the southern Wisconsin market, like kind of what happened in the Illinois this year with Whole Foods? Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I would tell you I am concerned I mean because that at any time the competitors comes into your marketplace, you need to be appropriately concerned and take the appropriate measures. And I think we have. And we will continue to evaluate what we’ve done and then where we have to change, we will and the things that are working, we continue to work very, very hard at all. So yes, we’ve got a work cut off for some Wisconsin. We will continue to make it work for us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Scott Mushkin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my questions. I really appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Andrew Wolf from BB&amp;T Capital Markets. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Henrard</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. This is Jeremy Henrard on for Andy. Thanks for taking the question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, Jimmy.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Henrard</span></strong></p>
<p>Could you provide us with a year ago same-store sales for Mariano’s in the Wisconsin market where you can see the two year trend there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. If I heard that right, so last year again it needs to be restated for the Easter shift, but Illinois would've been plus 4.9%. So you're trying to figure out like a two year stacked comp. Illinois would've a relatively flat for the second quarter. And Wisconsin last year was negative 5.3%. And so again a two-year stack for Wisconsin would be about a negative 6.4%.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Henrard</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. Thanks. And could you give us the same numbers for the first quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Last year quarter one for Wisconsin would have been negative 4.9% and for Illinois, quarter one would've been 9.3% last year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jeremy Henrard</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Robby Ohmes from Bank of America. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question"> </span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. This is [indiscernible] for Robby. Thanks for taking the question. Just wanted to ask quickly about inflation or deflation in produce, did you guys see a tonnage lift as prices came down?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mike Turzenski</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I don’t -- I’m not sure that we really did. I’m not sure that we retracted that close frankly at that item level. But I would say that I’m not sure we’ve got a great answer for that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question"> </span></strong></p>
<p>All right. And then just one broadly on the consumer, are you seeing any changes in their behavior, their spending, and does it vary by market?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>I would say, no, we haven’t seen any change in the customer spending pattern. By market, well, there are different patterns in Illinois and Wisconsin, but I mean that also goes for Milwaukee’s all different, then Madison as well. But there has been no significant change over the last several months.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question"> </span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>You welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from Adam Plissner of Credit Suisse. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Adam Plissner</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Just one thing left. Maybe it’s a little more philosophical, but I wanted to speak a little bit about the competitive store openings. And in a sense, maybe in your experience about when you experienced square foot openings and then the impact from new square footage, is there more of an impact at outset?</p>
<p>Or do you find over time whether the competitors are struggling to get the market share that they planned on that this more of a residual lag effect when ultimately that competitive store effect sort of happens in year two maybe rather than year one? And maybe to give us some sense what the lingering impact of some of the store openings will be?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Your assessment is correct and it varies by competitor. In some cases, competitors get the big burst at the beginning and then they tail off sharply and settle down. Others come in very easily and it almost a little to no effect, but they build over time. And it’s important that you understand which one you're dealing with, because it tends to modify what your competitive response needs to be. But you’re correct, there are certain types of stores that behave differently in terms of how they ramp up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Adam Plissner</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And it sounds like more of an experience you’re speaking to in somewhat in Milwaukee. But in terms of your assessment of what might happen in the Chicago area, do you think it’s fair to suggest that the actual new store opening impact at outset is going to be more impactful than maybe the future competitive response?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, it depends who we’re talking about, it depends on which is the competitor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Adam Plissner</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I’m generalizing in Illinois, but…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I mean, I think each of the competitors has a little different mousetrap in terms of how they go to market. But we’ve competed against all these people, so we kind of have an understanding on how we want to go about the fencing our business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Adam Plissner</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks, gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Mariano</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
