Please refer to the Safe Harbor statement included in today’s press release, as well as Cambium Learning Group’s periodic filings with the SEC for complete discussion of the risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed today.</p>
<p>We will be discussing certain non-GAAP financial results including bookings, adjusted EBITDA and cash income. The press release in Form 10-Q issued earlier today contains a reconciliation of these non-GAAP financial results to the most comparable GAAP measures. Because of the high percentage of amortization expense, deferred revenue and other non-cash non-operational items in our reported GAAP income, we report these non-GAAP measures as key performance metrics. Management believes these metrics help portray the underlying trajectory of the business and give you a view of operations from management’s perspective since these are the metrics used internally to assess performance.</p>
<p>Now it is my pleasure to turn the call over to John Campbell.</p>
<p><strong>John Campbell</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Scott. Good morning, everyone and thank you for joining us today. I will review our progress to-date in the year toward our 2015 strategic and financial objectives and Barbara Benson our CFO will take you through the numbers, then we will open the call for your questions. </p>
<p>Let’s get started. Our second quarter performance demonstrated both the normal seasonal build from first quarter as well as our continued execution our strategic initiatives to transform our bookings and revenue mix and our business model toward higher growth, higher margin, technology enabled subscription solutions. As our business is highly seasonal, we look at results from a year-to-date perspective and our first half and early third quarter results are putting us solidly on track to achieve our full year objectives. </p>
<p>First, our profitability is rising nicely, with adjusted EBITDA expanding 38% and margin expanding 657 basis points in the first half of the year and cash income improving as our mix shift towards technology enabled products. This shift is taking place on a cost base that we reduced through last year’s right sizing and we are quickly improving our operating leverage. </p>
<p>Learning A to Z is the standard bearer of our digital transformation and was 38% of first half revenues. This segment continued to lead our bookings growth at 17% in the first half with continued strong performances in our Raz-Kids and Headsprout. Both of these are student centric solutions and the growth demonstrate strong demand for products that put technology directly into students hands, learning A-Z is off to a strong start in Q3.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we launched the next step in learning A-Z product evolution Kids A-Z. Kids A-Z is an online portal and mobile application for all learning A-Z subscribers using our online learning materials including Raz-Kids, Headsprout, Writing A-Z and Ready Test A-Z.</p>
<p>The new platform offers an enhanced kid friendly learning environment, optimize to enhance students learning experience and centralizes access to student resources across our learning A-Z website. It also contains all the classroom management tools and reporting features teachers use to monitor individual and class wide learning progress. Teachers can manage all of their students’ online work and view reports from one place making their lives easier. We are proud of this new platform and believe it will make our learning A-Z products even easier to use.</p>
<p>Learning A-Z’s recognition for excellence continues. We recently received two prestigious awards. The 2015 SIIA CODiE Award for best ELL world language acquisition instructional solution and the 2015 AAP REVERE award for supplemental resources, resources for ELL for the leveled content provided in reading A-Z that support English language learners. These particularly the REVERE award are important as, first ELL make up nearly 10% of the United States student population and second we are making a priority or reaching international students meeting ELL resources, which continues to grow each year.</p>
<p>Voyager Sopris Learning where we are making transformational high return investment in this segment’s technology enabled feature was 48% of first half revenues. Booking in this segment decreased 4% in the first half, while our mix continues to evolve towards technology-enabled solutions. LANGUAGE! Live bookings increased 238% to approximately 7% of first half segment bookings compared to 2% last year.</p>
<p>Our school district customers are drawn to the efficacy of LANGUAGE! Live as they are increasingly looking for way to help struggling students meet the demands of high stake testing. Kurzweil’s firefly bookings increased 29% in the half and we are around 5% of this segment’s booking. Putting this award winning literacy support technology in the hands of more students with learning challenges.</p>
<p>Voyager Sopris Learning also enjoy a very strong presence to a recently relaunched writing programs Step Up to Writing, which answered the needs amongst school districts for quality programs to meet the new rigorous assessments. We are pleased with the progress made by Voyager Sopris in transitioning its mix to newer, higher margin and technology enabled products. Last year we experienced the decline of 20% and this year we expect that decline to be 10% or lower.</p>
<p>We also announced in July that we named Jeffrey Elliott to succeed George Logue as President of Voyager Sopris Learning as of July 6. Jeff was CEO of the Virtual High School and he is the right person to honor the Voyager Sopris Learning mission of working with educators to help them diagnose student needs and provide responsive evidence-based instructional solutions. Jeff’s joining further strengthened our efforts to accelerate our transformation of the Voyager Sopris Learning segment into a provider of ever more powerful digitally based solutions that helps students reach their potential.</p>
<p>ExploreLearning provides powerful online math and science solutions and was 14% of first half revenue. First half bookings grew 1% as we noted last quarter; this segment’s order pacing can fluctuate from quarter-to-quarter because of large deals and renewal timing. We expect growth in ExploreLearning to accelerate in the latter half of the year as this team has a lot of momentum heading into the new school year.</p>
<p>The upgrade of the entire library of Gizmo simulations to HTML 5 is progressing well. The new Gizmo is run on all popular devices used in schools today, including Chrome books, Macs, PCs, iPads and Android tablets. Well over 100 of our most popular Gizmos are already online in HTML 5 and we expect the project to be completed over the next four to five months allowing us to support our teachers and students on all the devices they want to use. To fully support the upgrade and updated modernized Gizmos website has just launched that showcases the capabilities of the new Gizmos and makes the overall user experience easier and more attractive on today’s devices.</p>
<p>We are also launching a new series of game-based Algebra Gizmos this fall. This new Gizmos help students develop a rigorous command of basic but powerful mathematical concepts that will help them succeed in algebra and beyond. The first two new Algebra Gizmos launched this month and more on the way. We’re very excited about this capability and the students are amazingly finding algebra to be fun.</p>
<p>For Cambium in the first half, technology-enabled products grew 15% compared to the first half of 2014 and represented 54% of bookings compared to 49% in the first half of 2014. This mix of technology enabled bookings decrease somewhat sequentially from Q1 to Q2 because of the resounding success of Step Up to Writing, which is now classified as one of our technology-enabled products, although it does come with online teacher resources.</p>
<p>We invested in a revision of Step Up to Writing because we could see the emerging importance of writing in school districts and the product was designed to be easy-to-use, flexible program to guide teachers and students to writing exercises that to be completed in any manner that teacher desires.</p>
<p>We are pleased with its success which affirms that we are addressing market needs correctly. Additionally, this product carries strong margins, which is helpful to our transition. As I mentioned, bookings in July continue to be strong trending up 8% versus July 2014 and we are looking forward to a strong seasonal build as the summer draws to a close and we embark on a new school year, helping students to meet their full potential.</p>
<p>So let’s discuss our second half 2015 priorities. We remain focused on strategic execution, which this year is to invest to build the platform for further companywide growth by leveraging our success and technology enabled solutions and capturing our very large opportunity in the pre-K-12 education market.</p>
<p>As we have discussed with you, education in U.S. today is being disrupted by both common core adoption and rejection with more rigorous testing standards causing students even those who have previously done well to perform poorly and are more challenged students to fall even farther behind as standards get tougher. Further, test scores are increasingly being tied to teacher’s salaries and schools are being evaluated on student’s performance against these harder measures.</p>
<p>As such, we expect common core and other rigorous standards along with rising tax revenue to increase school spending on quality instructional materials. The market data research reports, data of the K-12 market 2014 estimates that total spending on instruction materials has increased to $11.8 billion. This year we see overall growth in bookings and cash income due to continued growth at learning A to Z and explore learning with smaller declines at Voyager Sopris Learning. We further see an increased percentage of our bookings coming from Digital subscription sales, which will fuel improved margins this year and for years to come. Our plan is to continue the transition to more technology enabled subscription solutions to grow this year and to set up a firm foundation for continued growth next year and we are accomplishing our goals.</p>
<p>With our digitized and personalized learning tools, Cambium Learning is uniquely positioned to serve this clear and immediate need for superior, flexible, affective technology solutions that can help teachers duplicate themselves to benefit more learners. Learning A to Z and ExploreLearning each represent over a decade of success developing and growing technology enabled businesses. Our objective is to further increase these segments’ market penetration while transformation our Voyager Sopris Learning segment to mirror this success.</p>
<p>On the solutions development side, we are continuing our transition to a greater number of technology-enabled solutions that are adoptable and individualize to support an individual students’ particular needs. This year, our capital plan calls for the redeployment of $16.5 million to $18 million into high return opportunities to broaden our solution suite at all segments shift to subscription based models at Voyager Sopris Learning and extend our current technology to new platforms and functions across all segments.</p>
<p>On the sales and marketing side, we are selectively expanding our capabilities to support and grow our brand recognition to increase our penetration of existing domestic markets. Particularly at Learning A-Z we are also exploring potential new geographies internationally. Although we are in the early stages of this exploration, we think that Learning A-Z has a number of international opportunities that we continue to explore. Last, we are maintaining careful oversight of our newly right sized cost base to drive margin expansion and cash flow generation to create a higher margin growing business.</p>
<p>In closing, we are executing well on our strategy to leverage our market positioning through our technology capability in order to transform our business and we are building well toward our third quarter seasonal peak. For the remainder of the year, we will continue to live out our beliefs the cornerstones of our value proposition. First, every learner has untapped potential; second, teachers are foundation of learning, their importance must be valued; and third, data instruction and practice drive improvement. We are focused on translating our success as a provider of solution that help all students to reach their full potential to driving strong returns for our stakeholders.</p>
<p>Now I’ll turn the call over to Barbara for a review of the financials. Barbara?</p>
<p><strong>Barbara Benson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, John and good morning, everyone. I’d like to start by repeating John’s note about seasonality. In terms of bookings, revenue and cash income, the first quarter of any year is historically our smallest. The second quarter is a bigger quarter than the first but in 2014 the first and second quarter combined were only around 35% of the full year bookings volumes. And we’d expect this year to have similar pacing. The third quarter is our most important quarter as it kicks-off back-to-school buying. Because of the seasonality and because it looking at any standalone quarter in isolation can be misleading, my comments today like John’s will focus primarily on year-to-date results in trending.</p>
<p>I’ll move on to comment on bookings, bookings for the first half of 2015 were $54 million compared to $52.5 million for the first half of 2014 for growth of 3%. The bookings growth was led by the Learning A-Z segment, which grew 17% consistent with the trending we saw in the first quarter. Learning A-Z represented 33% of the year-to-date volume.</p>
<p>Bookings for Voyager Sopris Learning declined 4% versus the first half of 2014. You’ll recall that Voyager Sopris Learning saw growth in the first quarter due to some accelerated pacing. As expected, in the second quarter, bookings begin to align with our full year expectation of a bookings decline versus 2014. Voyager Sopris Learning represented 57% of the year-to-date volume.</p>
<p>Bookings for Explore Learning grew 1%, as we commented on last quarter, this segment orders tend to not flowing smoothly and we expect them to continue to strengthen as we move further into the year. Explore-Learning represented 10% of year-to-date volume. </p>
<p>Technology-enabled products made up 54% of the first half 2015 bookings compared to 49% in the first half of 2014. We saw growth in technology-enabled products in all of our business segments and overall these products were up 15% over last year.</p>
<p>Bookings for the legacy print-based solutions and our Voyager Sopris Learning segment were down 9% in the first half of the year versus 2014. The decline in the legacy products was partially offset by solid sales of the newly revised and expanded Step Up to Writing program. As John mentioned, the use of technology in the Step Up to Writing program is not as expensive as it is in some of the other new our Voyager Sopris Learning products. So Step Up to Writing is not characterized as technology enabled. The program is resonating well to schools who need to meet more rigorous writing standards and assessments.</p>
<p>GAAP net revenues for the first half of 2015 were $68.9 million compared to $67.3 million in the first half of 2014, an increase of 2%. By segment, Learning A-Z increased 26% and ExploreLearning increased 8%. The GAAP revenues for both of these segments is recognized pro-rata over their subscription period, similar to the GAAP revenues are from the prior year bookings.</p>
<p>GAAP net revenues for Voyager Sopris Learning decreased 12%. The transition to more technology enabled products is expected to slow down the recognition of GAAP revenues through the entire year.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA for the first half of the year was $17.6 million a 38% increase from the $12.7 million in the first half of 2014. The increase was driven primarily by the improved gross margin, which expanded 678 basis points to 66% compared to 59.2% in the first half of 2014.</p>
<p>Gross margin will be favorably impacted as Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning become a higher portion of the revenue mix. Since these segments have a much lower cost of revenues than Voyager Sopris Learning. Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning made up 52% of the net revenue for the first half of 2015 versus 44% of the net revenues for the first half of 2014. Other costs increased slightly around 1% compared to last year with planned investments primarily in Learning A-Z offset by savings from last year’s right sizing actions at Voyager Sopris Learning that lowered our run-rate cost base.</p>
<p>Interest expense was $7.3 million in the first six months of 2015, 20% lower than the $9.2 million in the first half of 2014, due to the $35 million of debt pay downs during 2014. Capital expenditures were $9.8 million in the first half of the year, $1.5 million more than the first half of 2014, reflecting our planned investments in product development in all segments.</p>
<p>Cash income was a loss of $6.8 million in the first half of 2015 compared to a loss of $9.2 million in the first half of 2014. Even with higher capital expenditures we are seeing cash income improvement, as our strategic plans start to payoff. Improvement comes from; one, higher bookings; two, margin improvements gain from having a higher percentage of technology enabled products in the mix; and three, lower cost at Voyager Sopris Learning due to last year’s right sizing actions.</p>
<p>Let’s move to the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents at June 30 were $16.9 million, which decreased from the 2014 yearend balance in line with our historical seasonal pattern. During the first six months of the year, we used cash of $17.5 million with the largest components as follows. Capital expenditures were $9.8 million; $8.7 million of this amount was spent on product development with the remaining smaller portion on general expenditures.</p>
<p>The $8.7 million of product development capital expenditures by segment are as follows. Learning A-Z $3.2 million versus $2.7 million in the first half of 2014, Voyager Sopris Learning $4.4 million versus $3.5 million in first half of 2014 and ExploreLearning $1.1 million versus $0.7 million in the first half of 2014, continuing with the largest components of cash outflow. On February 15th we made the $6.8 million semi-annual interest payment on our 9.75 notes. Our next interest payment is due in the third quarter on August 15th. Other working capital and operational needs roughly offset cash inflows resulting in a cash used from operations of $6.8 million. Again, due to the seasonal nature of our business we are user of cash from all of our activities through the early part of the third quarter each year.</p>
<p>As discussed during our first quarter call, we are aiming to refinance our $140 million 9.75 senior secured notes due 2017 between now and the first quarter of 2016. We continue to evaluate our options to lower our cost of capital, but do not have a more specific update at this time. </p>
<p>I’ll end with our 2015 outlook, we have not changed our outlook but we will continue to refine it as we get further into our seasonally most important time period. I’ll start with our view on bookings by segment. We look for strong double-digit bookings growth in Learning A-Z. We believe growth for Learning A-Z will be in the 20% to 25% range. We expect a bookings declined at Voyager Sopris Learning, but a significantly slower decline compared to 2014 when bookings fell 20%. We believe we can cut the decline rate in half at approximately 10% or less for 2015 as we are starting to see the growth in technology-enabled products and the new writing product start to offset the expected decline in legacy products.</p>
<p>We are targeting an acceleration in ExploreLearning from 2014’s 1% growth to low double-digits growth, likely in the 10% to 12% range. We expect full year overall companywide bookings to increase a bit likely somewhere between the 3% growth we see year-to-date in June and up to 8%. Orders of technology-enabled products are expected to makeup approximately 70% of the 2015 total.</p>
<p>Our outlook for capital expenditures has not changed as John mentioned. To give you a complete picture, product development CapEx is expected to be in the range of $16.5 million to $18 million. By segment, $7 million to $7.5 million at Learning A-Z to support continued strong double-digit growth of the segment; $7.4 million to $8.1 million at Voyager Sopris Learning to support the transition to technology-enabled solutions and $2.1 million to $2.4 million at ExploreLearning to support further development of the Gizmos and reflects product lines. General capital expenditures are expected to be another $2.4 million to $2.6 million.</p>
<p>For adjusted EBITDA and cash income, Learning A-Z EBITDA and cash income margins are anticipated to decrease slightly, but remain at strong levels as we invest for growth. We expect this segment’s EBITDA and cash income dollars to grow. Voyager Sopris Learning margins are expected to be negatively impacted by a decline in bookings the longer cycle for GAAP revenue recognition for technology products and our increased investment in product development.</p>
<p>But, we are seeing a positive impact from the prior year cost right sizing and the product mix shifting to lower cost in technology products. Our goal is to keep margins approximately flat for the full year even with the bookings in revenue declines. ExploreLearning EBITDA and cash income margins are expected to remain strong as we scale the segment. We are investing in this segment for growth.</p>
<p>Overall we expect that margins will increase slightly by a percentage point or two for full year 2015 compared to last year. We are often asked what we think our margins will look like once we complete our strategic objectives. Looking at a longer time horizon in three to five years, we think adjusted EBITDA margins could be 32% to 35% and cash income margins could be 28% to 31%. We expect technology-enabled solutions to make up around 80% of bookings in revenue at that time, which will help drive the stronger margins. This longer-term outlook takes in the consideration our expectation that the Voyager Sopris Learning returns to bookings growth in 2016.</p>
<p>With that I’d like to move on to our Q&amp;A session.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Mary Gilbert with Imperial Capital. Your line is now open, your question please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks, good morning. This is Seweryn Sztalkoper [ph] on for Mary today. Just looking at your gross margins, looks like first quarter and the second quarter are in high 60% range, is that a good way to look at it for the rest of the year or should we expect to maybe to kind of come down more towards like the lower 60s? Aside from that with the Pearson focusing more on education through the divestiture of economist and financial times, do you foresee any kind of risks with Pearson coming into the supplemental space kind of expand their educational offering?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Barbara Benson</span></strong></p>
<p>So, I’ll take the gross margin question first. The way that we always look at that is really by segments and so what we are expecting for Learning A-Z is for gross margins to remain relatively consistent overall margins to contract slightly. ExploreLearning and Voyager Sopris Learning margin should increase slightly. But I think once you throw the mix in there we should... to the extent that more ExploreLearning and Learning A-Z make up a bigger portion of the mix as we expect them to continue to do we should see gross margins start to increase since those are cost of revenues are significantly lower than Voyager Sopris Learning.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>This is John. With respect to your question regarding Pearson I don’t really see a difference landscape, Pearson along with HMH and McGraw Hill have been the big three U.S. education for long time. They’ve always been one of our competitors while we are all are trying to serve districts and students. So I don’t really see a big change there to be honest with you. What I see is us changing and that’s really what our focus is because we are the 6th largest publisher in K-12 education and what we need to do is continue to transform who we are, I don't think there is much change actually going on at Pearson, HMH and McGraw Hill even though they are doing acquisitions or doing divestitures. They are still big players with the big foot print in K-12 U.S. education.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, that's really helpful. If I can kind of follow up on that, is there any kind of... how should we look at working capital this year I know in years passed you’ve been able to generate cash from working capital and if that being so there any kind of way to look at free cash flow should we just expect that to be reinvest into the business like in the technology offerings?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Barbara Benson</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, so if you look at the working capital really the two things that tend to make the bigger splash are accounts receivable movements in inventory. So just to take inventory first, we really did a lot of heavy listing to get our inventory right sized and pull as much capital as possible and still support the business and we pulled significant amount out generating freeing up working capital in prior years $4.9 million in 2012, $7.4 million in 2013 and $3.6 million in 2014.</p>
<p>At this point, most of that right sizing has being completed, we will continue, I would expect to see reductions in inventory as we go through the year as the Voyager Sopris Learning completes the transformation to be more technology products but they are focusing on blend products which still have materials that go with it, consumable materials that go with it. So, I don’t anticipate that continuing to fall with the pace that it has in prior years. I would expect somewhere between 5% to 10% decreases in the coming years. </p>
<p>Accounts receivable, so when we put a booking out or report bookings that’s really an invoice sell and we collect those accounts receivable in 30 to 60 days. So, that will really vary seasonally and will really vary depending on the timing of deal. So you would typically see all things, other things being equal that spike in second quarter and third quarter when we’re doing most of our business and have most of our bookings volume and we typically start to come down at year-end, but again if we did a larger transaction towards the end of the year that’s a little difficult to predict. There really aren’t any -- other than inventory any substantive changes that we’re making in working capital.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. And if I could just do one more. With Common Core obviously as you mentioned earlier in the prepared remarks there has been some adoption, there has been some rejection has there been anything significant since the prior year in terms of projections or adoption? And how should people look at the upcoming elections, I know when a new potential candidate come in they tend to have education on the platform, is there any kind of way you’re viewing possibilities of changes in government and affecting not just the Common Core standards but budget issues? </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. The biggest reaction that we have to the whole situation is Common Core has caused a push towards more rigorous standards and then over the last year or so there has been a push against Common Core. But if you look at it closely state by state, what you see is they replace Common Core with a different more rigorous standard.</p>
<p>So the end result is the same whether you adopt Common Core, you don’t adopt Common Core and that result is the more rigorous standard where suddenly more kids are failing, we’ve seen it over-and-over again where a greater number of the kids who used to do reasonably well or okay are now failing to more rigorous standards, which is driving a greater demand for products that are effective and helping students get up to proficiency. So for us, it really doesn’t matter so much whether they accept Common Core or not what matters to us is are they putting in more rigorous standards and in almost every case that’s what we’re seeing.</p>
<p>In terms of President’s nominations and things like that some afford Common Core, some in fact most are against Common Core or at least one that’s come out against it and again we don’t mind either response, our view is the reality is this push towards more rigorous standards is unstoppable. We’ve come in something like 20th in the world in reading, 30th in math, 24th in science. So how can you possibly accept coming in that day internationally and not want your students in the United States to be more successful.</p>
<p>So, we’re seeing that, we’re seeing districts call for more effective solutions to that requirement really to show that we’re the most effective alternative and that’s the challenge that we have.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator </strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Neil Weiner with Foxhill Capital. Your line is now open, your question please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Weiner </span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning, John and Barbara, great quarter. Couple of questions, one would you mind giving us kind of the breakdown in July of the growth in bookings?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Barbara Benson</span></strong></p>
<p>So, we did disclose in the press release that the bookings were up 8% over prior year July bookings. Really just to give an indication that we were on track for our full year goals, because we were really pleased with the way that the quarter started out. Just because third quarter tends to change every day and it is our most important quarter. We think it would be potentially misleading to go into too much detail about a segment breakout or provide more granular information on that. Other than to say that all of the guidance that we gave today for our full year expectations for bookings everything that we’re seeing in the third quarter is giving us confidence for those full year goals.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Weiner</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. John, can you just give us -- I heard that LANGUAGE! Live was up 200%, some I guess comments or granularity of what customers are saying or seeing and what you’re seeing on this in terms of feedback and what your goal here in the medium terms, in terms of size of that business. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah I can try to give you at least how I view it. And I view it very simply Neil and you know this business pretty well. We have to be successful with solutions like LANGUAGE! Live to show that Voyager Sopris Learning can be a terrific supplier of effective solutions that are technology enabled, that’s not in Voyager Sopris Learning’s previous history. So it’s a very important product for us and that’s why I stress the fact that it was up over 200% in the first half of the year. That to me is us being successful in doing what we said we would do. </p>
<p>And as I look now from my situation, what I focused on more than the sales that we’ve already gotten are the sales that we’re going to get. And looking at the pipeline and how we’re going to play out the rest of this year and quite frankly it looks very strong. And we are in the most important quarter of the year as you know, first quarter is often around 10% or 12%, second quarter is often around 20% or 22%. So the first half of the year is often around 35%, and this third quarter is often around 43%. So the year is very much impacted by each day in the third quarter as it builds towards the end of the quarter. So I look at the pipeline, the pipeline for LANGUAGE! Live is very strong, which to us is very exciting about what we can turn Voyager Sopris Learning into.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Weiner</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. And then can you just give us a little bit of a roadmap in terms of product rollout over the next six or nine months, if that’s been decided?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I can give it to you in general terms. Let’s look at it segment-by-segment if we can. The focus at Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning is primarily to add to the capabilities that we already have. We see a lot of opportunities and things that we could do better, stronger, deeper. For instance that Learning A-Z there is a focus now on the student-centric students, we’re talking about Headsprout, Reading A-Z, Raz-Kids, ReadyTest Writing. So what we’re going to be focused on is how to make those solutions that we’ve been very comfortable with even better for students and teachers to deal with. And part of that as the Kids A-Z solution that we’re coming out with right now to try to make it easier for teachers so that kids log on in one place and teachers log on in one place. And from a business standpoint, we can cross-sell more effectively, because if you have one of our solutions it just makes sense to have all of them because it’s so easy to use together.</p>
<p>When you take a look at ExploreLearning, we have Explore Learning Gizmos, which has been around for 12 years that we’re now having the time and capability and resources to refresh. And someday I’d like to show you the Gizmos that are algebra based that we’ve recently launched two of them and we have a number of them sort of in the pipeline to continue to come out with, they’re just very exciting. I don’t know many products that can make algebra fun most kids cry with algebra. But if you saw these new Gizmos it’s kind of like Gizmos 2.0 in a way. It’s very exciting what we can do and algebra is known as what I could call a gatekeeper subject, it gate keeps kids from being a successful. If you cannot do well in algebra you will not graduate high school. And if you don’t graduate high school your opportunities are very, very limited. So these Algebra Gizmos are extremely important to us and very exciting for us and obviously Reflex has been a success from the very beginning. And there is so much more that we believe we can do with that as a product and as a product line.</p>
<p>And then finally VSL, you know about LANGUAGE! Live and the things we’ve done that so far and we’ll do more. We are also coming out with new product next year. So there is a lot that we have in store all pretty much focused on digital technology enabled subscription solutions in all three segments to drive continued growth and better margins.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Weiner </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. And one last question, do you expect new Reflex products for next year’s school year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>New Reflex products, well, we will have improvement and changes to the current product. We will probably not release the new product next year in Reflex. We will probably focus next year on improving the current product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Neil Weiner </span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks John.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, no problem Neil. Great, talking to you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of AJ Guido with Goldentree. Your line is now open, your question please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Guido</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi John, hi Barbara. Thanks for taking my question. John I was hoping maybe to talk to you a little bit about ExploreLearning and if you can just provide a little color on that business, maybe the mix between Gizmos and Reflex, the retention rate and what you kind of see is the opportunity there, is it more geographic expansion, expanding into new products? I’ve seen everything you’ve done recently with the new website and it all looks good and seems to be doing well on social media. But this business has lagged Learning A-Z and I’m just wondering do you think this could be something that grows like Learning A-Z grew at a 20%-25% range. Do you have any color on that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I’ll take the last question first just to be as clear as possible and then I’ll try to give whatever inside I can on some of your other questions. I’m excited about ExploreLearning. There is a lot of opportunities that we have and your question is first can it grow, the answer is yes and we believe it will grow this year. In fact I believe it will grow double-digit this year even though you haven’t seen it so far. So I wouldn’t say that lightly, I still have a lot of belief as I look at the pipeline, one of the challenges with Gizmos is that it’s very lumpy. So when we make a sale it can be a large sale and often is whole district. They don’t sell very much by classrooms. So you don’t get volume, you get more lumpy large districts buying for the whole district. So whether it falls into one quarter or another quarter can kind of skew the numbers. We also get multi-year deals from them. So you can skew the numbers. So I think the reality is I just want to reiterate to you, so you have a little bit illumination the numbers currently show. We expect Gizmos to grow not only grow in the future, but grow this year and we expect double-digit grow this year.</p>
<p>Right now, Gizmos make up about 70% of our revenue and Reflex makes up about 30%, Reflex is growing faster right now. But as we start to make improvements to Gizmos like the Algebra Gizmos that I shared with you, we expect Gizmos to grow a lot again too. So I do expect both to grow, I also expect Neil handed at this to do newest products in the future and when we think about three to five years out which is a way you want to look at an investment. We intend to do more and more products because I think ExploreLearning has a unique position in the marketplace being considered an innovative provider of solutions that work and not many solutions in education from my perspective somewhat jaded are really innovative. And if you take a look at Reflex or Gizmo's you’ll find really innovative solution. </p>
<p>So will it grow? Yes, it will grow this year. Yes, will it grow faster even and have more opportunities in the years, out years, yes. So has it grown as fast as Learning A-Z? No, quite frankly I think Learning A-Z is a very unique property that’s grown every year for last 11 years and has done fantastic and will we try to make every business unit look like that? Sure. But I think Learning A-Z is kind of unique and it also benefits from being in the reading market, which I think is always larger than the math market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Guido</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks for that and I appreciate it. And if I can ask one more, just John how do you feel a lot of investment over the years to get these products growing within the sales force and do you feel like the sales force is at a level or you can grow or do you still need to expand for Learning A-Z or actually for all the product lines?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Guido</span></strong></p>
<p>Are you talking about the size of the sales force? Just to be clear on the question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Guido</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>I think certainly at Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning we can continue to grow the size of the sales force as one lever in many levers to grow those two businesses. And I say that because if you look at the penetration of our product, the highest penetrated product we have is Reading A-Z at 16%. So to me...</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Guido</span></strong></p>
<p>How accurate the 16% that’s classrooms or...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes sir, that’s classrooms. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Guido</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>So to me, in the history of education there is been a lot of products that have gotten to 90% to 95% if it’s a broad-based products that’s helping all kids which certainly identifies both Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning. So when I take a look at our 16% penetration rates as our highest penetration rate it says to me that there is a lot of growth for ExploreLearning, there is a lot of growth for Learning A-Z, there is lot of growth for Voyager Sopris Learning in the new properties that we have. So will we grow the sales forces I would say yes particularly at what I would call the somewhat less mature businesses of Learning A-Z and ExploreLearning. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Guido</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great, thanks for the time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">John Campbell</span></strong></p>
<p>Appreciate the questions. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
