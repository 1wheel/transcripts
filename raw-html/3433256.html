<p>Before we begin, we'd like to remind you that during today's call management may make forward-looking statements. These statements may include management's beliefs and expectations about the company's future results. Please be aware that they are based on the best available information from management and assumptions management believes are reasonable as of today's date. Such statements are not intended to be representations of future results and are subject to risks and uncertainties. Future results may differ materially from management's current expectations.</p>
<p>We also refer you to Enzymotec's second quarter press release that we issued this morning, and the Annual Report on Form 20-F filed with the SEC on March 2, 2015 for more detailed information on the risk and uncertainties that could have adverse bearing on the company's operating results performance and financial conditions.</p>
<p>During the call today, management will also disclose certain non-GAAP financial measures which are used as supplemental measures of performance. The company believes these measures provide useful information for investors in evaluating its operations period-over-period. For each non-GAAP financial measure referenced on this call, the company has included a reconciliation of the non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP financial measures in its earnings release. Please note that non-GAAP financial measures have limitations as analytical tools and should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for Enzymotec's financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<p>It's now my pleasure to turn the call over to Dr. Ariel Katz.</p>
<p><strong>Ariel Katz </strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Tram, and welcome everyone to Enzymotec's second quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I am pleased to report strong quarterly results as we experienced both year-over-year and sequential growth on both our top and bottom line. We believe that our strength as a company has been proven by our ability to manage the challenges in the market and strong headwinds that are still. While keeping the company profitable and cash flow positive, we are making investments in key strategic areas and the sequential growth demonstrated a growth of our businesses is expected to proceeds through their second half of the year as we remain focused on number of opportunities that will support our long-term growth.</p>
<p>We believe that our strong cash position with over $3 per share in Norway will enable us to make advantages of opportunities where we can leverage our leading lipids technology to fuel the company growth and [transactionally] and drive shareholders' value. </p>
<p>For the quarter the result for our infant nutrition businesses shown continued improvement. Certain market challenges in the infant nutrition and bio-active ingredients market will require the manufacturing of brands to bring more value and depreciation to their product, resulting in unique opportunities and competitive advantage for Enzymotec. As we are well prepared to address these challenges with biopharma we believe this we are taking other appropriate actions to build for visible business. We are extremely encouraged by the yearly sign of increasingly positive growth, which we fully expect to continue as it progresses.</p>
<p>The VAYA product are increasingly being adapted by doctors and patients as we are seeing more traffic in orders going to our online pharmacy. Although it has impact this quarter on the orders coming from the wholesaler, so when you pair the acceptance with efforts to reinforce our infrastructure, expand the sales force and continue investing in clinical research, the VAYA Pharma business is continuing to appear that will be one of our growth engines for coming -- for years to come. </p>
<p>As we look at the large clinical nutrition market, we believe it's our key deep knowledge and technology and on proprietary products will get opportunities for us to consolidated and innovative in this growing market with [indiscernible] innovation. </p>
<p>As we anticipated [indiscernible] [cost] for all of our businesses due to growing demand, we've already seen orders coming in faster than we expected. We are currently focused on increasing our capacity and look forward to finalize on organic expansion of our manufacturing plant in Israel in Migdal Haemek by the end of 2015. In order to meet the expected increase in demand. We plan to reinforce our strategic efforts to achieve sustainability goal and gain market share by continuing to develop superior product and innovative our already robust lipid technology portfolio. </p>
<p>Let we first dive into infant nutrition which as I mentioned earlier we experienced some recoveries during the second quarter, although the market in China and Asia overall remains transaction, we are seeing a wealth of opportunities for expansion. The shift in how infant formula has historically been sold in this market from primary baby shop to an e-commerce platform continues to pose challenges to multinational and other key players.</p>
<p>This shift has reduced the significant barrier for the new brands to enter the market and has given consumers a more proactive role in the decision making. As more players go online and competition increased, the multinational and the other key players will no longer be able to keep the status quo and will need to innovate to differentiate them self in order to stay relevant. We believe that Enzymotec is well positioned to address the customers' needs and provide an essential approach that will be deemed necessarily by multinationals and key players as they search for innovation, distinction in their crowded space that has lacked depreciation. As we have stated previously we remain focused on developing new and innovative ingredients to address current market demand for uniqueness benefit to the consumers and we continue to have discussion with the leading globally infant formula manufacturing about strategic partnership.</p>
<p>China and Asia overall continue to represent a very important market of these global players and they have been engaging with us in most serious discussion as they search for innovation. And while we look forward to capitalize on these opportunities we have been forcing our position in China as well as exploring additional strategically mentioned with other infant formula manufacturing in orders – but on the road such as in the United States and South America. </p>
<p>The local Chinese brand with whom we have strong relation continue to also make strides online via new product introduction. For example bioscience recently launched formula in China with sn-2 palmitat in May. As some of you may know sn-2 palmitat is the scientific name for infant which is marketed by Advanced Lipids our joint venture with AAK. Bioscience entire sales and marketing effort for these products is based on our innovation and clinical war that we generated already in exploring the benefit of infant of baby all which is highly protected. Recent remains the foundation of the company and we have continuing research searching for different ways to leverage our knowledge and technology which will serve as a driver of our goal in the future. </p>
<p>And we feel we established our human needs research center to help us deepen our understanding and further explore the benefit of human breast milk, and to support our efforts to develop new innovative ingredients that are clinically proven. We recently generated new safety data from our preclinical [indiscernible] and we will look to apply this knowledge to work regulatory approval for these product. This study was submitted for publication [indiscernible] and is currently under review. </p>
<p>All our research this we perform support our strong intellectual property portfolio today and we were recently granted new patents in Singapore and expect additional approval in the future. Let me stay on that point for a minute before I move on to bio-active division. Enzymotec has an extremely strong portfolio which is supported by our constant research activity and strong technology and we remain confident that we have very strong IP across all our businesses and in this regards and despite the challenge remember that the USPTO determines that 26 out of the 28 claims Neptune case are unpatentable and we intent to appeal to USPTO decision regarding the two remaining claim in the third quarter. Then say Neptune is not entitled to any royalty payment in North America unless the final outcome according to the settlement in [agreement terms, is very favorable] which will not be determine before the second half of 2016. And in Australia the re-examination of the Neptune's patent is ongoing. And again Neptune is not entitled to any royalty payments unless the final outcome is in their favor. </p>
<p>As you can see we have very good quarter in our krill oil business compared to our competitors who recently reported that they continue to be negatively impacted by the challenges in the krill oil market. Market demand is stabilized in the U.S and Australia but the industry remains burdened by an over capacity fortunately for Enzymotec we have gained significant efficiencies with a production of our krill oil from our new extraction facility which has allowed us to be price competitive in the market. And when you pair that with our higher quality product we have been able to gain market share and as new customers primarily in U.S which back to difference in the overall market. </p>
<p>Furthermore we recently received Novel Food approval from the European commission for our high K.Real krill oil. Enzymotec is currently the only krill oil manufacturing that offers EC-approved krill oil solution in high grade which allows the company customers that purchase our high grade of krill oil to label there product with additional health claims in Europe. Behind this the Standard Health Association related claims of other krill oil. This is a prime example of how we continue to focus on high quality development, research and innovation to leverage our core technology. </p>
<p>Our krill oil is also low in sodium and is the only few krill oil that can be labeled in Europe with claim that a reduction of sodium consumption contributes to the maintenance of normal blood pressure. High sodium intake is associated with high blood pressure which is leading causes of stroke and heart attack. And cutting back on sodium in the diet is a simple way to reduce these risks. </p>
<p>Moving to our Sharp-PS line of products which is our bio-active ingredient that promotes brain health. As I mentioned last quarter we are gaining more attention and interest and we are excited with the launch of several new nutritional products incorporating our Sharp-PS with multinational nutrition companies. Such relations have the potential to increase our Sharp-PS sales significantly. And we believe that there are additional opportunities. Our Sharp-PS is available in [gummy bears] and functional foods such as UHT milk, milk powder and liquid formulas and in flavors like and in other forms and application such as a dietary supplement capsules. </p>
<p>We also have our Sharp-PS drink which is one of the most revolutionary and innovative product in this area, it is comprised of [indiscernible] from the vegetarian [soy] and is eco-friendly, non-GMO and free from soya allergens. Having received [indiscernible] customers can now market and use the Sharp-PS drink in a wide variety of foods and beverage in United States. In other words, we have a very large and strong platform in Sharp-PS that can be tailor made and that potentially lead to more partnerships in this business.</p>
<p>In regards to clinical nutrition business, we continue to make a positive strike as we plan our entry into this market. We believe that this space is prime for consolidation as well as innovation. As it currently stands, this is a $12 billion business with three players who control approximately 75% of the market and the reminder spread across many hands and countries. The industry has been stagnant with very little shift in the market-shares or advancement. We believe that with our pioneering technology combined with our strong financial position we can grow this business organic and inorganic and successfully enter this market and more directly address the market nutrition requirement for this business with special needs. We have identified potential target and we believe that this business will be key to our strategic goal initiative in the future. </p>
<p>Moving to VAYA Pharma, we remain worried about the prospect of VAYA Pharma. We think that we are taking all their operating steps to turn VAYA into key driver of our growth. We decided that this was a year to make the investment into the business and we are encouraged by the initial feedback. We now have the appropriate manager's field and expanded the sales force is in play. The number of sales [operators] has been doubled from the last year and as they get trained and started following [on orders]. We expect them to see the impact of their efforts to heat in the second half of the year. Our sales have continued to increase based on IMS data and remainder that our online pharmacies data is not reflected in the IMS data.</p>
<p>We are seeing more traffic and orders going to our online pharmacy although it has an impact this quarter on the orders coming from the wholesalers. Most of our sales are still coming from the wholesalers, but we may have ways with this directing the business to our online pharmacy. This may have a short-term impact on the ordering level from the wholesalers having our online pharmacy benefit us by allowing us to bring higher margin as well as with better control and contact with end users of our products. We have definitely experienced a very high refill rate with orders that go to online pharmacy, behind VAYA Pharma you heard, we are also making progress in [advancing the tool] in Israel and expected to launch VAYA Pharma product in Ukraine in the third quarter in collaboration with Dexcel Pharma.</p>
<p>And is it the case with our other businesses VAYA Pharma is focused on generating data to continue to leverage our leading lipid technology to expand our indication for our product and address the wide variety of the diseases and disorders mainly related to [indiscernible] and central nerve system caused by lipid imbalance. We have a number of ongoing clinical trials that we hope will reinforce our product capabilities and better target our products offering. We are advancing with our VAYA for long-term study for mild cognitive impairment as well as two other studies on APHD and other one for autism in children. We also announced this quarter that we have and there is still initiative clinical trials for [indiscernible] and managing APHD in children with epilepsy.</p>
<p>APHD presents a very significant market for us as we continue to leverage the results we generated as we pursue additional research and development activity. We are also generating encouraging design from retrospective studies independently performed by the prescribing physician which could not be better way to guide your data as you can see we have a lot of productivity in VAYA and we look forward to its continuous progress. </p>
<p>Before I hand the call over to Oren to discuss the financials, I would like to conclude by saying that we believe that Enzymotec should be recognized for our strong balance sheet, superior operation, wealth of intellectual property and technological leadership, we are fully integrated company with a strong presence in diversified in growing health and wellness market and we have significant growth engines and opportunities. Even with the investment we are committing to the business this year we generated $5.1 million in operating cash flow. So far this is an almost $3 million in EBITDA this quarter alone and return the company to go contractually. </p>
<p>Now I will hand the call over to Oren to discuss the financials. </p>
<p><strong>Oren Bryan </strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Ariel. Before I start, let me remind you of some important information with respect to how we present our financial results. Under U.S. GAAP, we are required to account for the results of operations of Advanced Lipids; our 50% owned joint venture, using the equity method. This means that we recognize our share of the net results of Advanced Lipids as a share of profits of an equity investee. Accordingly, the revenues recognized from the agreement are the amounts we charge to our joint venture partner or our direct cost of production, plus our shareholder joint venture profit.</p>
<p>To provide investors with a better understanding of our performance and for the purposes of segment reporting under U.S. GAAP which requires presentation on the same basis provided to and utilized by our management to analyze the relevant segments results of operation, we account for the results of operations of Advanced Lipids using the proportionated consolidation method. Under the proportionated consolidation method, we recognize our proportionated share of 50% of the gross revenue of Advance Lipids and record our proportionated share of the joint venture cost of production in our statement of operations.</p>
<p>And now let me discuss our financial results for the second quarter ended June 30, 2015. Based on the proportionated consolidation method, net revenues increased 43.6% to $16.5 million from $11.5 million for the second quarter of 2014. Based on the equity method of accounting, net revenues increased 49.5% to $13.4 million from $9 million for the second quarter of 2014. The increase was primarily due to an increase of $2.3 million in krill oil sales an increase of $2 million in infant sales proportionated consolidated method and an increase of $400,000 in sales of VAYA product and an increase of $300,000 in the sales of PS product. </p>
<p>Gross margins in equity method for the second quarter of 2015 decreased 100 basis points to 61% from 62% for the second quarter of 2014 primarily due to change in product mix. </p>
<p>Selling and marketing expenses for the second quarter of 2015 increased to $2.7 million from $1.9 million in the second quarter of 2014 and from $2.4 million in the first quarter of 2015 primarily as a result of expanding VAYA pharma operations and infrastructure.</p>
<p>General and administrative expenses for the second quarter of 2015 increased to $2.2 million from $1.8 million in the second quarter of 2014 and from $1.5 million in the first quarter of 2015 primarily due to an increase in litigation cost related to the arbitration with AAK. While we expect the litigation expense to continue in to the third quarter it will be less than this quarter and we still anticipate resolution with AAK to conclude by year end. </p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA increased 147.5% to $2.9 million from $1.2 million for the second quarter of 2014 and increased 7.5% compared to the first quarter of 2015. Net income increased to $2.3 million or $0.10 per diluted share from $400,000 of $0.02 per diluted share for the second quarter last year. </p>
<p>Non-GAAP net income increased to $2.7 million or $0.11 per diluted share from $500,000 of $0.02 per diluted share for the second quarter of 2014. </p>
<p>And now for the six months results ended June 30, 2015, based on the proportionated consolidation method net revenue decreased 12.3% to $30.9 million from $35.2 million for the same period a year ago. Based on the equity methods of accounting net revenues decreased 7.9% to $24.7 million from $26.8 million for the same period a year ago. For the six months ended June 30, 2015 gross margin equity method decreased 40 basis points to 61.3% from 61.7% for the same period a year ago primarily due to change in product mix</p>
<p>For the six months, selling and marketing expense increased to $5.1 million from $4.2 million for the same period a year ago primarily as a result of expanding VAYA pharma operations and infrastructure. Net income decreased 27.1% to $4 million or $0.17 per diluted share compared to $5.5 million or $0.23 per diluted share for the same period a year ago. Adjusted EBITDA for the six months decreased 27.1% to $5.6 million compared to $7.6 million for the same period in the prior year. </p>
<p>And as we noted in the press release, we are updating our guidance for the full fiscal year 2015. For the full year we expect net revenues based on the equity method of accounting to be between $53 million and $59 million, and net revenues for 2015 based on the proportionated consolidation method to be between $66 million and $74 million. </p>
<p>We expect non-GAAP net income for 2015 to be between $6.5 million and $8.5 million, and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share to be between $0.28 and $0.36. As a reminder, non-GAAP net income represents net income including share-based compensation expenses and unusual income or expenses. Non-GAAP diluted earnings per share are diluted earnings per share based on non-GAAP net income.</p>
<p>With those comments complete operator please open the line for questions.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of John Baumgartner from Wells Fargo. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Baumgartner</span></strong></p>
<p>I'd like to ask about the PS drink maybe how you're thinking about usage in foods and beverage products. I mean how you plan to market this in terms of approaching the manufacturer? What has your research shown about the market opportunity? And what types of products we can look for this PS drink to really target?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ariel Katz</span></strong></p>
<p>Sharp-PS is -- previously used as a brand health product, but since it's as important first for lipid and key components, we have seen more and more uses of this product in other uses. So for example, we have a launch on several launches on using UHD's milk for kids in [indiscernible]. We had product in the spot nutrition having this type of product. So there are many, many applications that can use this product for different uses.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Baumgartner</span></strong></p>
<p>And then maybe in terms of [indiscernible] can you just say what’s the process there now it's in clinical trials, what are some of the milestones we should be looking for, any cost associated with that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ariel Katz</span></strong></p>
<p>As we published we have several clinical trials running which are the long-term clinical trials. We have two clinical trials on ADHD with others that we probably expected to see in some initial results next year and well they are having much more targeted and where we can see the benefits and we have additional clinical trials specific for epilepsy kids because those kids have -- high percentage of them have ADHD disorder as part of the disease, but also they have limitations that you stimulant. So this is unmet need that we may address and again we’ll expect to see the results probably next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Baumgartner</span></strong></p>
<p>And then Oren just last question in terms of forward guidance for sales, there wasn’t much of a change to it and I guess despite this new bioscience product rolling out and it sounds as though the Krill market is getting little bit better for you at least is there any reason why guidance wasn’t increased for sales? Any risk you're seeing and you should be more conservative here?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Oren Bryan</span></strong></p>
<p>What we this quarter following the results of the first six months and with some one-month in the first quarter what we did is we actually changed the guidance or narrowed the range of top-line both in equity method and proportionated method to reflect that then the new guidance with the narrowed range is our best estimate for the rest of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Laurence Alexander from Jefferies. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Jeff on for Laurence. Just a question on R&amp;D it looks like it's running at run rate that’s roughly flat year-over-year. Do you expect looking out the next couple of years that R&amp;D expenses will increase as you continue to trial and just look to refresh the portfolio as you will normally do?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Oren Bryan</span></strong></p>
<p>You are right, that this quarter we had a flat R&amp;D expenses and also when we compare it to the previous quarter. But as you said we anticipate R&amp;D expenses to increase as we continue to perform the clinical trials we just reported and Ariel just mentioned and the spending -- Enzymotec spending on R&amp;D specifically in bio segment should expect to increase overtime.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And quickly on the capacity expansion, can you just elaborate a little bit more on the cost and the timeline for completion?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Oren Bryan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes we reported that we are doing an organic expansion, it means that we are increasing the number of pieces of equipment that we have in our current manufacturing plant. We announced that this is being done until the end of the year. So during the first quarter we should see some impact of increased capacity but it will be finalized during the fourth quarter of this year. Most of the spending has already been done about 70% to 80% of the cost of this expansion has already been expensed and as I said, it will be finalized during the end of this year, until the end of this year.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of [indiscernible] from Bank of America. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Couple of questions first back to John's question about PS-Green. Is it viable to use in products that are heated in meaning, could you put it into a baked product or does it just have to go to a powdered from. Just trying to understand the range of applications that it might be used for. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ariel Katz</span></strong></p>
<p>The range of application is very wide because we have different [ways], so it can be liquid form, it can be powder form, it will be in different concentration level. So basically I will not say no limitation but the amount of the application is going to use the product is very, very high. </p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>So we could go into anything from a drink to a snack bar to a breakfast cereal right? Is that the way to think about it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ariel Katz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes you can think that is very wide uses.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And then in terms of if the -- if you could just give us a little bit more color on the clinical trial. And I guess trying to understand just how this -- what you think the timeframe will be before you maybe get to some sort of conclusion. And then assuming a positive outcome what happens then, does this make it more prescribe covered by insurance. Just if you can kind of just walk us through those two things. What type of timeframe we should be thinking about and then assuming a positive outcome, what that actually would mean?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ariel Katz</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay so regarding the research, I assume that you mainly focus on asking about the VAYA product. Although we have research in the infant nutrition, but our first answer the questions regarding research with VAYA, take into consideration that we have medium term and long term. Since our products are well accepted and the results are encouraging there are many physicians are doing retrospective studies. For example it was publish by Texas neurology the results of retrospective [indiscernible]. So all these retrospective studies that we are helping them to generate some data and make new patents around it actually supporting our short term and helping us to bring evidence and doctor's experience how to use our products to the market. </p>
<p>Regarding the long term and which as I said we have different trials and we have two clinical, we just ended the clinical trials for VAYA which we [indiscernible]. And we have very, very positive results as we consider now how to leverage it. And we have head to head with Omega 3 which is similar to Lovaza and we had a very positive result. </p>
<p>And regarding the wiring we have two clinical trials on ADHD. So we're speaking about leverages to use with adults which is totally new category but also to have better targets to the doctors where they should expect to see the result. </p>
<p>Than we have epilepsy which is unmet need and based on the retrospective results as we got and then we have [indiscernible] that we are already conducting trial and expecting next year to get result. So basically the target is to bring more information, better targeting and expand the users of the product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And then just one last one for you Oren. Just tax rate, it was a little bit different than what we were modeling, just could you give any perspective at all in terms of maybe what you're thinking about in terms of the tax rate for the full year guidance?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Oren Bryan </span></strong></p>
<p>The tax rate for the full year should be the same, we expected not to change compared to the six months result.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay so same effective tax rate used in the first-half for the full year.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Scott Van Winkle from Canaccord. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>It's Mark [indiscernible] on for Scott. Was wondering what kind of underpins the better earnings guidance, you have treat earnings up certainly toward the high-end of the previous range on a relatively consistent revenue outlook. So what parts of the business kind of give you that confidence?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Oren Bryan</span></strong></p>
<p>You should remember that we’re not making the guidance we look on the six months results already that we secured and we have one month in the third quarter. So our previous guidance for non-GAAP net income was $5 million to $8 million and we are already quite close to that to the low end of this previous guidance. With focusing the second half of the year, we decided to increase the guidance for the bottom-line to $6.5 million to $8.5 million and we feel that this is the best estimate for our results for the full year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And then in terms of the European approval on Krill, what are the expectations for kind of the broader European market, how should we be thinking of it perhaps in a comparative context to the U.S. or Australia where you're already well established?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ariel Katz</span></strong></p>
<p>It's very hard how at this stage do put a very specific model, but we believe that the [indiscernible] we currently have health claim in Europe and are the only one that have received and in combination with the VAYA products will allow us either to go to supplements market, but maybe expand this business also to clinical nutrition business and having the claims is crucial and elements that we adjust in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And that’s all the questions that we have in the queue at this time. So I’d like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Ariel Katz</strong></p>
<p>Thank you everyone for your participation in questions and for your support. We look forward to updating you on our progress on our third quarter call in the coming months. Have a great day. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you again for your participation in today’s conference. This now concludes the program. And you may all disconnect your telephone lines. Everyone have a great day.</p>
