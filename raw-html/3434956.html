<p>Thank you. Good afternoon and welcome to Civitas Solutions Inc.’s third fiscal quarter 2015 earnings conference call. I am joined by Bruce Nardella, President and Chief Executive Officer; and Denis Holler, Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>Before we begin, if you do not already have a copy, our press release with financial statements can be found in the Investor Relations section of our website at www.civitas-solutions.com. Please be advised that today’s discussion includes forward-looking statements including predictions, expectations, estimates and other information that might be considered forward-looking. Throughout today’s discussions we will present some important factors relating to our business which could affect these forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>The forward-looking statements are also subject to the risk and uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially from the statements we make today. We are not obligating ourselves to release any update to these forward-looking statements in light of new information or future events. As a result, we caution you against placing undue reliance on these forward-looking statements and would encourage you to review our filings with the SEC for a discussion of these factors and other risks that may affect our future results or the market price of our stock.</p>
<p>We will be referring to certain non-GAAP financial measures such as adjusted EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA margins and free cash flow because we believe such measures are appropriate ways to discuss our financial results. However, please remember these are non-GAAP financial measures and should not be considered alternatives to other GAAP measures such as net income or income from operations. I refer you to our press release issued today detailing our third quarter results for comparable GAAP measures.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll turn the call over to Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Nardella</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Dwight, and thanks, everyone, for joining us on today’s call to discuss the results of our fiscal third quarter. We are very pleased with our financial performance in the fiscal third quarter and our continued ability to carry out our long-term growth strategy. Our financial results are highlighted by another quarter of solid growth driven by a strong organic growth in our two largest service lines, I/DD and SRS, as well as what continues to be a very active year for acquisitions.</p>
<p>But most importantly, as we continue to grow, we continue to fulfill our mission by providing high quality cost effective services to more adults and children in need of support. But before we focus on the operational and financial highlights of the quarter, I want to provide a brief update on the state budget and rate environment, which remained very stable in nearly all of our 30, 35 states.</p>
<p>Revenue collections for fiscal 2015, which ended in most states on June 30, exceeded projections in nearly all of our larger states, including in our largest state Minnesota, where revenues for the fourth quarter alone are estimated to have exceeded the state’s February forecast by more than $450 million. Among our top 15 states, West Virginia is the only exception to this otherwise positive state revenue performance, as FY 2015 tax collections finished just short of budgeted estimates.</p>
<p>State budgets for fiscal year 2016, which began July 1, in most states, have been established in most states. And the news has been fairly positive with regard to funding for the services we provide across our 35 states, we remain in a very stable pricing environment. While it appears that the impact from across-the-board provider rate increases, we’ll be more modest in fiscal 2016 than it was in the last couple of fiscal years in several states, including Florida, New Jersey, and Ohio, provided funding in their new budgets to expand community-based services for individuals with intellectual and developmental disabilities.</p>
<p>This includes initiatives to transition individuals from public institutions into the community and also reduce the number of individuals who are on a waiting list for services. The biggest concern for us with regard to state policy is in the state of West Virginia. At the same time the state has to confront budget challenges, it is in the midst of renewing its I/DD waiver program, as it is required to do every five years.</p>
<p>We are keeping a close eye on the proposed plan, which still requires approval from CMS, as it would make significant changes to the waiver in an effort to control costs, families, providers, and advocates have all been outspoken in raising concerns. As we craft our plan for our fiscal 2016, we’re doing so with the goal of mitigating the impact of any changes in West Virginia.</p>
<p>Now, turning to our financial results, I want to briefly touch on the highlight for the quarter before turning the call over to Denis for more detail. Net revenue for the third quarter ended June 30, 2015, was $346 million, an increase of 8.7% from the year earlier period. Approximately 43% of net revenue growth was organic with acquisitions making up the balance. Adjusted EBITDA increased 13.8% to $39.1 million. These strong third quarter results reflect growth through selective acquisitions, as well as strong organic growth.</p>
<p>During the third quarter, we acquired five companies, bringing the total number of companies acquired during the first nine months of fiscal 2015 to 10. The five companies were acquired for a total consideration of $6.8 million. Four of those companies acquired in the third quarter are part of our human service segment, and provide a mix of residential and supported living services to individuals with intellectual and developmental disorders. The fifth acquisition adds to our Post-Acute Specialty Rehabilitation Services or SRS segment.</p>
<p>Moving forward, our overall M&amp;A pipeline remains robust and I am pleased that this now includes a pipeline of Adult Day Health or ADH companies. Since entering this adjacent service last year via the acquisition of a platform company in Massachusetts, we have remained very enthusiastic about the potential of this new service line, as it is consistent with our mission of serving individuals in the least restrictive community settings and provides a strong value proposition for our payers and families.</p>
<p>Our ADH programs in Massachusetts, including the two new starts begun since the acquisition, have performed to our expectations and we are continuing to explore opportunities to expand our ADH footprint via organic and acquisitive growth. Our I/DD and SRS services, which generated approximately 65% and 20% respectively of our total net revenue in the third quarter of fiscal 2015, continue to perform very well with increases in both volume and average daily rates in the quarter compared to the same period the previous year.</p>
<p>For the third quarter 2015, I/DD gross revenue grew by 7.5% and SRS gross revenue grew by a strong 14.6%. As expected, our services for at-risk youth contracted. For the third quarter, ARY gross revenues were down $2.3 million or about 4.5% compared to the third quarter of 2014. As has been the case in the last couple of quarters, the decrease in revenues was primarily due to the reduction in our non-residential periodic services in North Carolina, resulting from statewide redesign of these programs.</p>
<p>In addition, our Illinois ARY programs declined approximately $1.5 million compared to Q3 of fiscal 2014. And as we announced during the third quarter, both North Carolina and Illinois are in the group of six states, where we are exiting ARY services, excluding the operations being discontinued in all six states, ARY gross revenues would have increased 3% in third quarter compared to the same quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>Before I summarize the year-to-date results, I want to provide a bit more context with regard to the future of our ARY services, following the recent completion of a strategic review of this service line. While we are reducing the size of our ARY footprint from 14 to 8 states, which we expect to contribute just north of 10% of our total revenue once each of these transitions is complete, we believe our actions including the establishment of a new Center of Excellence for Children and Family Services, composed of child welfare experts, will enhance our position as a national leader in serving youth-at-risk and their families.</p>
<p>We also believe that our actions will improve the financial performance and predictability of the ARY service line. Our decision to divest these operations is consistent with our strategic commitment to build leadership positions in our areas of strength. I am confident that these changes will make us better provider in a stronger company. Our ARY programs in Illinois ceased operation in May, and we continue to target our fiscal year-end on September 30 to complete the transition of ARY services in each of the other five states. So we may have to extend that timeframe to ensure the safety and well being of each young person transitioning to a new provider. This action will have no impact on our I/DD or SRS services provided in these states.</p>
<p>Looking at our year-to-date results, we’re pleased with the progress and growth we’ve achieved so far in fiscal 2015. During these nine months ended June 30, 2015, net revenues have increased 9.4%, including 15.3% for our SRS segment. We completed 10 acquisitions, with total annual revenues of approximately $38.5 million. We have taken action to strengthen and stabilize our ARY service line and we paid down debt and strengthened our financial position, which has resulted in enhanced free cash flow.</p>
<p>And finally, because our growth and financial performance is, of course, contingent on our service quality, clinical outcomes and client satisfaction; I want to take just a moment to highlight the results of a new study of our evidence-based ARY periodic Family Centered Treatment services or FCT in the State of Maryland.</p>
<p>Previous research has supported the effectives of FCT. And the results of this evaluation, which was independently led by the University of Maryland School of Social Work with funding support from our company, underscore the effectiveness and cost efficiency of the FCT versus those served in residential group homes. We expect that the university will soon release a full report.</p>
<p>At this point, I would like to turn the call over to Denis Holler, our Chief Financial Officer to discuss our financial results in more detail. Denis?</p>
<p><strong>Denis Holler</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Bruce. I may refer to the quarter ended June 30, 2014 as the prior quarter and the quarter ended March 31, 2015 as last quarter. This quarter, the growth trends that have driven our business in the first two quarters of the year continued for the most part. Our I/DD and SRS sectors continued their grow trajectory both in total and organically.</p>
<p>Our ARY business has continued to lack, but the contraction in revenue is stabilizing compared to the prior quarter. New starts continue to drive growth in revenue and margin expansion, but to a lesser extent than prior quarters. There were no significant out of period adjustments that affected our results this quarter. Our expense related to our health care plans has increased to anticipated levels, but still contributed margin expansion this quarter.</p>
<p>Finally, working capital and accounts receivables collections remain positive, although DSO is about flat for the year compared with last year when we saw a significant improvement and the positive impact on free cash flow. As you will see, free cash flow for the quarter was robust, but I will be explaining a revision to the free cash flow number we reported in the second quarter.</p>
<p>Moving to the results, for this quarter net revenues grew by $27.8 million or 8.7% over the third quarter of last year. The increase included $12.1 million from organic growth and $15.7 million from acquisitions. Our Human Services segment, which contributed 80.5% of our total revenue, increased 7.4% over the prior quarter. Our SRS segment, which contributed 19.5% of third quarter revenues, increased 14.6% over the prior quarter.</p>
<p>Trends remained positive in volume and average rates for all of our service lines with the exception of the volumes in our at-risk youth business. This fueled our organic growth. This quarter I/DD gross revenues grew by 7.5% with more than half of that organic or 4.4%. SRS gross revenues grew at a rate of 14.6% with more than half of that organic or 7.9%. ARY revenues decreased by 4.5%, which was less than the prior quarter when they declined 9.5%, mainly as a result of the contraction of services in North Carolina.</p>
<p>Organic growth continued to be driven by the maturation of new starts. New starts started between fiscal 2012 and this quarter contributed $6.5 million of the growth in revenues or about half of our organic growth in revenue.</p>
<p>Investments in new starts declined from the prior quarter coming in into total spend of $1.4 million as compared to $1.8 million for the prior quarter. On a trailing 12-month basis, we invested $5.4 million compared to $6.1 million for the 12-month period ended prior quarter. As you know, this moderation was anticipated off of peak investment levels in 2012 and 2003, but is expected to continue in the current range going forward.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA grew by 13.8% over the prior quarter with 4.1% coming from organic sources, in addition, our adjusted EBITDA margin improved by 50 basis points to 11.3%. Some of the important components of this net improvement are as follows.</p>
<p>It now appears that our high deductible consumer-driven healthcare plan design is gaining traction with our employee base, as more of our employees are utilizing the plan appropriately. We started to see this trend of increased claims in March and it is continued through the third quarter, although there is still a bit of uncertainty with this plan. We expect claims will level off but continue at the current higher level. This should stabilize our healthcare spend as a percent of revenue.</p>
<p>Despite the increasing claims activity, healthcare expense for the quarter was approximately $800,000 less than the prior quarter, which translates to a positive impact of 50 basis points on our EBITDA margin.</p>
<p>Continuing the trend from last quarter, we did not leverage direct labor. Excluding the impact of lower health expense discussed above, direct labor consumed an additional 40 basis points of margin.</p>
<p>The main cause of this increase was overtime, which is typically an indicator of increased vacant positions and turnover. We have started to see increased competition for labor in some markets, and as a result, last year, instituted our variable pay plan for direct care employees.</p>
<p>As we mentioned last quarter, we are contemplating a potential expansion of that program, should we have the capacity to do so. Continuing the trend from recent quarters, occupancy costs increased absorbing 50 basis points of margin. Although this has happened for a number of reasons in the past, this quarter it appeared to be isolated to lower occupancy in our I/DD service line, in both our waiver group homes and intermediate care facilities. This reduction in occupancy was not isolated, but appears to be temporary.</p>
<p>Continuing the trend from the last two quarters, we continue to experience a reduction in sales adjustments to our revenue. Net deductions from our revenue declined by approximately $440,000 over the prior quarter and contributed about 25 basis points to our margin. Finally, we were able to continue our trend of leveraging general and administrative expenses, including indirect labor, in the quarter which accounted for 30 basis points of margin expansion.</p>
<p>Net income for the quarter was $0.6 million compared to $5,000 for the prior quarter. This increase or the increase in net income was primarily due to lower interest expense resulting from the refinancing of our senior credit facility in January of 2014 and the redemption of our senior notes in October of 2014 using the net proceeds from the initial public offering. This reduction was more than offset by the increase in stock-based compensation expense of $1.3 million and $8.2 million impairment charge, resulting from the planned disposition of our at-risk youth businesses in North Carolina, Texas, Florida, Indiana and Louisiana. The increase in our stock-based compensation expense came from an employee incentive plan established in connection with our IPO.</p>
<p>Earnings per share was 1% for the third quarter ended June 30, 2015, compared to zero for the prior quarter. However, excluding the impairment charge related to the ARY closure states indicated earlier, earnings per share would have been $0.14. This quarter we are revising the free cash flow reported in Q2 from $16.3 million to $10.2 million. And the year-to-date free cash flow reported in the second quarter from $1.7 million to a negative a $4.4 million. The $6.1 million difference was due to the erroneous inclusion of the contingent consideration for the Castle acquisition and the change in liabilities on the statements of cash flow.</p>
<p>This quarter, free cash flows remains strong, coming in at $24.7 million and $20.4 million on a year-to-date basis, these numbers compared to $32.4 million $42.4 million in the prior year. The reduction in free cash flow was caused for the most part by the significant improvement in days sales outstanding on accounts receivable in the prior year, which was approximately 3.5 days, compared to the relatively flat performance this year at around 42 days. We were 42.8 days at quarter end.</p>
<p>Also significant were the IPO and debt refinancing costs which were incurred this year, but did not impact the first three quarters of last year. Capital expenditures for the quarter were $10.6 million or 3.1% of net revenue, which is in line with our expectations and consistent with both last quarter and the prior quarter. Typically, we experienced a higher CapEx spend in our fourth quarter, however, which is why we have set our guidelines at 3% to 3.5%. Year-to-date capital expenditures are running at 3% of net revenue.</p>
<p>Finally, this is the first quarter where our net leverage dipped below four times as we came in at 3.91 times, our trailing 12 month adjusted EBITDA of $150.2 million.</p>
<p>Now, turning to guidance for our fiscal year ended September 30, 2015. We are narrowing our net revenue guidance range, which was $1.345 billion to $1.385 billion to between $1.355 billion and $1.375 billion. We are confirming our existing guidance range for adjusted at between $152 million and $154 million. Last quarter, we announced that in response to wage pressure in some states, we were considering an expansion of our variable pay program for direct service employees in the event that we exceeded the top-end of the EBITDA range.</p>
<p>This is still our view and as a result, the top-end of our adjusted EBITDA range of $154 million will likely be a ceiling on our results for the fiscal year. The revenue and adjusted EBITDA guidance includes the operations of the ARY businesses slated for closure or divestiture, but does not include any one-time expenses, which will be treated as an add-back to adjusted EBITDA.</p>
<p>And with that, I will turn it back to Bruce.</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Nardella</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Denis. In summary, we are pleased with the performance of our business as we enter the fourth quarter of fiscal 2015. Our industry dynamics are attractive. We are executing on our proven business model, and we’re excited about the opportunities that lie ahead. I’m very grateful to all of our outstanding workforce and thank them for their continued hard work and dedication, and I would like to thank all of our shareholders. I look forward to keeping you updated on the Civitas story as we move forward. So thank you all.</p>
<p>With those comments, we’d like to open the line up for questions. Mike?</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, sir. We will now begin the question-and-answer session. [Operator Instructions] The first question we have comes from AJ Rice of UBS. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Hello, everybody. A couple of questions, if I could. First of all, on the five states that you’re leaving, I guess, six states in total. Illinois, it sounds like that was pretty much out of the revenue contribution for the entire quarter. And I know you gave us some percentages that would bag us into that. But do you have any actual number of how much revenues these five incremental states that you’re leaving contributed in the quarter that will go away, presumably, after the – in the next fiscal year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t have a quarterly number for that revenue right now, we’ll look at momentarily AJ.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>For an annual or whatever if you have it, I don’t know…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Annualized, all the states together is about $52 million in annualized revenue, that will go away.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right. And…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I just want to be clear AJ on that that’s with five.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>All right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>And I believe Illinois was, because that actually was the first one to go, that was divested at the end of May, that’s about $9 million additional.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That’s helpful. And when you look at the remaining states, are those – how would you characterize those, those ones where you’re pretty confident that you’re going to be there for the long-term, or is there still some uncertainty in those, as well? Give us some sense of what the review yielded on the remaining states?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we feel pretty strongly about those remaining states. As you know, we’ve had a history throughout our 35 years of selectively pruning here and there. But it’s been very infrequent that we undertake such a comprehensive strategic review of one specific service line like we did in this instance.</p>
<p>So, if there were things that were on the bubble, we wanted to really poke at that and make sure that we did our due diligence there. So I feel that we made the right decisions on what is now the six states and I feel very good about the eight remaining.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then on the deal activity, it looks like you spent about $45 million year-to-date in the last year, I think, the aggregate total was in the low- to mid-50s. I know sometimes at year end, there’s a big push to do a number of transactions, other times, there’s a moderation to the activity. Can you tell us what you think you’ll see here in your fourth fiscal quarter, and that you will exceed which you did last year when it’s all said and done?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, last year was an exceptional year. It’s one of – last year was one of the probably three in our entire history that we hit the $50 million plus marketing acquisitions. So that would be very ambitious. I’m not going to give forward guidance on the balance of the year. We – as I said in my earlier comments, it’s a very active pipeline, aided by the addition of the 88 service line, but you know, how these things go. You work on a lot of deals. Some of them across the finished lines fairly quickly, others get delayed for extended periods of time for a whole variety of reasons.</p>
<p>The good thing is the pipeline is active, who knows where we will end up throughout the balance of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And I may have missed this, I’ll step out for one second. But could did you give an update on what – activity with the VA under the SRS umbrella, how that’s going?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, as you know, it was renewed again, but it has – it’s been fairly modest. We haven’t recovered all of the censuses that we once had, when we were in full swing, before the threat of the reauthorization really was coming into play leading up into the fall of 2014. So it’s picked up, but it’s still not at its peak to where we were before. We continue to work on that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">AJ Rice</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right. Thanks so much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next, we have Josh Raskin of Barclays.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks. First is a quick one, West Virginia I/DD, how big of a revenue source is that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s about – trailing 12 months, it’s about $79 million, Josh.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. You mentioned obviously the renewal process. I think that comes every five years. That seems to be customary. Were you just highlighting that as normal course of business or is there something, or is there specifically that you want to call out and make sure we were aware of?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the reason why I called it out is, because that is an outlier in an otherwise very positive stable environment. That’s the primary reason and since it is $80 million of revenue, it bears close watching. And that the sort of CMS review is far from over, as I understand it, but we’re watching it very closely.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then, on the sort of the overall I/DD business, we’ve heard some of the Medicaid managed care companies, some others start talking about I/DD. And it’s sort of the first time I’ve heard them doing that. Are you seeing any new competitors yet or are you seeing even small acquisitions done by some of these guys or anyone trying to get into that market more seriously?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, actually, we have seen none of that activity. I’m not saying it’s not out there, but we really haven’t bumped into it at all.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So everyone you’re bumping up against is folks you’ve seen in the past?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then, just last one for me, I just want to make sure I got the self-insured health care question. It sounds like, I think, Denis, you said it was $800,000 in the quarter, better than expected…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>No, Josh, it was $800,000 less expense in the quarter than the prior quarter. However, because of the expanding revenue basis is it had a positive margin impact.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. And then just basically, you’re seeing – you guys were expecting – you’re seeing lower-than-expected healthcare cost on your self-funded on your employee population, correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. What we are seeing is that the levels are increasing. And remember, we went through a period where we’ve taken some very substantial true-ups, because there was underutilization in the plan. That turned around, but the trajectory of that was such that it was still positive year-over-year, but we’re seeing that – I mean, obviously there is some uncertainty as we go forward. But we’re seeing those claims coming at that higher level, they seem to be moderating and we see the variance sort of settling down.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Oh, I guess, maybe this is what I think about it, relative to your expectations sort of three months ago, did you book more or less the self-insured expense?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>We booked exactly our expectation and we didn’t have an offer from underutilization indicating that the usage is coming up.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joshua Raskin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Got you. That’s perfect. Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next we have Kevin Fischbeck with Bank of America Merrill Lynch</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joanna Gajuk</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey, good afternoon. This is actually Joanna Gajuk playing [ph] for Kevin today. Just couple of clarification questions, so towards the end of your prepared remarks you talked about excluding some one-time costs from your, I guess, EBITDA guidance, are you referring to the $7 million of exit cost that you call out in your 10-Q? There was a sentence talking about $2 million of termination costs and $5 million of lease termination costs so is that...</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. That is the maximum amount, assuming that we were to close those businesses. Those would be one-time costs. We expect to mitigate those, particularly if we’re able to divest the unit to another – or the units to another buyer. So then, that would then take the employees and take the leases, we would not have to do that. So that – I believe it was a $6.7 million number and that was an upside number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joanna Gajuk</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. But you were [indiscernible] you were saying that you would exclude anyway, if they were smaller?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. If we had one-time, I was making the point that in our guidance, and in our adjusted EBITDA are the results of the revenues and expenses of those businesses. But we have one-time cost of exiting those would be treated as bad tax. We this quarter wrote down the intangibles, which you saw about $8 million, and that obviously is already in the amortization line, so did not have to be added back.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joanna Gajuk</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. That was my other question. So because you raised your <strong>D&amp;A</strong> outlook for the year, that’s pretty much this time at this quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It took the amortization from the impairment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joanna Gajuk</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. And then in terms of the organic growth for the entire enterprise, so it’s about 4%, 3.8% or so, that’s somewhat lower than the last three quarters, the organic growth was more closer to 5% or about even a little bit more than a 5%. So, is there anything to talk about here in terms of any aberration, or is it because of at-risk youth business, or anything that, any color you might give?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, certainly that’s contributed. We have talked about the moderating of the new starts, particularly as that large cohort from 2012 and 2013 gets into our numbers. But both of those are factors and the rest of is just ebb and flow the business. We are very bullish on the internal growth rates in the mid single-digits.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, and, Joanna, this is Bruce, just hit on that other point that you made about at-risk youth. We were backwards by 4.5% this quarter compared to the last, same quarter of last year. That gap was actually narrower to your point that 2.1% less revenue in our second quarter 2015 compared to our second quarter 2014. So, it was a narrower gap, it gapped up to a 4.5% less in revenue. And frankly, the biggest part of that was from the two states Illinois, which we have divested during the quarter, and North Carolina, which we will be divesting. That was essentially responsible for all of the reverse momentum.</p>
<p>And you’re right, that was a higher number than the previous quarter Q2 2015. But that had an impact on the organic growth of the company, because as you know all of the growth or reverse momentum in ARY is all organic, because we haven’t done acquisitions in that space for quite some time. Now, the organic growth of the company without the six states would have been 5.2%. So, I think, that’s more reflective of more sort of important reflection of our organic growth rate.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joanna Gajuk</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Those are helpful. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next we have Paula Torch of Avondale Partners. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paula Torch</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you. Good afternoon. I wanted to start off asking about maybe the I/DD business in New Jersey, Florida, and Ohio, you mentioned those three states and transitioning individuals and seeing some reducing waiting list. So, I was just wondering how many individuals that might be, and what kind of bump do you think we could expect benefit from in 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Well, we think these are substantial, probably not as quite as large as the two to three-year project that we saw from New Jersey from 2011 through 2014. But we do think they are substantial. Now, just to be clear in that case of California, the governor has requested of the legislature to submit a plan for closing, at least, one, if not more developmental centers.</p>
<p>So, there is ways to go on that proposal. But in the case of Florida, it’s about a $40 million increase to enroll about 2,000 people, that is substantial expenditure, particularly for the state of Florida in this – for this population. New Jersey is almost $20 million just shy of $20 million additional expense, and that’s about a 180 people coming into community placements and about another $4 million to address the waiting list of people that are waiting for services who are currently probably residing in family homes. So it’s hard to predict how much we were going to get. But frankly, compared to where we stood at the beginning of fiscal year 2015, this represents three more opportunities that we have seen of this size going into last year.</p>
<p>Ohio is also significant, because the legislature sought to delay the closure of two developmental centers, and the Governor, Governor Kasich vetoed that legislation. There are currently 180 individuals in those two centers. And that also funds another 2,000 people on what they call an individual auctions waiver and then 1,000 people on self-empowered life funding waivers over the next two years to assist people on the waiting list, and that – and some people who are an ICFs, more intensive programs, who might be eligible for less intensive residential care.</p>
<p>So Ohio was probably one of the bigger opportunities we’ve seen in probably since the New Jersey de-institutionalization effort.</p>
<p>Now, how much we’re going to get? We have to deliver consistently high-quality all the time. I feel good about that in all of those states and we’re going to be competing with our local competition, just as we have in the past, like in the New Jersey initiative, but I’m hopeful we’ll fare very well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paula Torch</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you for that color. And just so maybe as a quick follow-up on that. Does that maybe refocus a portion of your potential new start business in maybe those three states because of this opportunity?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>It very well may.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paula Torch</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Okay, great. And, maybe I could just turn to ARY for a quick second. I know that you discussed this earlier in the call. Just assuming the remaining ARY businesses are hitting the criteria that you’ve mentioned the financial and the quality, you’ve discussed this before. I’m just wondering, as you looked at that business more carefully, did you also raise the bar on either of those criteria in the remaining states in a sense to sort of better maximize the remaining business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, they have demonstrated, those remaining states, for the most part have demonstrated some consistently high quality service delivery and dependability on their financial performance. We’re going to make sure that they continue to do both of those things. And as long as they continue to do that, I think we’ll be just fine.</p>
<p>And frankly, as I indicated, if you strip out the six states, we got a little bit of growth in there at 3%. Now, we’d like that to be higher, but I think we’ve been pretty consistent in saying that because of the nature of the turnover in services, because you’re dealing with children, that’s about what we’re going to expect; low single to middle digit growth in the ARY.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paula Torch</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you for that. That’s very helpful. And then, maybe lastly on just Adult Day Health. As you’re turning the corner on the year of having that acquisition under your belt, just wondering what you see as some of the biggest opportunities in that business and what maybe some of the biggest challenges you might be facing there. And as we think about investments, what kind of investments do you need to continue to making staff CapEx and/or technology to enhance the service line?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we like what we see. As you probably know, each and every state has an Adult Day Health waiver. Just like with our other service lines, we have to be very careful about the policy language surrounding those waivers and also the specific reimbursement surrounding those. We’ve targeted a handful of states probably a good five or six states, for real aggressive activity grow them both through acquisition and organic growth. As I explained, that we’re already experiencing the organic growth in the current program that we have.</p>
<p>As far as the challenges there, there will be very similar to some of the challenges that we’ve seen in our human service business that we’ve got to be able to recruit and retain very good direct service staff. If we can do that, we will do very well on this service line.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paula Torch</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then, just quickly, and in the current state that you’re operating, I know you talked a little bit about organic but do you also see some M&amp;A potential there as well. Is that included in the five to six states?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Paula Torch</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thank you. That’s it for me.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Next we have Richard Close of Canaccord Genuity.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Close</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thank you. Congratulations on a good quarter. I was curious if you could – we could talk a little bit about the specialty rehab area, it seems like things are going very well there. Can you just comment a little bit on the organic growth in there, what’s specifically driving there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. We’ve had a pretty good run, Richard, of deploying our new start investments in that space. And what you’re seeing is some of the maturation of that, particularly, in our more medically involved into the business CareMeridian, that has a different, sort of, investment cycle we’re dealing with developing programs that have 25 to say, 32 patients in them. So it takes you a little longer to get that capacity online. But once you do that, then you can get to work in filling them up and that’s some of what we’re seeing there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Close</span></strong></p>
<p>And then with respect to new starts on a go-forward basis, obviously, we’re currently ramping up and seeing the benefit, I guess, from fiscal 2012, fiscal 2013, if I’m not mistaken. Do you guys, as you look out a couple of years, do you see any acceleration on the new start program in the near-term, or in fiscal 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I think, as we stated in the past, we’re probably on a path to be investing anywhere from $5 million to $7 million a year now, anyway, those years of 2013 and 2014 were hyper investment. It’s hard to look beyond the next year or two. For example, what drove our hyper investment in 2012, 2013 and 2014 was New Jersey. We didn’t have visibility on New Jersey until about six months into 2011.</p>
<p>Now, I’m hopeful that some of the projects that I just mentioned whether it’s Ohio or Florida, or with New Jersey bringing more money to the table, that may, although, we’re not sure that may create a bit of an uptick in 2016, but it remains to be seen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Close</span></strong></p>
<p>And then just, as you look at your pipeline of acquisitions, can you give us any contacts in terms of whether they’re skewed anyway towards I/DD or the adult day, or specialty rehab?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, those are the three areas. And, frankly, it’s hard, because we have different phases of our pipeline early prospecting, frankly, early prospecting, it’s probably evenly split between those three. So it’s hard to say, but there’s fluctuations in the pipeline at any given time. But, I guess, I would answer the question by saying, I’m impressed by the amount of opportunity that continues to be there in those three service lines.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Close</span></strong></p>
<p>And I guess, just a final from me is, would there be any other service lines, maybe that broaden your offering included in there, anything that you’re not necessarily and now that you are contemplating expanding into?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we have been – we have stated publicly in the past that we will always look at opportunities to broaden our footprint. We’ve spoken specifically, for example, about youth on the autism spectrum. We remain sort of active in researching those opportunities, but there’s probably a higher bar for us to jump into a new service line beyond what we have right now, but we’ll continue to poke around.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Richard Close</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. Thank you very much. Congratulations.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Next we have John Ransom of Raymond James.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Ransom</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, guys. Most of my questions have been answered, but and I’m sorry if I missed this. But if you look at the quarter and if you were to reset all of your acquisition activity for the beginning of the quarter, and I know AJ touched on this and then strip out all of your discontinued ARY business. Do you have an – just a ballpark of revenue and EBITDA kind of going – run rate going into the September quarter?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bruce Nardella</span></strong></p>
<p>I don’t have that right at my hands right now, but we can certainly get that to you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Ransom</span></strong></p>
<p>And then secondly, you mentioned what a big year it is from an acquisition standpoint that you have a number for this year kind of the range of EBITDA multiples you’ve been able to pay for these deals from low to high?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It’s – I think, it’s range probably from a low or probably around two to a high of around five.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Ransom</span></strong></p>
<p>Two times EBITDA?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes. Believe it or not, a number of the smaller acquisitions often come very cheaply.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Ransom</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That’s pretty good. And then lastly, do you – is there a structural reason that your deal activity has picked up as if you’re hunting in four different spaces, is it animal-spears [ph], is it something else. And do you think this could be expected to continue, or we’re going to look back on these past years and see these as high watermarks?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, one of the reasons why we were so bullish on the IPO, John, is because of the improvement in the capital structure we did that, and frankly, we’ve made some investments in our M&amp;A capacity. So we’re glad to see that we’re putting that investment to good use.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Ransom</span></strong></p>
<p>So how many people do you have hunting for deals at the moment?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Denis Holler</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s roughly seven.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Ransom</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That’s all I have. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Well, at this time we’re showing no further questions. We will conclude our question-and-answer session.</p>
<p>I would now like to turn the conference back over to management for any closing remarks. Gentlemen?</p>
<p><strong>Bruce Nardella</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, thank you again for your interest in Civitas Solutions, and I look forward to speaking with you about our year-end results. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And we thank you, sir, to the rest of the management team for your time also today. The conference call is now concluded. At this time, you may disconnect your lines. Thank you, and take care, everyone.</p>
