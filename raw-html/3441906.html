<p>Joining me on this conference call are Achim Kaufhold, our Chief Medical Officer; David Veitch, our Chief Commercial Officer; and Donato Spota, our Chief Financial Officer. I would like to note this call contains forward looking statements.</p>
<p>At the beginning of 2015, we outlined our objectives for the year and I&rsquo;m happy to report our major achievements thus far this year. We&rsquo;ve recently launched Zevtera in four of the key European markets include Italy, France, U.K., and also now Germany.</p>
<p>Isavuconazole received U.S. approval for the treatment of the invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis and was launched under the trade name CRESEMBA in the United States by our licensing partner Astellas.</p>
<p>We are excited about the European CHMP positive opinion for approval of isavuconazole as a new treatment from invasive mold infections. A final decision from the European Commission is expected in the coming months and we are preparing for the launch isavuconazole in Europe starting early next year.</p>
<p>We reported the isavuconazole for active for the top [Indiscernible] in our analysis and discussions with properly used to access potential use of be the [Indiscernible] invasive Candida or these infections.</p>
<p>In the second half of this year we expect to report initial phase 2a data for our tumor checkpoint controller BAL 101553 is being evaluated in solid tumor patients who do not respond to card therapy. We are also in active negotiations for distribution licensing partnerships and collaborations to expand the commercial availability of Zevtera and [Indiscernible] beyond our core markets.</p>
<p>I will now turn this time over to Achim who will update you on our development program thereafter David will give you more insight on our commercial activity; then Donato will provide you financial highlights for the first year and guidance for the full year.</p>
<p><strong>Achim Kaufhold </strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ron. In addition to the important regulatory milestones for isavuconazole gaining approval in the U.S. and the positive opinion from the CHMP for approval in Europe, invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis we reported topline data of the phase 3 ACTIVE study for invasive Candida infections.</p>
<p>The ACTIVE study showed clinical results in line with previous studies that demonstrated overall response rate at the end of IV therapy of about 70% for echinocandins was 60% for azoles or amphotericin B. [Indiscernible] of invasive heat infections lack of oral dosage and there remains an unmet medical needs for efficacious and phased for therapies.</p>
<p>The ACTIVE study did not meet its primary endpoints of non-inferiority overall response at the end of IV therapy, however its met the key secondary endpoint. The key secondary endpoint was overall response at two weeks after the end of therapy.</p>
<p>We are currently evaluating the potential role of isavuconazole as a treatment of invasive Candida as such as an over stepped out option where isavuconazole compares favorably against the currently used azoles fluconazole and voriconazole.</p>
<p>Ceftobiprole was just granted U.S. qualified infectious disease product designations for the treatment of community acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial skin and skin structure infections. We are planning to discuss type 3 protocols with the FDA later in the year to prepare for a U.S.A. 3 program under a potential collaboration.</p>
<p>The contracts with the U.S. BARDA for our Gram-negative antibiotic BAL30072 will be completed at the end of the initial funding period as agreed between BARDA and Basilea. Under the contract a phase I study was conducted with intravenous BAL30072 in combination with the carbapenem antibiotic meropenem.</p>
<p>During phase I development transiently elevated liver enzyme levels were observed as the dose-limiting factor. We are discussing further development options with potential partners and collaborators including additional antibiotic combinations and new dosage forms such as inhaled form. There is a high medical need for inhaled antibiotics targeting from negative infections that affect cystic fibrosis patients.</p>
<p>They are expected to improve patient&rsquo;s quality of life by reducing lung infections, improving lung function and overcoming antibiotic resistance which frequently occur with these patients. I am happy to report that during the first half of the year we had strengthened our oncology portfolio. For our tumor checkpoint controller BAL101553 we are looking forward to the read out of the phase 2a i.v. study in advanced solid tumor patients this year.</p>
<p>The selection of tumor types included in this study of biomarker expression data from epidemiological studies in tumor banks. From this study we are looking for data to determine the best dose for phase 2b. This year we also initiated the clinical development program of the oral dosage form. The availability of an oral formulation of BAL101553 offers increased flexibility with regards to both single agent and drug combination treatment strategies across different tumor types.</p>
<p>Given its good brain penetration we are also planning to develop the drug for the treatment of glioblastoma, a type of brain cancer. Our second oncology drug candidate the panRAF kinase inhibitor BAL3833 enters phase 1 clinical development in advanced solid tumor patients. Substances from this novel class of panRAF kinase inhibitors that are active in tumors which have developed resistance to currently available RAF kinase inhibitors such as Vemurafenib and dabrafenib and have the potential to offer new treatment options for melanoma and other cancer.</p>
<p>We are developing this compound in collaboration with consortiums of well known U.K. Oncology Research Institution. David will now provide you with information on our commercial activities.</p>
<p><strong>David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Achim. We recently launched our antibiotic Zevtera, ceftobiprole in three major European markets, France, Italy and the United Kingdom in addition to Germany. A launch is planned in Spain at the end of 2015 or the start of 2016.</p>
<p>To maximise the commercial potential of Zevtera, we also plan to launch an additional countries in collaboration with other distributors or licensed partners. These additional territories typically make use of the European regulatory approval package for their own regulatory submissions. And we are currently in discussions with potential partners for areas such as Central and South America, Asia, Middle East and additional European countries.</p>
<p>Zevtera as a single agent has a broad spectrum of bactericidal activity against both Gram-positive including MRSA and Gram-negative bacteria. It has been shown as a single agent to be as effective in the treatment of hospital acquired pneumonia, as a standard combination treatment with linezolid and ceftaroline.</p>
<p>Treatment failure rates in pneumonia caused by MSRA are still high and that Zevtera addresses an important unmet medical need for these patients. Zevtera has the potential to reduce time in the intensive care unit and the total hospital stay by three and two days respectively. This is a potentially important health economic benefit for hospitals and payers [ph]. Additionally the ceftobiprole [ph] side effect profile is very well accepted by clinicians so taken together Zevtera offers physicians an effective empheric antibiotic treatment option for pneumonia patients.</p>
<p>The focus today in the launched markets has been to gain market access. This involves the market such as Italy and France gaining regional access prior to the individual hospitals ordering the product. However, in addition with antibiotics individual hospitals also often carry out susceptibility test in of the antibiotic against the pathogens in their hospitals, as the pathogen resistance can vary greatly from one hospital to another. This takes some time and explains in part why the introduction of new antibiotic is a gradual process as market access continues.</p>
<p>Whilst we are focused on the market entry of antibiotics Zevtera, we are also very actively preparing for potential launch of isavuconazole which will have the brand name of CRESEMBA in Europe early next year. We&rsquo;re in the process of finalizing country market access dossiers supporting price reimbursement discussions that will be submitted once we have the centralized European marketing authorization.</p>
<p>Isavuconazole is clearly positioned in the area of highest unmet medical need. The invasive mode infections of aspergillosis and mucormycosis. Our organization is currently developing key opinion leader efficacy in our core markets. The upcoming trends in medical mycology conference or TIM [ph] early October will be the next key event for us to interophase with these key opinion leaders.</p>
<p>With the launch of Zevtera, we have established a dedicated country commercial structure that was built to focus on those hospitals that have described both [Indiscernible]. The countries field placed roles include sales account managers, medical and market access personnel. CRESEMBA and Zevtera have potentially a large overlapping hospital target audience such as ID Physicians, Microbiologists, ICU Physicians and hematologists, oncologist. These leads to a significant commercials synergy with all the field based country &ndash; are able to work across both brands.</p>
<p>I will now hand over to Donato, who will update you on our financial highlights for the first half of the year and provide financial guidance for the full year 2015. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Donato Spota</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, David. All the figures I will refer to are on Swiss francs unless indicated otherwise. Contract revenue in the first six months of 2015 amounted to CHF 24.4 million compared to CHF 20.2 million for the first half of 2014. This includes CHF 18.8 million related to the global agreement with Stiefel for Toctino and CHF 5.6 million related to the license agreement with Astellas for isavuconazole.</p>
<p>Total revenue in the first half year 2015 amounted to CHF 25 million including sales, compared to CHF 20.3 million for the respective period in 2014. Basilea continues to make focused investments in its key value driving assets. We invested CHF 31.2 million in our research and development activities compared to CHF 27.5 million in the first half year 2014.</p>
<p>SG&amp;A expenses amounted to CHF 23.8 million compared to CHF 12.3 million in the first six months of 2014. This increase is primarily due to the commercialization of ceftobiprole in Germany, France, U.K. and Italy and activities to prepare and to support the potential launch of isavuconazole in major European countries.</p>
<p>In the first half year of 2015, the operating loss amounted to CHF 30 million, compared to CHF 19.5 million in the first six months of 2014. This change is mainly due to high operating expenses related to commercial activities for ceftobiprole and pre launch activities for isavuconazole as well as higher investments in our oncology pipeline.</p>
<p>The net loss amounted to CHF 30.1 million compared to CHF 19.4 million in the respective 2014 period. The basic and diluted loss per share for the first six months of 2015 amounted to CHF 3 compared to CHF 1.97 for the first six months of 2014.</p>
<p>The net cash used for operating activities in the first half year 2015 amounted to CHF 19.3 million compared to CHF 44.9 million in the first half year 2014. This decrease is mainly due to the milestone payment of CHF 30.0 million received from Astellas in April this year upon approval of isavuconazole in the U.S.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2015 our combined cash and short-term investments were CHF 218.4 million compared to CHF 226.1 million as of December 31, 2014.</p>
<p>Total operating expenses for 2015 are estimated at approximately CHF 9 million on average per month. Basilea's average operating loss in 2015 is estimated at approximately CHF 4-5 million on average per month.</p>
<p>Basilea remains focused on establishing Zevtera in hospitals in the major European countries in 2015 and to prepare potential launch of isavuconazole in Europe.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Donato. To summarize our goal for the remainder of this year we as a company made focus on the areas of highest medical needs and commercial value in case of treatment of invasive mold infections in invasive aspergillosis and mucormycosis and we expect to receive European Commissions divisions is expected in the next month.</p>
<p>We are finalizing market access dossiers to the [Indiscernible] and we are ready to file leases soon as there is a decision by the Commission on isavuconazole. In the U.S. while the participants are ready &ndash; CRESEMBA sales through royalties and milestones on sales generated by our licensing partners Astellas. We are actively negotiating the traditional agreements for the commercialization of both our brands at CRESEMBA outside of our markets. At the same time we are in discussions with collaborators to able to bring Zevtera to the U.S. market.</p>
<p>This year we anticipate reporting Phase 2a data from solid tumor patients through our tumor checkpoint controller BAL101553. We will discuss these results together with our robust preclinical biomarker data with potential partners. We continue our prudent management of our expenses and our cash as we are now also focusing on building revenue from our products.</p>
<p>We look forward now to answering your questions.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The first question comes from Mr. Bob Pooler from valuationLAB. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon, gentlemen. Congratulations on eventful first half and also exciting second half coming up. Just some questions, I think I'll group them first on the products, first starting on Zevtera.</p>
<p>The first question, could you give the initial feedback from subscribers and from quintiles on initial uptake and subscriptions coming from that? And then the second question here is on average how long does it take for the hospitals to put Zevtera on their treatment list. And then, third and funny question on Zevtera, as you mentioned U.S. discussions on ongoing with partners -- with the FDA, what we expect from that?</p>
<p>In particular now also with the QIDP grants, and also that includes skin effects, so-- also into skin infections as well for the development program as well as commercialization program.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Bob. On the first two questions, I'll hand over to David to talk to you about the response from prescribers on Zevtera and giving the drug on formulation guidelines and then I'll turn over to Achim to talk about the anticipated meeting with the FDA and what indications will be looking at with them.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>So, its&rsquo; David here. Thanks for the question. I mean the big level, the big picture level, its&rsquo; starts like I said, we are focused largely for the first for the six months of this year so far on market access and in some of the countries regarding just recently launched in Italy, France and the U.K. but in those markets for example Italy and France there is a regional access hurdle to go through where you need go get the regions to approve the drug before individual hospitals will put the drug on the former and use it.</p>
<p>So for example initially we&rsquo;ve had four regions that have approved the drug for &ndash; we haven&rsquo;t rejected the drug yet, but we&rsquo;ve got four regions that have approved the drug and that means in those regions now the focus is on getting to the individual hospitals in those regions to start using the product. And that&rsquo;s &ndash; so the access barrier as we call it in each of them.</p>
<p>And then, in for example the U.K. in Scotland, the Scottish Medicines Consortium had a positive outcome there in July, so again, in Scotland and that could influence the rest of the U.K. you can start we expect to start seeing now individual hospitals putting the products of 4 million and the units there.</p>
<p>Again, like I said the focus on market access very much at the moment. In terms of the feedback from clinicians as to what they think about the product, we&rsquo;re positioned in ourselves as an empiric ideal treatment for patients with high particularly with suspected MRSA involvement, and the physicians that some physicians buy into that precisely in line with our physician are the people who rather not use it as an empiric treatment, would rather use it as when they have got confirmed MRSA. So some clinicians, there&rsquo;s a whole spectrum of the individuals sort of clinicians responses from people that accepted as an ideal empiric treatment in places where they currently use are the people we act in terms of they wanted to see confirmed MRSA because of our effectiveness against MRSA and then in terms of &ndash; they are probably the two &ndash; may comes.</p>
<p>In terms of, no one seems to have a problem with our price, we have no objections about price, about the safety profile, so it&rsquo;s more the questions we get into the more detailed discussions and more around the patient, the exact patient type and whether its&rsquo; an empiric patient or whether it&rsquo;s a confirmed pathogen patient. They are probably the biggest areas of feedback that I could probably send now. Maybe I&rsquo;ll hand over the part to Achim.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Achim Kaufhold</strong></p>
<p>Yes sure, thanks David. With regards to the discussions with the FDA we actually like to discuss with the FDA protocols for two indications for which we just got QIDP indication in the skin study and cut study and from previous conversations with the FDA we know that the FDA would support then those indications, skin and cut based on two studies in one in cut and one in skin that would be mutually supportive to gain these two indications.</p>
<p>In addition we are open -- we would like to open a discussion with the FDA about bacteremia study and for there have not been too many previous studies done in bacteremia and here we are seeking FDA advice on the contact and the design and contract of such study.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>And those discussions won&rsquo;t you expect in the next meeting time wise?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Achim Kaufhold</strong></p>
<p>In the second half of this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And maybe just on discussions also maybe around on the partnering discussions especially now with this collocation also skin infections included those which trigger more and more interest also with more of the pharma companies actually interest are going back into [Indiscernible] factors.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>We have considered in the programs. We have very good data, pre clinical data, annual data on for example in the [Indiscernible] which we are looking at but there are very few options for patients there -- factoring and so we are in active discussions now and negotiations to be able to bring that forward and I hope to have something this year that we can be able to communicate on that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. If I may then I&rsquo;ll move on to CRESEMBA then, just also there may be the initial U.S. no feedback there on sales and so I don&rsquo;t know and how far you had our feedbacks up from new partner Astellas and to the formularies.</p>
<p>Just also there maybe the initial U.S., no feedback there in sales and so I don't know and how far you had -- just feedback from your partner Astellas and positioning the formularies.</p>
<p>Yes. Then second would be the positioning of course is the oral set down, that's still relatively new because the active three trials were just announced recently. But what do you see there a chance off label use in the U.S. And would this also has an impact on the Astellas milestone and royalty?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>I'll comment on -- great David here. I'll comment on the first part of your question. Obviously we have a joint steering committee between us and Astellas so we communicate regularly with regard to for example, commercialization.</p>
<p>And so, all I can say really is that in terms of Astella's performance since the end of April when they launched CRESEMBA in the U.S., it's in line with their expectations and in terms of elements like the former successes, accounts ordering, account, et cetera in line with our expectations.</p>
<p>So, that's what I can say, that I can quote status figures more -- it's in line with expectations and so we will stay enough for both pleased and we share the learnings by the way obviously within our joint commercialization committee, so that we for the European launch, we pick up any learnings from that U.S. launch.</p>
<p>In terms of the Candida point, maybe I hand back to Achim, but clearly both in the U.S. and Europe, it's out of label, we have no bit of inch to promote, promotionally in the U.S. and Europe in the Candida area, so that's clear in both jurisdiction.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Achim Kaufhold</strong></p>
<p>Bob, your question was regard to the over step down options we just started to discuss, that let us to see to see whether there are any bases there on which would look for new indications, second step would tend to discuss with the regulators, whether they would take accept our data. And the third option that is -- and this is parallel what if we engage thought leader so we have -- to look for application strategy and see whether they would endorse the inclusion of isavuconazole or until all step down option in treatment guidelines.</p>
<p>And that's coming also I guess with prepare to [indiscernible] where you might see some off label used there too, because physicians will look at the drugs approved and then for mold infections -- actually, a step down therapy which is still very effective and also has a different profile in tolerability and so, there I think could be some off label use, which of course you cannot actively promote.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>Sure, I mean all your points, I want to take. And I think, either from over stepped down option, I though you intern turn to the good safety profile and -- but in addition, so that would position us very well -- fully commerce dollars and then they are also increasing the Candida strength that are resistant to isavuconazole and here isavuconazole has excellent in-vitro activity, what will be the two points we would focus our discussions.</p>
<p>Okay. And just any impact on the Astellas milestone and royalty, this probably in our Phase 1 approval or not?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Donato Spota</strong></p>
<p>This is the Donato speaking, hi Bob.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>Hi Don.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Donato Spota</strong></p>
<p>We received 30 million this year on approval, the U.S. approval. And we are receiving going forward, we'll receive royalties on the sale that Astellas had in the U.S. And we have up to 219 million in sales milestones, left.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>And then just if I may, two more questions. One just on Toctino, the status there and when do you expect to potentially have the U.S. launch? And just to check again is the 40 million of milestone is not declining.</p>
<p>And then the final question from my side is cash of 280 million that begs the question of course of what you want to do with that acquisitions, development or commercialization partners and you have a preference for anti-infectives or oncology products.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>Hi. This is Ron speaking. I'm just going to go first to your question about cash. We're -- I just will -- think we're very focused with how we invest our money and we are not doing it -- we're not planning any acquisitions, you've seen that we've added to our portfolio leverage and then we continue to look at that into areas that we can or are able to be able to enter into a collaboration that within our budget also -- within our financial means.</p>
<p>On oncology versus anti-infectives, we're in a considerable distance; we're focused on both areas. I would say there are a lot more opportunities in oncology than there are in anti-infectives. There are not that many companies that are active in fact, few companies that are active in the anti-infectives.</p>
<p>So, they are not that many opportunities in rental business, interested in opportunities if we could find then. There are more opportunities in oncology, but they are -- they become very expensive. So, we have to look at collaborations that we can participate in within that.</p>
<p>So, we're very careful with our money, we're using that as wisely to be able to bring our focus compounds to bring market and also, I mean, you saw that we have some increase in spending related to commercializing Zevtera and bringing in preparing for a launch with CRESEMBA, which is taking some of financial resources to do that, so that we can generate more income and move to profitability.</p>
<p>So, that's currently what we're focusing. And you see that the increase in our spending was related to the commercial activities CRESEMBA plus the materials that we need for launch that we have to -- that having to take some time to produce those. You had another question about 40 million, what was that about?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Just sort of waiting for Toctino with -- on the U.S. plans and if that's included in the guidance or not?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>It's not included in the guidance. That's an upside, but -- the last that we've not included in the GSK that they are planning to file the drug in United States is the last information we have this year and the 40 million is still what's in the contract. So, if they get the drug approved in the United States than we -- there would be milestone.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bob Pooler</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks for answering all the questions gentlemen.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Thanks Bob.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Mr. Olav Zilian from Helvea-Baader. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking my questions. So, I would actually have maybe three of them. To start with, for David, the expectations on the sales performance of Zevtera, you have currently compared with your expectations earlier this year, have they changed?</p>
<p>And then to Achim, it would be about some details concerning the ongoing Phase 2a program on the oncology compound, BAL101553, you indicated that you consider further development in 12 months, what about other two medications?</p>
<p>And the third question would be also one for Achim about hospital-acquired pneumonia; specifically you have discussed that with FDA, of course, FDA's view on that potential entire program here?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>Yes, So, David, just in terms of the sales expectations what we said from day one was that it would be a gradual sort of sales increase and as is often seen with antibiotics because something just to build on a previous comment I may, you got these -- this is the year of gaining access. So, in the four big markets that we've launched in, three of them just very recently, we've gotten through this, like I said, national, regional, local access.</p>
<p>So -- and that's common to, I guess, all areas, the thing that makes antibiotics even more, somewhat gradual at the beginning, because you have susceptibility testing phase, so many hospitals want -- and we give them the provision to do that, by providing them with testing strips.</p>
<p>So, there are currently many hospitals in all these major markets are currently testing, so we've got the market access hurdles, we've got the testing, so that makes antibiotics. And if you look at previous launches of antibiotics, global launches, clearly European antibiotic launches your budgets launches are for example, different than U.S. antibiotic launches and they are more gradual to start.</p>
<p>So, in terms of how does it meeting with our expectations, we thought it would be gradual to start and what we expect to see in the second half of this year, hit the sales to stop picking up and then more significant sales in 2016.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Achim Kaufhold</strong></p>
<p>And Olav I'll address your questions, so the first was regarding glioblastoma, yes, we have, I mean this is driven by a high unmet medical need for this type of brain cancer. And second also by the properties of our compound which shows good brain penetration as well as good data, animal data in this tumor type. So, we are in discussions with potential partner to develop this compound in this indication.</p>
<p>With regards to the ongoing studies in other tumor types, I think here we just have to wait for data, we are investigating the drug in other tumor types and we must make sure that we get enough patients per tumor type, such as ovarian cancer, triple-negative breast cancer and so forth to make any decision on which tumor type to further focus on the Phase 2b study.</p>
<p>And I think your last question was respect to hospital-acquired pneumonia development in the United States. I think, so that the current focus is clearly on skin and copper, everybody would have the next discussion, but also bacterial has indicated we have very strong animal data and endocarditis, so there is a compelling case to pursue the drug in Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia and these been in our potential next step.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, maybe as a follow-up to David, if I properly interpret the financial guidance, it has changed a bit for the operating loss. So, before I would assume you would expect it higher revenues, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Donato Spota</strong></p>
<p>Olav, this is Donato speaking, if I may take that. Well, the reason why we have adjusted the guidance is mainly an expense-driven. We have had some as Ron indicated, we're investing and also preparing to launch of isavuconazole through the supply chain, we had an extra expense which related debt and then also some one-off expenses a with regard to license agreement at the end -- manufacturing, IT and know-how and also with regard to expanding our oncology portfolio. So, that's the main driver there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Mr. Fabian Wenner from Kepler Cheuvreux. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Fabian Wenner</strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon gentlemen. Just three quick questions, the first one, again on Zevtera and it's really just a follow up. I appreciate that the sales ramp takes a lot of time and I think you said -- Ron said two years ago when Zevtera was approved that we would not see any earnings impact until like 2015. Now we have 2015 and I just want to recap that you do expect some sales in the second half? Are you willing to give a rough number and also for 2016 I think that would be appreciated.</p>
<p>Then secondly with regard to your guidance for 2017 breakeven, wanted to understand whether candidemia disappointment has push that out a little bit, or more specifically what kind of sales level you expect from CRESEMBA and Zevtera in Europe that you need to get to breakeven that also would be helpful, that's all will be actually be the last question I think this regards to Toctino has been answered. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>Its David here, I'll let maybe answer one, two across breakeven element of the answer. In terms of isavuconazole and the candidemia part, we thought always all along that the majority -- the biggest unmet medical need and the biggest sales potential from the mold to aspergillosis and mucormycosis rather than candidemia.</p>
<p>As we discussed on our previous question, we may well get some off-label to step down use anyway in that area -- anyway as Achim said, as we discussed with KOLs and regulatory authorities and understand the data better, maybe in the years to come, those indications as of now, we're actually forecast we'll build on the aspergillosis and the mucormycosis being biggest areas of the medical need and so that's just one thing to say.</p>
<p>In terms of, like I said partly onto your first question which was the, do we expect sales to increase in second half of the year. Like I said, the first half of this year has definitely been all around access, the second half of the year, clearly there will also be -- there is more access work to do, but we expect a significant increase in sales in the second part of this year versus the first part and then a significant increase in first half in 2016.</p>
<p>I mean that's clearly of a low base like you'd expect when you start launching a product. But we clearly expect this increase to happen after the access year 2015. I don't think we've given; we're not going to give guidance now on sales numbers for 2015 and 2016. But maybe I'll hand over to Donato or Ron to talk about the breakeven part of your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Donato Spota</strong></p>
<p>So, with regards to the breakeven question that you had probably on -- this is Donato speaking. And so -- not have an effect on the breakeven. Although various factors which right -- we talked about commercial partnerships, so it depends on -- on quickly we can enter into these partnerships and have the infrastructure and that on one hand.</p>
<p>On the other hand side, also with regards to our early-stage clinical activities also there it depend on and how we partner, when we partner and what -- participate in the partnerships. So, there are number of factors, which influenced why where those breakeven. But you mentioned 2017. So from our-- on the view-- based on the view, 2017 could still be feasible.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>So maybe I misunderstand you. But you were talking partnerships as a prerequisite to achieving a breakeven, that can't be right. I mean you're -- obviously your guidance previously was for breakeven 2017 without additional partnerships, but just based on CRESEMBA and Zevtera. So, I'm just curious whether you can share with us your internal budgeting and how much sales you would need to achieve that and that the target.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Donato Spota</strong></p>
<p>Fabian I think with regard to partnerships, I mean -- we've always communicated that in terms of commercialization. We are focusing on the core European market and then expand to the commercial ramp by entering into partnership out in our results side -- outside the reviewed markets, so I think this has not changed.</p>
<p>So, I think this has not changed, and obviously I think to reduce to full potential of these sales -- of isavuconazole and Zevtera, we want to go out and beyond the key five European markets. So, I think this has not changed with regard to what we have been communicating before.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>And this is Ron, I would also say that related to, for example, our oncology program, I think we have consistently communicated that we will look for partners there and this has an impact on us, because the cost of going further as you know the cost going further into development, those cost increase.</p>
<p>And so this is why we've been very active in talking to potential partners about our -- program, it also makes and we've communicated, it makes the most sensitive partnerships there to be able to go forward with multiple tumor types. We are already in discussions with often indicated related to glioblastoma and potential collaboration there.</p>
<p>And something like that we can do our self, but I think to get the full value of our culti [ph] program. We need to be able to go ahead and partner that further gives, we do not have sufficient funds to do multiple tumor type -- we can't do that, we don't have money to do that.</p>
<p>So, this is always been our plan and is not related to some type of one-off milestone signature stopping that we need for profitability. It's just a question of ongoing development cost and this is always been a part of our planning to be able to average the patient, where the expense is going forward. So, that is a part of our planning although it does not include any type of -- our planning does not include any type of large one-off payments, but it does includes being able to shift over time, the development cost and share those with other third-party.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. Just to make sure, I understand, you're not going further into Phase 3 or other trials in oncology until you have a partner, that's correct still?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. That means also that -- in order to achieve your old 2017 target breakeven, that doesn't-- partners, additional partners. That is just really to fund a separate program that is underway, which you wouldn't -- which you won't really pursue if you don't find a partner?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>It's not an old goal, it's the same goal. So, the same objective we have is to have breakeven in 2015, that hasn't changed. And related -- what we communicated that we would do the Phase 2a trial, which we're doing right now. And when we have the data from the Phase 2a, we will be sharing that additional information with potential partners.</p>
<p>And so that we could have additional funding for the Phase 2b. Now whether we go ahead and partner and I don't think we've talked about it too -- at that point, depends on the offers we get. But we're always and have always been open to collaborations and to doing financial transactions that help us to create more value for our shareholders.</p>
<p>And so we are always open to that that is how we hit-- with the collaboration with Astellas on isavuconazole and also our transactions with Toctino. So, we're always in discussions to share information with potential partners and as we go forward, if we have a good deal, then we're planning to be able to share that development cost going forward on our cancer programs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Ivona Danojlovic from Alpha Deal Group. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ivona Danojlovic </p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>What are the major risks at European sales that you would highlight?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>So the question was the major risks to the sales?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ivona Danojlovic </p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>European sales, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>Okay. I mean the major risk to the sales are probably around the area, like I said, I touched on a moment ago, the feedback you get from customers is that they like to the profile of the product, but, and you see lots of press coverage around the global issue resistance account antibiotics and new antibiotics needed. So we've introduced a new effective agent as I described earlier.</p>
<p>And there's also this concept of antimicrobial stewardship which exists in Europe and in some markets more than markets, which is around with new antibiotics that are effective, reserving them a bit more than -- become will routine. So, I think the biggest threat to the business is also risk to the sales to answer question is probably just this concept of antimicrobial stewardship and the keep in an effective new agent back and not becoming so routine in use could change the sort of the market share progression of the drug.</p>
<p>So, the sales line could be steep or it could be less probably, the important thing to bear in mind with regard to Zevtera. Obviously, with regard to CRESEMBA, isavuconazole, it's a different market with different market dynamics and the opportunity, we believe in CRESEMBA significantly bigger than the opportunity with regard to Zevtera. So, that's probably just work for completeness just answering your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Ivona Danojlovic </p>
<p></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>The next question is from Mr. Sameer [indiscernible] from RE Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my question. A straightforward question on pricing, really. Could you just confirm that the pricing in Italy, France, U.K. and Germany is at the same level? And also if you could just talk about whether you've gone through the AMNOG review yet in Germany or not?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>No, we haven't gone through the AMNOG review in Germany. It's a hospital-only product and obviously CRESEMBA ultimately will be in terms of the pricing, the price when you say it, they're at the same level. Basically, what happens is let me show you the benchmark, you have national discussions with pricing and you benchmark in some way with national authorities in terms of the standard treatments that are available and we use largely the argument of the composites from the clinical studies, the pre-clinical studies and therefore, we end up with in part building to the prices of those products in the markets at that time. So, that you end up at a range, it's quite a tight range, but it's roughly between &euro;150 and &euro;200 a day and that's the published prices of these products, Zevtera in this market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Just one follow-up, you mentioned that your partners for Zevtera in the U.S. Have you costed out the program and how much it would -- you would have to pay to complete development in the U.S.?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>This is Ron speaking, yes, we have of course spent roughly it's about $40 million per trial and we're looking at two trials that's somewhere around 80 million, approximately to do the two trials.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. That's great. Thanks Ron.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>You're welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We have a follow-up question from Mr. Olav Zilian. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Yes, thank you for the chance. I would have one concerning the chemical party discussed earlier. So, can we assume that the glioblastoma indication is sufficiently cooperated, i.e. the number of patients fully enrolled and data analyzed or is that part of the study still ongoing?</p>
<p>And then concerning your discussion FDA for the QIDP status, so we have heard of two indications. I would like to know what the divers are in this discussion, so is this the profile of antibiotics or the data package or is this a wish list of your potential partner? Particularly why as the hospital to excise pneumonia indication not to be considered or has that been considered, but the status was not granted?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Achim Kaufhold</strong></p>
<p>Olav, Achim here, with respect to your fist question, the glioblastoma, I would like to clarify that glioblastoma patient are currently not included in our Phase 1 studies, so I was talking about future development pathway of the drug.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay, I understand.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Achim Kaufhold</strong></p>
<p>And with regard to the QIDP designation, I think what you need to provide through the FDA is a compelling data package that justifies each indication and then you have to -- but as QIDP designation as always linked to a certain indication that you can ask for and you can do this subsequently. So, currently, we have asked for the cup and the skin indication that as a next step, we can at any time FDA for the hub indication.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. So in those discussions, you have internally or are there partners involved? Potential partners obviously.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>So, the types of -- yes the types of trials we're looking at, we have been discussing with potential partners.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, coming back to this famous sector A study that is still ongoing. I would like to know if you have the sufficient insight into the biomarker part of that study, so are you satisfied to the data you're looking to file and could you specify that a bit, how this ties ongoing with solid tumor indications could be completed further?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>Olav, the trial is ongoing. I think, we have -- for certain tumor types, we have more patients than for other tumor types. I think we need to have enrolled sufficient tumor types and sufficient patient per tumor type in order to be able to comment further so.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>And across the different tumor types regarding the biomarkers is there any -- at least preliminary conclusions to be made right now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>Well, as I can just comment on what has been published, we have actually one very promising biomarker, which is called BAL1 published data that is certainly one of the promising tumor marker and just commenting on the patients stratification biomarker than we have an addition obviously of pharmacodynamic biomarker. But so far for the stratification biomarker to BAL1, we can certainly share and some of the results that we have published, so we could provide you with the cost for example.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>And BAL1 is that a biomarker, you can rely on based on the commercially available tests.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Veitch</strong></p>
<p>No, there's no commercially available test. That would need to be developed as partial commercial test.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you very much. I sit back.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>I would add we filed -- full host of biomarkers. Achim has just indicated the one that we published thus far, but we have a number of biomarkers that we have tested on and there are co-relating to the different tumor types that we have are investigating into.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Olav Zilian</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Gentlemen that was last question.</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Scott</strong></p>
<p>Great, I'd like to thank you all for participating in our call today. I think that you've heard that we have a very sound basis going forward. We have a drug launched in the United States with the high medical need, our antifungal CRESEMBA.</p>
<p>We're looking forward to the EU decision in the next month, so that we and are preparing for a launch of CRESEMBA, this will be driving profitability as we move towards profitability, in the next year that we have that drug sales towards us with Zevtera.</p>
<p>The two drugs together are very synergistic and we're very excited to be able to potentially bring two drugs -- have two drugs in the market staring next year. We also are quite excited about the profits we're making on our oncology portfolio; hope to be able to share that data with you later this year. So, wish you all a nice weekend and thank you for joining our call. Good bye.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, the conference is now over. Thank you for choosing chorus call and thank you for participating in the conference. You may now disconnect your lines. Good bye.</p>
