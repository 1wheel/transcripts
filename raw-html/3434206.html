And joining me on today's call is Doug Glaspey, our President and Chief Operating Officer, and Kerry Hawkley, our Chief Financial Officer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to ask Kerry to now open us with our Safe Harbor statement. Kerry?</p>
<p><strong>Kerry Hawkley</strong></p>
<p>Before beginning our discussion, we would like to remind you that the information provided during this call may contain forward-looking statements relating to current expectation, estimates, forecasts and projections about future events that are forward-looking as defined in the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.</p>
<p>These forward-looking statements generally relate to the Company's plans, objectives and expectations for future operations and are based on management's current estimates and projections of future results or trends. Actual future results may differ materially from those projected as a result of certain risks and uncertainties.</p>
<p>During the call, we will present non-GAAP financial measures such as EBITDA, adjusted EBITDA, and adjusted net income. Reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures and management's reason for presenting such information is set forth in the press release that was issued last night. Because these measures are not calculated in accordance with U.S. GAAP, it should not be considered in isolation from our financial statements prepared in accordance with GAAP.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Kerry. Before we go any further, I just wanted to share that we are very saddened by the passing of a longtime friend of U.S. Geothermal. John McIlveen with Jacob Securities had covered our Company as an analyst since we first started back in 2003. John was originally with Dundee Securities and later with Jacob Securities. John understood our industry and our business, and always had excellent questions for us. He will surely be missed by us all.</p>
<p>As we reached the mid-year, we are pleased with our performance to-date, in particular, as we noticed in our news release, we&rsquo;ve had steady revenue, net income, and EBITDA. U.S. Geothermal&rsquo;s net income as adjusted is up 329%, we&rsquo;ve had strong operating performance at all of our plants, we&rsquo;ve significantly advanced two of our development projects and our Board of Directors has approved a stock repurchase program and has also undertaken an initiative to examine strategic alternatives for the Company. We&rsquo;ve also reaffirmed and tightened our 2015 guidance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m going to summarize some of the notable highlights for the first six months of 2015. On the financial performance side, on a consolidated basis, for the first six months, our Company revenues were up -- were $14.3 million, our adjusted EBITDA was $7.35 million, our cash flow from operations was $6.8 million and our net income was $1.2 million or $1.5 million before tax consideration. We reduced our total liabilities during this period by $1.9 million with long-term debt reduced by $2 million. We ended the first six months with cash and cash equivalents of $12.8 million.</p>
<p>The financial performance of U.S. Geothermal by itself after eliminating minority interest, which is our partner interest on Neal Hot Springs and Raft River, provided net income as adjusted attributable to U.S. Geothermal for the first six months of $803,000 compared to $187,00 during the prior year. And cash flow to U.S. Geothermal from operations before overhead is approximately $9 million to $10 million per year. On the operating performance side, our fleet wide average operating availability for the first six months is an impressive 98.7%.</p>
<p>We completed our first major overhaul at Raft River after seven years of operation and completed our spring outages at San Emidio and Neal Hot Springs. On the growth side, at El Ceibillo in Guatemala, we received approval of our modified construction schedule under our geothermal concession agreement from the Guatemalan Ministry of Energy and Mines. We have begun drilling our exploration well EC-2 and currently planned to follow that with the drilling of well EC-3. We&rsquo;ve received permits for the next round of drilling in the South Zone at San Emidio and we have begun drilling there.</p>
<p>On our Geysers project, we completed and extended flow test of our production wells which yielded excellent results. The flow test results from those wells were at or above the rates achieved when the wells were originally drilling -- were originally drilled. We have had numerous meetings with counterparties interested in possible power purchase agreements and we&rsquo;ve submitted formal offer proposals as well. On our Neal Hot Springs project, we have begun drilling of our water supply wells to be used for hybrid cooling to increase our summer time generation. The drilling is now complete and we are beginning our flow testing.</p>
<p>We continue the evaluation of a number of other potential acquisitions that could contribute to the growth of our Company both in the near and the long term. And with that, I&rsquo;d like to turn it over to Doug Glaspey, our President and Chief Operating Officer, who will now provide you with highlights of our operations and development activities here during the first six months. Doug?</p>
<p><strong>Doug Glaspey</strong></p>
<p>Thank you Dennis, and welcome everybody. Overall, our generation for the second quarter from all three plants was 72,947 megawatt hours and that compares to 74,384 megawatt hours in the first quarter of 2014, first half excuse me, first quarter. Generation for the first half totaled 168,874 megawatt hours and that is compared to 173,268 megawatt hours during the same period in 2014. That is a 2.5% reduction between the two periods.</p>
<p>We are continuing to see warmer than average temperatures and certainly through the second quarter that all three sites recorded 5 to 6 degrees above average to the period. June, in this part of the world was particularly hot with a range of 8.5 to 11.7 degrees above average depending on the location that [indiscernible] broke in July and we&rsquo;ve returned to our normal temperature patterns. And as noted by Dennis, all three projects conducted their annual maintenance outages during the second quarter.</p>
<p>At Neal Hot Springs, our generation was 37,232 megawatt hours, with the facility averaging 18.6 net megawatts per hour of operation. Neal operated at 97.6% availability for the quarter, excluding the planned annual maintenance hours. And all three units completed their normal annual maintenance outages during the second quarter with nothing extraordinary. We also reached the settlement with our equipment supply contractor Turbine Air Systems during the quarter and five of the key equipment suppliers for the project. That settlement provided a cash payment to the project company USG Oregon LLC and a commitment from those five suppliers to repair specific equipment deficiencies and provide extended warranties for that equipment.</p>
<p>At San Emidio, our generation for the quarter was 18,492 megawatt hours. And we averaged 9.2 net megawatts per hour at San Emidio. We operated at 97.6% availability for the quarter, identical to Neal, also a good quarter. At Raft River, we generated 17,223 megawatt hours during the second quarter and we averaged 9.2 net megawatts per hour. Raft River operated at 99.97% availability during the quarter, again, excluding our extended maintenance outage hours. I will note that starting with indications for June and July, and consulted with a vibration expert and the company that rebuild the turbines and it was determined that the new bearings were failing, so the plant was shut down on August 2, current schedule will have the plant back up and running by August 16.</p>
<p>Overall, we are very pleased with the performance of all three plants during the first half of the year, and our operations team continues to produce outstanding operational availability at all facilities and that of course contributes to our high-level of power generation. On the development front at the WGP Geysers project, our focus for development is now primarily on securing a Power Purchase Agreement, building a new power plant and selling electricity. A steam sale is still possible for this project and we can always consider that up to the point we sign a PPA. Recent meetings with potential power purchases have been very positive. At California Utility&rsquo;s Public Utility districts and a new class of power purchases in the state called community aggregators are faced with finding new renewable power sources in the State of California that moves towards the 50% renewable portfolio standard, I think that&rsquo;s the highest in the nation.</p>
<p>Additionally California has committed to drastically reduce carbon emissions from all carbon sources in the state. These potential buyers shedding fossil fuel generation, must recall, from their portfolios, and they are looking for clean energy sources inside California to replace them. A new base load renewable power project like ours at the Geysers gets very high marks on both fronts.</p>
<p>Solar and wind reports are very popular, but they can&rsquo;t produce power around the clock. An existing geothermal resources in the state can only maintain the status quo and can&rsquo;t contribute to the goal set by the governor to reduce carbon emissions.</p>
<p>We completed an extended flow test program at the Geysers in June on the three production wells that has the highest steam flow rates than our neighbor drills in 2008, 2009. All three wells produced steam at estimated flow rate at or above the previous results, confirming the wells are open and available for immediate production. To protect the production casing in these wells from any corrosion we do keep them under nitrogen blanket during idle periods. All of the test data has been delivered to GeothermEx, our consultant reservoir engineer and we expect to have their reservoir report in late August or early September.</p>
<p>Engineering studies are also continuing to move the design of the hybrid cooling system for the power plant forward. Our transmission interconnection application with the California Independent System Operator was accepted. It was accepted into the Independent Study Process in late May and that&rsquo;s a very important step for us because it actually reduces the time that takes together an interconnection agreement by a year to year-and-half. The application for a new conditional use permit, which is required before construction can start was submitted to Sonoma County in June.</p>
<p>[indiscernible] and as has been mentioned, our modified development schedule that has been pending was signed by the Minister of Energy on July 21. With the new schedule approval we immediately asked our driller to mobilize this equipment to the site and we have begun drilling well EC2 on August 6.</p>
<p>EC2 is designed to test high temperature anomaly and it was defined by nine-hole temperature gradient drilling program we completed in early 2014. The EC2 is planned for a depth of 2,000 feet or 600 meters. It&rsquo;s target area is particularly interesting because it has very high measured temperatures, up to 412 degrees Fahrenheit, that&rsquo;s 211 degrees Centigrade at only 655 feet deep, which indicates the presence of the very hot and active resource. We are also pointing to the drill well EC2, which will test a shallow loss circulation zone we founded about 600 feet deep during the PG program. That zone had a major temperature of 379 degrees Fahrenheit or 193 degree C.</p>
<p>Now that we have a schedule that allows us time to develop the project, we will re-establish our discussions with the energy broker, we previously had our Memorandum of Understanding months for PPA as well as contacting other potential purchases, both in Guatemala and then joining Central American countries with these dependable base load energy.</p>
<p>At San Emidio Phase 2, in early May, we received drilling permits from the Bureau of Land Management for five temperature gradient wells. These are all located in the south zone, farther south than where we&rsquo;ve drilled in the past. Our high temperature trend, which has been defined by observation wells drilling in 2014 combined with geophysics and historical temperature gradient data continues to develop a new target area on the southern end of our leases. Due to this area having very little past surface disturbance, the drilling program was designed with no road or drill path construction to accelerate that approval from the BLM and to provide low environmental impact. Our drilling operations commenced on July 24 and two of the first three wells have been completed. We will probably complete the third well today. Initial temperature measurements on these wells are encouraging with high gradients that are indicative of an active geothermal system at depth.</p>
<p>Data from these wells &ndash; say first three wells will determine what part of the remaining holes will be drilled in and what their locations will be. Depending on final results, we will either permit additional temperature gradient wells or we have the option to deepen the existing temperature gradient wells to test the most prospective temperatures.</p>
<p>At Neal Hot Springs, our first water supply well that could have been used for proposed hybrid cooling was completed in June and while it successfully found water, a short flow test indicated that it communicates directly with the small stream nearby, so we can&rsquo;t produce that well under Oregon laws, we just can&rsquo;t impact surface water.</p>
<p>Our second well is drilled in a different location, which again found water and is currently undergoing initial flow test. A long-term flow test will be needed to determine of the aquifer and provide enough water to support the installation of a water cooling system for the facility. In parallel, we have an engineering study that&rsquo;s being led by power engineers to select the most cost effective hybrid system for the project. There are multiple systems. The ability to use water cooling primarily during the five to six months of summer and fall would increase power generation as we noted before on our current air cooling results and a significant reduction in plant output. Our target is to increase the annual average generation of the plant from the design rate of 22 megawatts up to a PPA contract limits of 25 annual average megawatts.</p>
<p>To summarize, we are very focused on advancing our projects and will keep you informed as we go forward. It&rsquo;s exciting to have drills turning again and to see these projects move ahead.</p>
<p>Kerry Hawkley, our CFO will now provide you with a summary of our financial results.</p>
<p><strong>Kerry Hawkley</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Doug and good morning to our listeners on the call. I will now discuss the financial statements of U.S. Geothermal for the six months ended June 30, 2015. You will note that the company is now filing our financial statements and MD&amp;A in a convinced format, which should be read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and 10-K filings for the year ended December 31, 2014.</p>
<p>On our balance sheet, our total assets are $230.8 million. Our total liabilities are 100.1 million. Our non-controlling interests are 45.0 million, and our net stockholders equity is now $85.7 million. We would like to highlight that on our assets, we have cash and cash equivalents of 12.8 million. We also have restricted cash and bond reserves of 22.0 million. So our total cash assets are $34.8 million.</p>
<p>Our statement of operations, revenues for the first six months were 14.3 million, which is consistent with 2014. Our plant production expenses were 4.8 million, down 95,000 over the same period in 2014.</p>
<p>On a consolidated basis, gross profits for Neal Hot Springs were down 229,000. Gross profits for San Emidio are up 601,000 and gross profits for Raft River are down 248,000. Our corporate salaries and wages and stock-based compensation costs were down 217,000, primarily due to the costs allocable to our development projects.</p>
<p>U.S. Geothermal no longer has a tax valuation allowance as existed in 2014 due to a recording of a deferred tax asset in December of 2014. So we recognized income tax expense of 303,000 for GAAP purposes in 2015 and have reduced deferred tax assets by the same amount.</p>
<p>Please note that U.S. Geothermal has no tax liability until the deferred tax asset is totally depleted. The income tax amounts represent tax on U.S. Geothermal&rsquo;s share of net income only.</p>
<p>Six months net income of $1.2 million in 2015, by eliminating the income tax would give you an adjusted net income of $1.5 million in 2015. This compares to $1.2 million for the same period last year. Our net income attributable to non-controlling interests were down 337,000 in 2015 due to lower revenues at Neal Hot Springs and increased payroll and maintenance costs at Raft River.</p>
<p>Net income attributable to U.S. Geothermal was 500,000 in 2015 compared to 187,000 in 2014. Earnings at San Emidio increased 374,000 net of tax in 2015 compared to 2014 due to increased plant revenues and decreased maintenance costs. This is great news for us that San Emidio was 100% owned by U.S. Geothermal.</p>
<p>For comparison purposes, if we had not recorded the deferred tax asset in December 2014, net income attributable to U.S. Geothermal as adjusted would have been $803,000 in 2015 compared to $187,000 in 2014.</p>
<p>On our statement of cash flows, we began the year with cash and cash equivalents of $13.0 million. Six months cash generated by operations was $6.8 million. Note payments reduced our total debt by $2 million. Consolidated debt currently is $96.7 million. U.S. Geothermal&rsquo;s portion of that debt is $70.6 million at June 30. Payments to non-controlling interests were $2.1 million. Capitalized cost at WGP Geysers, San Emidio, El Ceibillo and Crescent Valley totaled $2.9 million. We ended the quarter with cash and cash equivalents of $12.8 million.</p>
<p>On our statement of -- our changes in stockholders equity, we've added net income attributable to U.S. Geothermal of $500,000 during the first six months. Our accumulated deficit net of tax is now $18.8 million. Shares of common stock issued upon exercise of stock options were $145,000 for the first six months, another $428,000 shares were issued with one year hold description. And again cash of $2.1 million was distributed to over non-controlling interest.</p>
<p>Shares of common stock issued and outstanding at June 30 totaled 107.6 million shares. We have continued our disclosure in the MD&amp;A regarding the net income attributable to the non-controlling interest and then resulting net income attributable to U.S. Geothermal and its shareholders. For the first six months, you will see that Neal Hot Springs contributed $1.5 million. San Emidio contributed $512,000. Raft River contributed $87,000 for a total contribution to U.S. Geothermal of $2.1 million. From that, exploration cost activities and corporate overhead cost $1.6 million. All of these figures are net of tax.</p>
<p>Costs in this last category are 100% US Geothermal cost and reduce the net income attributable to U.S. Geothermal. As we continue to grow the company by adding new income generating projects in the future, this last category will not increase significantly from current levels allowing the net income from the new projects to increase the bottom line of U.S. Geothermal almost dollar for dollar.</p>
<p>I would like to thank you for your continued interest in U.S. Geothermal and I will turn the call back over to Dennis.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Kerry. First, I want to comment on our guidance for 2015. Our guidance is based solely on our existing operations and does not include any projection of revenue that may be provided by any acquisitions that you are considering. These figures are a forecast-only and are considered forward-looking statements.</p>
<p>For our remaining guidance for 2015, we&rsquo;ve tightened up our figures. Our revenues, we are now forecasting $29 million to $33 million, our adjusted EBITDA we are forecasting $16 million to $19 million, our EBITDA we are forecasting $14 million to $17 million and net income of $3 million to $6 million.</p>
<p>Our cash position continues to be solid with strong cash flows from operations to U.S. Geothermal after minority interests of $9 million to $10 million per year projected. We continue to have adequate cash on hand to support both our ongoing operation and our early stage development effort and we continue to add cash to our balance sheet in preparation for our next construction project or acquisition.</p>
<p>This week we announced that our board of directors has authorized up to $2 million for share buyback. In addition, a special committee of the board has been formed and has engaged Marathon Capital to act as its financial advisor to evaluate opportunities and to potentially unlock value of the company for the shareholders.</p>
<p>We do wish to point out that U.S. Geothermal is profitable and is performing well. Our power plants and our associated reservoirs are performing well. Our development projects are moving forward with active drilling on three sites. Our primary focus continues to be on accelerating our growth platform. However, our current company valuation and our operating assets alone is below that of recent assets sales seen in the market.</p>
<p>We have received interest from third-parties in acquiring our company, but not at levels that the board feels recognizes our intrinsic value. Given our current market cap and cash position, the board is exercising its fiduciary responsibility to examine all methods of realizing and maximizing shareholder value. We are just beginning this process this week of identifying and unlocking that value. We anticipate that that process will take at least six months.</p>
<p>In closing, we&rsquo;ve now had 11 consecutive quarters of positive EBITDA and cash flow. Our fleet of power plants continues to perform well. We are pleased with the performance of our resources. We are focused on advancing the development projects and working to obtain the necessary power purchase agreements to support those products. The market for renewable energy continues to be strong and Geothermal's competitive advantage of delivering reliable base load power serves us well. We are excited and optimistic about our future growth and we thank you all for your continuing support.</p>
<p>And, operator, with that I would like to turn the call open for Questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Gilles. [Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Jim McIlree with Chardan Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim McIlree</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And I guess it&rsquo;s good morning there. Can you talk a little bit about any potential veto powers or influence Enbridge or Goldman would have on a potential sale of the company?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>On a sale of specific assets, they do have a say. On a sale of the company at the higher level, that's not the case.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim McIlree</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And I am assuming that the special committee is looking at all possibilities to unlock value, is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>That's correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim McIlree</strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. And it was such a clean quarter that there is really not a lot to ask about, so I'm going to ask something really minor. It looked like in the Q, the Geysers project expected commercial date has slipped from Q2 &lsquo;17 to Q3. Is that just a formal kind of slippage, is there anything extra going on there that we should be aware of?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>No, our forecast for Geysers in for full disclosure, Jim, our forecast for Geysers would be that it would come online sometime between the summer of 2017 and summer of 2018. And what will drive that is really two things. One of them is the CAISO interconnection agreement. As Doug had noted earlier, we moved from the, what&rsquo;s called the cluster process to the individual process and under the individual process, because the project previously had an interconnection agreement, we could see an accelerated processing of our application and one that would support that earlier date of summer of 2017.</p>
<p>However, under a normal time table, if we were a new project the time that CAISO could take would support a project COD as late as summer of 2018. The other thing that&rsquo;s going to come into factor is the off-taker that we end up reaching agreement with, what their specific needs are going to be on when they want power deliveries to begin. So, both of those would be key factors in that COD date.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jim McIlree</strong></p>
<p>Okay, fantastic. That is very helpful. And thank you and keep up the good work.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Jim. Always appreciate your questions.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] Our next question comes from the line of Steve Motika, [ph] private investor. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Hi, this is Stephen Motika. I had a question on your advisors and the 30% tax credit. Is that -- if you try to build the project right now, what&rsquo;s the cost of moving, $150 million?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>No, let&rsquo;s say in that neighborhood.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. That would be the gross cost, so 30% of that would be a $45 million cash credit correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>No, in the case of Geysers, no. Geysers is a little unique. In the case of a typical project, the past year going down is correct. Okay. And I can expand on that a little bit if you would like.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, well how much --</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>In the case of Geysers, we bought the project for $6 million but we bought the corporate entity that has been developing the project and they had already invested $96 million into the project. Of that $90 million, roughly $70 million is eligible for inclusion in the capital costs that is eligible for 30% investment tax credit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then would you add that cost for building a plant?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>So, having said that, let&rsquo;s say from this point forward, using your $150 million, I think we show $160 million in our cue, but let&rsquo;s say using the $150 million, just for ease of numbers, if that cost us $150 million to complete the project from this point forward, we would add to that the $70 million of eligible basis that already exist on the asset, so, $220 million would be the total eligible basis for the project for the tax credit. So, 30% of that $220 million is what we believe would be eligible to be monetized.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. You would get $66 million tax credit?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>And then, what did you do, have you sold that to someone else for like 10% or 20% discount?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s in a sense how it works. What you do is you bring in a tax partner into the project. They end up staying into the project in the early period of the project. They realize both that and they realize the accelerated depreciation the makers that&rsquo;s available on the project and they monetize both of those at the time they come into the project.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>So, actually since the cost for U.S. Geothermal [indiscernible] need that much right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s correct, because you have to figure also on that total value we&rsquo;re able to go out and raise debt. So, we don&rsquo;t believe for Geysers, in particular, and we&rsquo;re going to be putting a slide in our next presentation for Geysers, but in the case of Geysers, the capital that we would have to come up with -- or the equity that we would have to come up with is extremely small.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Right. And then you would give a percentage of the profit, but where will you keep it up?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Our intent is to keep the entire project.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>All right. That&rsquo;s sounds good. Hope you get a PPA for it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>And one more question. I mean, we certainly [indiscernible] that you&rsquo;re trying to free up, what is the process on getting that freed up?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>The cash was put into place on the respective projects because the Company was relatively new and the project themselves did not have any operating history to the -- to lean on. So, our ability to go out and secure a letter of credit for those obligations didn&rsquo;t exist. We believe that it may be possible now with two years of strong performance under our belt. And the project is operating at or better than plan to go out and possibly secure a letter of credit for both our San Emidio project and or Neal Hot Springs project. If we&rsquo;re able to do that, we&rsquo;ll -- we should be able to replace the cash that&rsquo;s held in restricted accounts with the letter of credit for those specific projects, freeing of that cash. The cash totals roughly $22 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Would that happen in a year do you think or six months?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Our hope is over the same time period that we had mentioned over the next six months-ish that while we&rsquo;re looking at our strategic alternatives that that&rsquo;s one of the strategic alternatives that we&rsquo;re evaluating.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, keep up the good work and thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chip Richardson with Wedbush Securities. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chip Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Congratulations on another excellent quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Chip.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chip Richardson</strong></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re welcome. How long is the sort of time frame that you guys use to look at potential power purchase agreements from utilities? I&rsquo;m asking this because Portland General Electric is having to shut down their coal-fired power plant at Boardman or changed out, and they&rsquo;re looking at things and this occurs in 2020 or the shutdown. Is it prudent to begin trying to work with folks like that at this early stage or is that just too early for everybody&rsquo;s planning?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>2020 is probably -- I can&rsquo;t speak for them, but that&rsquo;s probably early for their planning but I think that would be somebody who we could talk to. The counterparties that we&rsquo;ve talked to to-date, one of them is looking at beginning of 2017 shutdown of a coal plant that they are part owners in. Another counterparty has a mid-2017 shutdown of a coal plant that they&rsquo;re invested in. Another one has early 2018 as far as the coal plant that they have ownership interest in that they&rsquo;re going to be shutting.</p>
<p>So, those that have those earlier days are definitely interested. Their expression of interest has been in base load power to replace the base load supply that we&rsquo;re getting from coal and the upside for us is that we&rsquo;re renewable. They don&rsquo;t see or they have expressed that they don&rsquo;t see the solar and the wind as being good strategic fit for doing that base load replacement. So, we&rsquo;re optimistic. We&rsquo;re having those discussions. And hopefully, we&rsquo;ll be able to give you an update later on how they developed.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chip Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Very good. My other question is how much additional potential is there at your existing sites like particularly Neal Hot Springs, I know early on, we&rsquo;re talking about an awful lot of additional potential with the Raft River sites and I know you&rsquo;re obviously expanding San Emidio. So, could you try and give us an update or there is still a lot of potential at both Neal and Raft River for additional plants over time?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>In the case of Neal, Neal on our resource there, we&rsquo;re seeing a zero decline, which is far better than our original forecast or plans for that project. That could imply that there is additional resource there beyond what we&rsquo;re currently producing but in order to be -- we tend to be conservative in order to continue to maintain that conservatism and not run into a situation where we overdevelop or overproduce the resource. We believe it&rsquo;s still early in order to make that determination. In the case of San Emidio, we&rsquo;re very optimistic with this current zone that we&rsquo;ve discovered and what yet is capable of producing is yet to be determined. So, I think it&rsquo;s still early to say there.</p>
<p>In the case of Neal -- I mean, excuse me, in the case of Raft, there is a huge resource that underlies that entire area. We developed the one project that I think as you know that one project we&rsquo;re running at 10 megawatts whereas 13 megawatt design. So, the power purchase prices available to us in Idaho currently are not very attractive to support additional development out in that area.</p>
<p>So, while the resource is there and in the future, should demand for those resources improve, we feel that we have ability to further develop that area. Right now, that&rsquo;s not prudent given the low prices in our PPA.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chip Richardson</strong></p>
<p>Very good. Thank you and keep up the good work and I do appreciate your conservative cases on all these things.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Chip. Appreciate your continued support.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Peter Rabover with Artko Capital. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Rabover</strong></p>
<p>Hey guys, thanks for all the color on the call. Can you maybe talk a little bit about the PPA that you see in California versus other states, especially there is a 50% renewal mandate, and given that you have such a high disparity between your other PPAs between $60 to $106, so, maybe give a little guidance on the prices that you&rsquo;re looking at now, that would be great.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>For further PPAs, as Doug had mentioned out in California, we&rsquo;re looking at community choice aggregators, we&rsquo;re looking at municipalities and we&rsquo;re looking at utilities as far as being the off-takers. There is also large consumers who individually could be an off-taker for you whether it&rsquo;s a college educational institution or whether it&rsquo;s just a large industrial consumer, they&rsquo;re able to buy directly from you too. Our primary focus has been on the community choice aggregators and the municipalities.</p>
<p>The utility seem to have reducing loads, although we are in discussion there as well. The price that you can get under the PPA really depends on what the needs of the particular off-taker are and what their supply stack has in it. We have talked to a couple of -- see, these were munis and the munis right now have their RPS needs met for the 33%, but are interested as the state develops out to a 50% RPS.</p>
<p>Right now, what we found is some of the off-takers, if their goal is only to meet the RPS, then they&rsquo;re going to buy the cheapest renewal board that they can buy, they&rsquo;re not interested in how it necessarily fits in to their portfolio or meets their overall long-term needs, they&rsquo;re just interested in it meeting their renewable attribute needs.</p>
<p>In that case, they typically go out and buy solar from the desert in Southern California or in Arizona or in Southern Nevada. If they&rsquo;re interested in the long term supply and if they&rsquo;re interested in a base load power supply source, then Geothermal is attractive.</p>
<p>Our particular Geothermal project, as I noted to one of the earlier callers, so much has been invested in that project, we&rsquo;re able to pass those savings or a substantial portion of those savings on to the off-taker and offer them a very cost competitive product.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you for that color. Do you have any, and I haven&rsquo;t had a chance to look at the Q, do you have an approximation of the costs for the Neal tower, cooling tower project?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Actually, that&rsquo;s a good question and it leads in to a couple of questions we received through the Internet and I&rsquo;ll just run through the questions quickly. Neal Hot Springs hybrid drilling is now complete. The press release said that one failed to meet Oregon requirements, is the second one okay?</p>
<p>And also followed by, once flow testing is complete and water supply is adequate, how long will it take to bring hybrid cooling online and of course your question, how much will it cost?</p>
<p>Our second well is complete, it&rsquo;s been flow tested. Is that the last well we&rsquo;re going to need? We can&rsquo;t answer that yet. What we want to make sure of is that the aquifer is able to produce water over the long term because remember this is a 25-year contract that we have to supply power for. So if the aquifer won&rsquo;t withstand that, it&rsquo;s hard to justify spending that extra capital.</p>
<p>The first one did fail because it communicated directly with shallow ground water. There are ground water rights in the area, so we can&rsquo;t take ground or surface water away from current water rights holders and that&rsquo;s the reason we can&rsquo;t use the first well. The second one is just fine. It&rsquo;s much farther away from that stream and in a different area. It does not communicate with any other surface water or wells in the area.</p>
<p>Our goal is to potentially have a hybrid cooling system in place sometime next summer or at the beginning of next season of course. It&rsquo;s going to be tight. We may or may not make that. We have designs underway as I said. We still have to prove that the aquifer will support water use long-term and the range of costs are considerable.</p>
<p>There is this cooling [ph] for instance which would be on the lower capital cost end, which is probably in the $5 million to $8 million range. A full cooling tower system for a plant this size could be as high as $15 million to $17 million, but they also produce different outcomes. So it&rsquo;s a full economic analysis that has to be done, not only looking at capital cost, but what the increase in generation and revenue will be for that particular technology.</p>
<p>So, there is lot of effort going in to making this decision, but first and foremost, we have to make sure we have enough water to pull it off.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>How would you finance that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Well, good question. It hasn&rsquo;t been resolved yet. If we just do a cash cow for the project owners, that would be ourselves and Enbridge, let&rsquo;s say if it&rsquo;s a $10 million project, $6 million would have to come from US Geothermal, where it has cash out of our bank account or we finance that, but yeah, and 40% would come from Enbridge.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And I guess one last question, so I don&rsquo;t monopolize, you guys mentioned interest from parties in acquiring you, would you categorize that as financial parties or strategic parties?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We have had and we continue to have interest expressed as long as our -- and I hate repeating it, but as long as our stock is trading at the levels that it&rsquo;s at, I think and as long as the company continues to perform strongly, I think the perception is that there is a value opportunity here and we are oftentimes approached either to acquire the company or to consider taking the company private.</p>
<p>Right now, our intent is to stay due course and to continue to develop the pipeline of projects that we have and continue to move this company forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. And, sorry I&rsquo;ll ask one more, Kerry when I met with you a few weeks ago, you mentioned that you guys were in talks at having a corporate credit line at the parent level. Now, given that you guys are profitable and maybe any update on that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Kerry Hawkley</strong></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve not moved forward on that yet, but it is still one of the options available to us as we consider all of these strategic alternatives.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thank you very much. I appreciate your time guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>We have had one other question come in from the web. The question is why don&rsquo;t we put our plants underground? It would be a lot cooler and is that possible?</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s not possible to my knowledge on how we would do that. So if the author has a suggestion on how that might be done, we would be all ears.</p>
<p>And operator, do we have -- we can take a few more questions up to the hour.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Yes, sir. We have one final question in queue. Our next question comes from the line of Bryan Lee with Private Management Group. Please go ahead with your question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Lee</strong></p>
<p>Hey, thanks for taking the question. Just back on the Geysers project, the original estimate there was a potential for 24 megawatts and then it was revised up to 30, so I guess just my question is, with the positive flow test out there, is that 30 number final or is there still another potential for revision there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Well, let me speak to that Bryan. The 24 figure that was originally, that was originally put forward considered standard cooling and so what it looks at is with standard cooling, with only 20% of the fluid going back in to the ground, over time, the generation output from the plant would diminish and so it was looking at it over a total life of the project.</p>
<p>With the hybrid cooling that we&rsquo;re currently proposing, we&rsquo;d be putting in 60% to 65% of the fluid back in to the reservoir. Historically, we&rsquo;ve seen in the Geysers that at that level of injection, the production from the facility is essentially flat. So that&rsquo;s allowed us to raise our figure and we&rsquo;re currently reflecting a 30.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve done the flow test of the wells. As noted, the test results were actually better than what we had anticipated. Our GeothermEx, our reservoir engineer is taking those results, putting those in to their black box so to speak, their numerical model, using their expertise in the area from both the Geysers and from reservoirs throughout the field and coming back to us with their projection of what the long-term sustainable production from that field is.</p>
<p>As Doug noted, we&rsquo;re expecting to have that report in late August, early September and so right now, it&rsquo;s just a projection, we will use the result of that report to come up with a final figure and we will move forward with our plant design and securing the PPA based on that final figure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bryan Lee</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thanks. Great quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Operator, do we have any other questions.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, we have no further questions at this time. I would like to turn the floor back over to Dennis Gilles for any closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Dennis Gilles</strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you all for calling in. The second quarter here typically is our leanest quarter and it will be on a going forward basis, it&rsquo;s when we have the lowest energy prices and so as a result of that, we take advantage of that time to take our outages on our plants and with the outages come reduced output and with reduced output come lower revenues.</p>
<p>But as we move forward in to quarter three and quarter four, quarter four in particularly, that is where really the highest revenues and the highest income for the company come about. Our plants are in great shape. We&rsquo;re well positioned to move forward and to take full advantage of the next six months and are very optimistic and encouraged.</p>
<p>And with all of that, we just thank you for your continuing support and your interest in our company and look forward to our next update in three months. Thank you everybody for calling in and have a nice day.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude our teleconference for today. You may now disconnect your lines at this time. Thank you for your participation and have a wonderful day.</p>
