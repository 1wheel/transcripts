<p>Let me now turn the call over to Bob.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Yorgensen</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Joe and good morning to everyone joining our call. I'd like to open by comments today by discussing our press release following yesterday's market close. On August 6, we received notification from NYSE that our trailing 30-day average stock price has not met the minimum $1 per share requirement for continuing listings.</p>
<p>The Company is therefore out of compliance with this element of the NYSE continuing listing standard. While we were quite surprised by the rapid drop in our stock price over the past 45 days, especially since the change in price seems to be disassociated with any fundamental catalyst, while we believe our current share prices undervalued, we'd also like to reassure you that we plan to take action to improve our stock price within the allotted six-months cure period typically granted by the NYSE under these circumstances.</p>
<p>The six-month cure period is predicated on NYSE's acceptance of our plan to address the price, which we are currently preparing for submission within the allotted 10-day period following the notification of non-compliance.</p>
<p>One of our options for improving the stock price is to execute a reverse split. For the moment however, we are not planning to pursue a reverse split. Rather we plan to continue to work with our strategic partner Zhenfa to improve the financial performance of our encapsulant business, while at the same time pursuing opportunities for strategic transactions. </p>
<p>Our focus is to increase value to our shareholders resulting in improvement of our share price as well as our market capitalization. The recent drop in our share price has driven a decline in our market capitalization to the extent that we are also now very close to the minimum market cap requirement for continued listings on the NYSE. The applicable standard for market capitalization is that for any consecutive period of 30 trading days, the company's market cap falls below $15 million and the company is out of compliance.</p>
<p>Unfortunately the NYSE does not afford a cure period once the 30-day average minimum market capitalization metric is breached. And as such, the breach would result in a suspension of trading and delisting of our shares on the NYSE. Should delisting of our shares from the NYSE occur, our plan is to remain public and shares would be traded on the OTC market through qualified brokers.</p>
<p>STR believes that the company's listing on the NYSE has value and we intend to take consorted action to protect our listing status for the benefit of our stockholders and to preserve optionality and potential for growth in the future.</p>
<p>Before covering some of our specific growth initiatives, let me just say few words about our stock price and market capitalization. We believe that both are undervalue at the moment. Considering that the company currently has more than $50 million of stockholders activity, which equates to over $2.80 of net book value per common share.</p>
<p>As a key majority stockholder with quantifiable synergies to explore and develop and also has a profitable encapsulant business in Europe with a growing encapsulant business in China. Our decision to close our factory in Malaysia should also demonstrate their willing to make very difficult decisions to further reduce our current cash burn by shedding down under performing assets to unlock capital.</p>
<p>More specifically and turning our attention now to our plan for improving the financial results of our company, I'd like to cover some of the important steps we have already taken to bring about positive change for STR stockholders.</p>
<p>The company has recently engaged account CohnReznick Capital Markets LLC to explore acquisition targets mainly in the downstream solar space where we believe growth opportunities exists and valuation multiples are higher than in the upstream sector. We have a solid balance sheet with no debt, which provides us with significant financial flexibility to address financing needs as they may arise for such opportunistic transactions.</p>
<p>Another area of interest for STR is downstream project development, financing and potentially ownership of independent power production assets such as solar farms. We believe we have important synergy in this area with Zhenfa through their market leading experience in the China solar downstream sector.</p>
<p>They have already begun to conduct due diligence on several projects brought to us by Mr. Qu Chao, who we recently appointed to the office of Vice President of Strategic Investment for STR Holdings Corporate.</p>
<p>Mr. Chao has a deep background in global connections and the downstream solar space through his work with Zhenfa and has already begun to develop a slate of projects for potential investment by STR, some of which we are actively pursuing now in Eastern United States.</p>
<p>Our plans for investment in these projects range from short term financing and development for sale, to on balance sheet IPP assets held for their recurring cash flow streams. Mr. Chao has also enjoyed success in his carrier in financing high quality downstream solar power projects, which we believe will aid us in pursuing this type of business expansion.</p>
<p>We've analyzing the downstream solar market for some time now and believe that Zhenfa and CohnReznick are exceptional partners to help us expand into this promising area of rapid growth with the goal of driving value to our stockholders.</p>
<p>Let's now move to our encapsulant business on Slide 5. While we were able to increase sequential sales in the second quarter, we have not ramped with new customers on our original schedule due to continued qualification delays.</p>
<p>As you may know, our largest customer ReneSola announced in May of this year that it will be exiting the module production business and has already terminated its OEM production in Malaysia. As a result of these developments, we implemented immediate restructuring actions as previously announced.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, we've stopped production at our Malaysia facility and have begun scaling back our workforce there and transferring our raw material innovatory facilities in Spain and China where we believe we have better opportunities for growth and financial improvement.</p>
<p>We've also engaged advisors to sell the Malaysian facility and its equipment. As a result of those actions, we expect to be able to convert approximately $8 million of PP&amp;E value back to cash less $1million to $1.5 million in associated non-recurring costs. On a going forward basis, we expect to generate approximately $2.4 million of annual pre-tax savings.</p>
<p>The closure of this facility should improve utilization in our encapsulant business allowing us to operate our China facility more efficiently. We intent to use the proceeds from the sale with the assets in Malaysia to operate the encapsulant business and also to support our efforts to diversify the company.</p>
<p>Currently our Spanish facility is generating incremental adjusted EBITDA and our goal is for our China facility to be able to do the same as we exit 2015. In order to improve our results at our China facility, we have implemented Management changes.</p>
<p>As previously announced, we have appointed Weijie Kong, as Vice President, Business Development and General Manager for China. In his role as General Manager, Mr. Kong is now leading STR China's encapsulant operations.</p>
<p>Mr. Kong will also focus on harnessing synergies with Zhenfa Group such as the recent module for encapsulant swap transaction between STR, ReneSola, and Zhenfa. We enter into this three party agreement in May enabling us to accept solar modules and settlement of approximately $7.5 million of outstanding accounts receivable.</p>
<p>In June, we received an initial cash payment from Zhenfa of $2.2 million. We expect to receive $3 million more this week and the remaining $2.3 million cash payment in September. We continue to believe that our ability to execute swap agreements with Zhenfa and our customers represents the unique competitive advantage created by our strategic transaction with Zhenfa and that these agreements will help STR increase our sales volumes, as well as the quality of our receivables.</p>
<p>As indicated on Slide 5, we have also recently appointed a new experienced Plant Manager in our Shajiabang factory in China who joins us from a successful Chinese competitor to support our growth initiatives in China as a key part of Mr. Kong's leadership team. </p>
<p>In addition to the above actions, we continue to work with Zhenfa to generate increased sales in China. As we mentioned on our prior earnings call, 14 Chinese module manufactures have agreed to evaluate our products.</p>
<p>As of the end of the second quarter, six of these prospects including one of the industry's leading module manufactures, have now issued commercial orders to the company. At the moment, we are working very closely with one prospective new customer to accommodate their range of production cycles. This particular prospect has several workshops with laminators for multiple sources and would like to be able to use our product in any and all of them.</p>
<p>To be clear, this means that we have passed all of the relevant qualification testing with this company and are in the fine tuning phase. During the second quarter, we made a successful run of 60,000 square meters in one of their workshops with no defects. This customer has indicated to STR that if we are successful in meeting their processing requirements, they will ramp to approximately 85 megawatts per month or 1 gigawatt per year with STR. As such, we expect this customer and other companies brought to us by Zhenfa to develop into new customers during the second half of the year.</p>
<p>In summary we are working diligently and more closely than ever with Zhenfa to restore our encapsulants business to profitability, while also pursuing diversification into the more profitable downstream solar sector.</p>
<p>Let me now turn the call back to Joe, to discuss our second quarter financial performance. Joe?</p>
<p><strong>Joseph Radziewicz</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Bob. Let's move to our second quarter financial results starting on Slide 7. Net sales for the second quarter of 2015 were $8.5 million compared to $11.2 million for the corresponding 2014 quarter. This 24% decrease was driven by a 13% volume decline and a 13% ASP decline.</p>
<p>The price decline was primarily caused by foreign exchange translation of the euro compared to the U.S. dollar. The average Euro exchange rate decreased by 20% in the second quarter of 2015 compared to the corresponding 2014 period. Ex-currency impact, our ASP declined by only 1%.</p>
<p>The volume decline was primarily due to a reduction of net sales to our largest customer, who modified its OEM partner footprint in the latter part of 2014, and began exiting its OEM business in 2015.</p>
<p>In addition, one of our European customers became insolvent in the first quarter of 2015. This European customer has since resumed operations and began ordering our encapsulant after a brief period of inactivity.</p>
<p>Sequentially, our net sales increased by 24% reflecting a 21% volume increase, and a 3% increase in ASP. The sequential volume increase was driven by new Chinese customer wins, as well as growth in the European and Indian markets.</p>
<p>Implied shipments for the second quarter of 2015 approximated 418 megawatts compared to approximately 362 megawatts in the first quarter of 2015 and 446 megawatts in the second quarter 2014.</p>
<p>Slide 8 shows the main components of the sequential change in gross loss. The slight improvement was driven by higher volume, improved ASP, lower restructuring charges and benefits from prior cost reduction actions. These positive impacts were partially offset by higher-resin purchasing cost and under absorption at our Malaysian facility due to lack of sales.</p>
<p>The higher increase in resin was driven by ethylene supply constraints in Europe due to unplanned shutdowns in maintenance. We believe that resin pricing should improve in the second half of 2015 as supply has recently come back online and the price of oil remains extremely low.</p>
<p>Slide 9 shows our selling, general and administrative expenses during the quarter. For the second quarter, our SG&amp;A was $2.8 million compared to $2.6 million in the first quarter. The $2,000 increase was driven by $2,000 of higher professional fees and a special charge of $1,000 for a state sales tax audit settlement.</p>
<p>Let's move to adjusted EBITDA on Slide 10. Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter of 2015 was a loss of $2.5 million compared to a loss of $1.8 million during the first quarter of 2015 primarily driven by $6,000 negative foreign exchange currency impact. This loss compared to an adjusted EBITDA loss of $4 million for the second quarter of 2014.</p>
<p>The year-over-year improvement was due to reduced gross loss and bad debt offset by increased SG&amp;A, R&amp;D and unfavorable foreign exchange currency impact.</p>
<p>Moving to Slide 11. Our effective tax rate from continuing operations for the second quarter was approximately 2%. As stated previously, we are not able to carry back losses in the United States, as such we will no longer record any income tax benefit in our P&amp;L as we will be recording full valuation allowance against any net loss generated.</p>
<p>Net loss from continuing operations on a GAAP basis during the second quarter of 2015, was $3.3 million or a loss of $0.18 per diluted share. This compares to a GAAP net loss during the first quarter of 2015 of $2.6 million or a loss of $0.14 per diluted share.</p>
<p>Diluted non-GAAP earnings per share for the second quarter of 2015 reflected a loss of $0.18 compared to a loss of $0.13 for the first quarter of 2015. The higher non-GAAP net loss per share was primarily due to higher EBITDA loss resulting from unfavorable foreign currency exchange impact.</p>
<p>Let me now discuss our liquidity and balance sheet on Slide 12. We continue to revaluate the liquidity of our balance sheet. We finished the quarter with $10.4 million of cash and no debt. We also had $8.3 million of income tax receivables and $5.3 million due from Zhenfa.</p>
<p>In addition, the company plans to sell its Malaysian real estate which is recently appraised at approximately $8 million. Over the past few quarters we have experienced increased accounts receivable investment associated with longer payment terms in China. This has negatively impacted our operating cash flow and results in cash balance.</p>
<p>We are working on a number of initiatives to accelerate our cash collections. For one, we continue to work with Zhenfa to leverage the Chinese relationships and position in a solar value chain as evidenced by our recent module for encapsulant swap transaction with ReneSola in which we collected 2.2 million of previously long-overdue receivables.</p>
<p>We expect to receive another $3 million of cash form Zhenfa this week and the remaining $2.3 million by the end of September.</p>
<p>In addition to the module for encapsulant swap, STR also received this business from Zhenfa in using its Chinese presence to collect other accounts receivable. In fact, just yesterday STR received a $2.1 million bank acceptance note from a large Chinese customer who is not paying STR. The bank acceptance note transfers credit risk from the customer to the financial institution and STR can either discount this note for cash, use the undiscounted note to pay vendors, or to hold to maturity and receive full face value.</p>
<p>These transactions evidence Zhenfa's ability to help STR in the Chinese market and provide STR with the competitive advantage in collecting accounts receivable in China which has not been easy to do, as one can see from our DSO performance over the past few years as shown on Slide 12.</p>
<p>In addition to leveraging Zhenfa's influence in the Chinese market, we are also investigating factory arrangements in Spain and China. The intention of this initiative is to improve our liquidity and fund working capital investment to shorten our cash conversion cycle.</p>
<p>We are currently in the final stages of negotiating factoring agreement for our Spain facility to sell with recourse certain European, U.S. and other foreign company based receivables through a financial institution located in Spain.</p>
<p>The maximum outstanding balance of this facility is expected to be €1 million with an annual discount rate of 2% plus LIBOR. We are also on the early stages of trying to secure factoring capability for our Chinese operations.</p>
<p>And with that operator, please open the call for questions.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Stine</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe you talked about the eight customers now qualified in China and recent customers brought to by Zhenfa, six ordering your sized the one, and I just want to be clear, the one that you think can ramp to a gigawatt, is that one that would be in the category that needs additional testing, so that would be the first question.</p>
<p>But then maybe of the six that have ordered, is there any way to provide some size of what you think those could potentially become per year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Eric just for clarity, the question you had on the first customer that we talked about that could ramp to one gigawatt, you wanted to know if there is more testing required there?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Stine</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, is that one of the six that has ordered and you think that ramp is kind of underway or are there additional steps, would that be in the category of one that needs re-testing, once it gets the orders, you think you can become a gigawatt?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, yes, good question and I understand the reason for your question. Normally recertification means it could be up six more months of delay. We don't think that’s the case with this particular customer at all.</p>
<p>They did order in the second quarter and as I mentioned we made 60,000 square meters for them that they were able to run very successfully in one of their workshops but this particular company has several different workshops with different laminators running at different settings in each of those workshops and even some laminators running at different settings within one of the workshops.</p>
<p>So the question for us is, can you handle the difference in processing temperature and time in all of these workshops. So the product worked for them but did like us to broaden the process window so they can use it anyway. And we are currently doing that working very closely within now.</p>
<p>So the timing on that one could be as soon as September to start production orders for them. It won't require a six-month recertification cycle.</p>
<p>The second part of your question was about kind of sizing the others. Yes, the six others, they're going to range from a couple hundred megawatts probably up to close to a gigawatt in one case. So there is a lot of business there, lot of potential business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Stine</span></strong></p>
<p>And I would though part of a process, so this is something that will take time to ramp. I know you've talked about looking for an inflection point in the second half. Does this do anything to that view? Does this just given that there are still some challenges there, things are working through in China that that inflection point is more of an early 2016 kind of timeframe or how do you think about that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>No, we're still thinking very solidly second half here.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Stine</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. That helps. I guess I am also just curious on the swap arrangement what, what kind of reception are you getting in the market? I know you've done it with one customer. Are other customers open to this? Are you in discussions with them in this regard any detail there would be helpful too?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Sure. We're indeed pursuing additional swap agreements and the interesting thing is that the transaction we made with Zhenfa makes this whole thing possible because they have the need to buy modules, but they also rely on other things. All of the components that go into solar farm they purchase.</p>
<p>So anyone out there who could be a customer of ours who also makes themselves any of those components would be a good candidate and we are in discussions with several companies right now about those kinds of things modules and other things like cable and other materials that are needing for solar farms.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Stine</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Got it. May be just on your plans going forward I know while you got a couple of things you're looking at potentially owning projects, project financing that sort of thing, but also hire the investment bank to look at transformative transactions.</p>
<p>So just maybe talk about how we should think about that or what form that could take? I know you've got a lot of ways that your balance sheet is likely going to be a fair amount stronger by the end of the year, but you're also balancing that with ramping your business. So just talk about what a transformative action could look like?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well first and foremost we still see a lot of opportunity in the encapsulant business. The way we pencil out encapsulant would be it's probably a billion dollar industry right now in just in encapsulant sales give or take okay. So even 10% of that is $100 million.</p>
<p>So for us it's still a very attractive marketplace and Zhenfa and STR both still committed to make that business work and make it successful. So that's our primary focus and frankly we think we're very close and we've got all the puzzle pieces in place now to be able to have success in the very near term. So we expect that to happen.</p>
<p>Aside from that we've seen the multiples of -- evaluation multiples on downstream businesses continuing to increase for several years now. So we're very interested in doing anything and everything we can within the solar vertical to help our shareholders increase their value in STR.</p>
<p>So we've looked at a number of companies on our own. We've been talking with CohnReznick for a while. We've looked at some of the candidates that they've suggested to us kind of casually and frankly we like very much what we see there.</p>
<p>So what we started is a more formal process of searching out an ideal candidate for STR and then doing the work to evaluate those transactions and then bring them in.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Stine</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. I guess all stay tuned on that. And then maybe one last one for Joe and I don't know I may have missed this, but did you call out the paperless mix in the quarter and how do you think about that trending throughout the year and in 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Joseph Radziewicz</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we were at 63% at the quarter pretty flat versus last quarter and we expect that to increase as we increase our sales in China in the second half. So that mix should improve.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Stine</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure Eric.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from Alex Raymond, who is a Private Investor.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Raymond</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. I just had a general question. Is the shift in process to the downturn still, is there more of a fundamental I guess shift in the progress of the core business or is that an ancillary avenue?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>I think, Alex this is Bob, I'll take that question. I think I wouldn't really call it a shift in focus because our focus of I mentioned is really still firmly on the encapsulant business. We see a lot of opportunity there. We think we're close to it. We've made a lot of changes not only in the organization, but in the formulation of our materials to be able to access the biggest market in the world, which is in China.</p>
<p>So we've been working hard on that and we'll continue to work hard on that. The desire to go downstream really goes back several years. We've been studying that space. We think it's a very good fit for STR, but then with the transaction with Zhenfa, it really brought that into more a focus and clarity for us because Zhenfa has got so much experience downstream.</p>
<p>So as I mentioned just a little bit ago, we've hired some executives from Zhenfa who are now on our Executive Team in STR Holdings and one of them is Mr. Chu and he has got a lot of great relevant experience in not only identifying, but financing downstream projects for Zhenfa and we're asking him to help us kind of get into that business as well.</p>
<p>And at the same time, working with CohnReznick who has got a great boutique investment bank with a lot of specialized focus in the new born. So that's how we're thinking about that. We wouldn't do a transaction if it wasn’t accretive to shareholders. So it won't be diverting our focus and it won't be taking value away from STT by any measure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Raymond</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thank you. And one other question, is the construction of the Zhenfa facility in is that on schedule or can you provide any update on that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. It's right now not progressing. So at the moment we have ample capacity still in Shajiabang. Just to give you a metric, in the second quarter, our utilization will grow at 24%. So we're disappointed with that. We're happy that we're able to grow sales little bit in the second quarter, but not nearly as much as we had desired.</p>
<p>So we have some equipment that's nearly finished being built that Zhenfa has contracted. So that's available to us to increase capacity on very short notice as soon as we need it and we hope to need it quite soon, but so far we have not required additional facilities or capacity to be able to land customers that we're pursuing.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Raymond</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. And one last question, can you talk about the gross margin for the business in China. I know you mentioned 11% in Spain. How is that or how do you get to that level in China?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Bob Yorgensen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes I said for the quarter we're negatively impacted by oil absorption in Malaysia and China as we start to ramp the team in China, but we do think still long term in this business, we could hit 15% to 20% gross margins at all of our facilities.</p>
<p>Second quarter we were also negatively impacted by resin really due to some supply constraints in Europe. There were seven force majora's implemented by the resin manufacturers during the quarter. That has now been elevated and we expect resin to be a tailwind for the rest of the year. So I think that would also be a key driver for us going forward.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alex Raymond</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] And I am not showing any further questions at this time. I would like to turn the call back over to Management for closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Bob Yorgensen</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. We just like to say very briefly in closing today, we're excited about where we are. We think we've put together some very key puzzle pieces to be able to drive growth in this business in the near term and we're very interested in pursuing the downstream together with Zhenfa and CohnReznick and we look forward to updating you on our next earnings call. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today's presentation. You may now disconnect and have a wonderful day.</p>
