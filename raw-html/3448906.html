<p><strong>Jifan Gao</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Yvonne. Good morning, everyone and welcome to our second quarter 2015 earnings call. Following our best first quarter ever, we achieved our strongest quarter in almost all financial and operating metrics for both upstream and downstream. We exceeded our high-end guidance and market expectations with module shipments of 1.23 gigawatts. More importantly, as we focused on profitable growth and sustainable growth, gross margin expanded to 20% from 18% and net income increased 170% to $43 million, thanks to our strong execution team. We lowered the in-house manufacturing cost by over 16% in the first half alone, beat our high-end – our year end target of $0.40 to $0.41.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, we continued to optimize the favorable mix of our shipments, in line with changes in global environment. We increased our presence in China, the U.S. and in fast growing and highly promising markets to offset the seasonal slowdown in Japan and the UK. Our ability to adapt quickly to market changes has paid off and is reflected in our improved fundamentals.</p>
<p>As demand in global solar markets continues to increase, our transition to relative asset light capacity expansion, we are able to quickly respond to growing demands, while maintaining manufacturing flexibilities. In addition, we are leveraging our better supply chain management, coupled with our technology and operation management advantages, while utilizing capacities from the Tier 2 and even Tier 1 module producers. This has enabled us to capture high growth opportunities, both upstream and downstream and maintain a healthy balance sheet. We believe our strategic measures, along with our industry leading scale and cost leader advantage, have strengthened Trina Solar’s ability to leverage the resources throughout the value chain and positions us well ahead of our competition during the period of the industry consolidation.</p>
<p>Moving to downstream business, we had 121 megawatts of new project connections to the grid, including 31 megawatts of DG projects, far exceeding our guidance of 65 to 75 megawatts. At the end of Q2 2015, we had a total of 359 megawatts operating assets, over 600 megawatts of utility and DG projects under construction and 800 megawatts in the late stage of project development.</p>
<p>Our flexibility, adaptability, faster response time, superior project execution, diversified funding channels, coupled with the improved credit environment to our projects for both utility and DG in China will enable us to emerge as the first class downstream player, while we solidify our leading position as one of the top module manufacturers.</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly comment on the China market. We continued to see tremendous progress in the transformation of China’s energy systems, with increasing focus on clean energy. From only public data, electricity generated from green energy increased by over 60% from the first half of 2014. We also see growth opportunities brought by China’s ongoing investments, increased infrastructure as well as the government’s determination to set key priorities accordingly. Halfway through the year, China has already completed over 40% of its 2015 target of 77 gigawatts of targeted 17.8 gigawatts and moreover projects are expected to connect to the grid in the second half of the year. We are confident that China will meet its target this year, with greater growth potential in the coming years.</p>
<p>Looking forward to the second half of the year with our leading technology, strong brand name and superior product, we will move one step further to our goal of becoming first class project developer and operator, while further solidifying our leading position as the world leading module manufacturer. Given the slower visibility of our business, we reached the module shipment target for the year.</p>
<p>With that, I would like now to turn the call over to Teresa Tan to review our operational and financial results for the discussion of the downstream business as well as to introduce our non-GAAP analysis and provide our Q3 and full year guidance. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Teresa Tan</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Mr. Gao and hello everyone. Welcome to our call. Today, I will give you two pieces of updates. The first portion would be an update for our module manufacturing business and the second portion will be an update of our financial results for the quarter. In the second quarter, we continued to see strong global demand, which helped us ship 1 gigawatt of modules to external customers. We shipped 37% of our total external volumes in China, making it the largest contributor to our Q2 volume and a new record for our selling into Chinese market. We were able to achieve such high volume. Thanks to our strengthened cooperation with our existing customers and broaden partnership with new customers. It is also a stamp of approval from our customers for the portfolio of our high quality and differentiated products that we offer. For example, we signed a 50 megawatt project in Yunnan. This project would be solely equipped with our Duo-Max modules. Once completed, it will be the largest ground mounted Duo-Max project in the world. And it will be a showcase project for promoting our Duo-Max module in China.</p>
<p>We believe this trend of Chinese customers seeking high-quality products will continue through the rest of the year and beyond. We have already secured a number of large high-quality orders, which will help us meet our targets in the coming quarters. Our shipments to the U.S. also hit a new record high, increasing 60% quarter-over-quarter to 324 megawatts and making it the second largest region for us after China. We have seen continued strong incremental growth, thanks to our strong sales network by putting demand before the ITC expiration at the end of 2016. Today, we are almost fully booked for Q3. We have also built a strong backlog for Q4 and have decent visibility into 2016. We believe with our high efficiency and cost effective products and our ability to expand our overseas manufacturing capacity and international partnership, we are well prepared to maintain our position in the U.S. market and capture more growth opportunities.</p>
<p>Moving over to Japan and the emerging markets, in Japan in the first quarter of this year, we saw a surge in demand ahead of the end of the favorable FIT pricing. So the second quarter, a drop from the first quarter high was expected, but our sales will pickup in the second half. Looking at India, similar to Japan the second quarter is traditionally a slow season. However, we maintained stable volume and we continued to improve our business and market share by cooperating with our high quality customers.</p>
<p>Now looking at our overseas capacity expansion, we have been making steady progress on our Thailand facility and we expect to start serving overseas demand early next year. Our Malaysian partner also started to deliver shipments this quarter as previously scheduled. In addition, overseas OEM network is improving as well. We are also planning to expand our capacity in other strategic overseas market to strengthen our global presence. As of June 30, 2015, we have annualized in-house production capacity of 2.3 gigawatts for ingots, 1.8 gigawatts for wafers, 3.2 gigawatts for PV cells and 4.4 gigawatts for modules. The capacity increase for ingots and wafers was largely driven by upgrades to our existing equipment and technology advancements.</p>
<p>In terms of technology, we believe it is vital for us to keep developing and producing cutting edge products. In the first half of 2015, our scientists and researchers at Trina Solar’s State Key Laboratory of PV science and technology continued to develop a low-cost industrial version of an advanced IBC cell and constructed an initial pilot line for IBC cells and modules. We have obtained an extraordinary peak efficiency level of up to 23.1%, and average efficiency greater than 22% with those modules. The IBC pilot line is fully commissioned and the first batch of IBC modules have been built.</p>
<p>As you may have seen in the recent report that our IBC cells and modules equipped Osaka Sangyo University’s solar car and won in the 2015 FIA Alternative Energies Cup Solar Car Race held in Suzuka, Japan. We are proud to be a market leader with our high efficiency solar technology and I am confident that with increasing demand for our current portfolio of innovative products, such as our Duo-Max, Trinasmart and Honey Plus series of modules our R&amp;D team will continue to push innovations to strengthen our position in the global market. Looking forward, we are confident that with our proven execution capabilities in key operational markets, our ability to remain cost competitive, along with our cutting edge technology, our compelling product design and our strong global branding will help us continue to increase our market share and solidifies the leading position of our upstream module business in this rapidly changing industry.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to move on to the second portion of my update on Trina’s Q2 financials. As Mr. Gao mentioned the second quarter marks our second straight quarter of record results and 8th consecutive quarters of profitable growth. Our total shipments for the second quarter reached 1.23 gigawatts, beating our expectations of 1.1 gigawatts to 1.14 gigawatts. Net revenues were $722.9 million, an increase of 29.5% sequentially and an increase of 39.2% year-over-year.</p>
<p>Gross margin in the second quarter was 20%, increasing from 18% from last quarter and 15.4% from Q4 of last year. This was primarily because of our ongoing cost reduction initiatives, at the same time, maintain a relatively stable ASP. In this quarter, we continue to make progress in executing our cost reduction strategy well ahead of our schedule. As a result, our in-house cost reached $0.39, declining 7% sequentially and 19% year-over-year. There were number of reasons contributed to this result. First, the drop in raw materials prices across the value chain. Secondly, our supply chain management maximized our utilization of resources. Number three reason, the advantage of greater economies of scale in managing our operations continued to be favorable. And fourth, our efficiency management improved the output per capita. And last but not least, improved efficiency, driven by technological advancements across the entire manufacturing process, also helped the cost reduction.</p>
<p>Operating income was $60.7 million, a significant increase of 108.1% from last quarter, $29.2 million. EBITDA in the second quarter was $99.5 million, compared to $61.2 million last quarter. Net income increased 174% sequentially to $43.1 million.</p>
<p>To support our rapid growth, we continued to maintain a strong balance sheet. Our liability to asset ratio stands at 70%. Our cash balance at the end of the second quarter stood at $616.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash. Total bank borrowings were $1.02 billion, of which $924.2 million was short-term borrowings. We expect the percentage of long-term borrowings to increase in the second half as more long-term project financings are in place.</p>
<p>In terms of CapEx, we mentioned in our first quarter results that we expect the CapEx needed for our module business to be around $300 million to $350 million this year and total CapEx needed for downstream business is around $1 billion. This expectation remains unchanged. The funding environment for ground-mounted projects has matured and ready access to funds supported our project development.</p>
<p>Also, our module business has become self-sufficient in terms of operating cash flow. However, to ensure that our growth can be sustained, we continue to develop new sources of financing in order to meet our capital needs. In addition to the traditional bank loans, we have also looked into other options to finance the downstream business, including lease finance. With our well-established network of financial institutions we partner with, we continued our efforts to ensure that we have sufficient funds to capture the key market opportunities when they arise.</p>
<p>A recent example is our recent breakthrough in distributed generation. We have signed an agreement to develop a 13 megawatt solar roof project for Volkswagen. When the project is completed, it will become the largest DG project in China. This project is funded by China Construction Bank, the second biggest bank in China by assets. And we have received all the fundings as of today. Going forward, we remain committed to securing more reliable sources of financing to secure Trina Solar’s continued growth for both utility and DG segments.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to move on to our non-GAAP financial updates. As mentioned in the last two quarters, we used non-GAAP disclosures to more fairly represent the true face of our profitability, of our P&amp;L due to the restrictions placed on recognizing module sales to our own internal projects. Also, the downstream assets captured on our balance sheet are creating more value, but this value may not have been fully recognized by the market. Therefore, our non-GAAP financials comprises of module business and the downstream business.</p>
<p>In terms of modules, for the second quarter of 2015, while we shipped 1 gigawatt of modules on a GAAP basis, we also shipped an additional 231 megawatts to our own downstream project. So, on a non-GAAP basis, our total module shipments were 1.23 gigawatts. Using the same approach, our non-GAAP revenues for this quarter would have been $816 million, our cost of goods sold would have been $653 million, our gross profit would have been $163 million and our gross margin will be 20%.</p>
<p>In terms of retained project assets, as of the end of Q2 2015, we have over 300 megawatt projects in China retained on our balance sheet that are operating. This includes 300 megawatt utility scale projects and a total of 35.2 megawatt of DG projects. The estimated retained value of the total 335.2 megawatts of solar power project is $483 million, using 8% discount rate and $502 million using 7.5% discount rate.</p>
<p>Finally, in terms of outlook and guidance, I will summarize briefly here the full details can be found in our earnings release. For Q3, 2015, we expect to ship between 1.45 gigawatts to 1.5 gigawatts of PV modules, of which 170 to 190 megawatt of PV modules will be shipped to our downstream PV project. As for downstream projects, we expect to connect 180 megawatts to 200 megawatts of PV projects to the grid in quarter three. Given the strong demand to our products, we are raising our full year 2015 module shipment targets to between 4.9 gigawatts and 5.1 gigawatts, of which 700 to 800 megawatts will be shipped to the company’s downstream projects. All-in-all, we are pleased for what we are able to deliver in the first half of the year and we certainly hope our strong performance to continue in the second half.</p>
<p>With that, I would like to turn the call back to Yvonne. Yvonne?</p>
<p><strong>Yvonne Young</strong></p>
<p>Operator, I think we can now open the call to questions. Thank you.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Philip Shen. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Philip Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Mr. Gao, Teresa, Yvonne, congratulations on some nice results. So, you guys are fully booked in Q3, you have a strong order book for Q4, I know it’s early, but what kind of bookings if any are you seeing for 2016? And we have seen some of your peers lock in some large orders in the U.S., given the expiration of the IPC at the end of 2016. Do you see any potential for some similar opportunities for Trina?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. For Q3, as I discussed earlier, in U.S. a number of key markets that we are very much booked and then we extend into Q4. And we see very steady order coming in. Some of them have signed also going into 2016. And as to what you have asked about in U.S. market, we see very strong market demand in 2016 and very likely to match or even surpass the demand in 2015 in that market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Philip Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks, Teresa. In terms of your cost structure, what was your cost per watt in Q2? And relative to your target by year end of $0.40 to $0.41 per watt, how do you see your cost structure trending in 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>We continued to see cost reductions on the going forward basis. This year was a very exceptional year. We have achieved much faster and even surpassed the goal for the cost reduction that we set for this year. And we continue to see a 5% to 6% of reductions in the coming year. And we certainly hope that the operation will deliver stronger results, surpass our expectation as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Philip Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. One more question for me, with your asset-light capacity strategy, you are expanding into Thailand and Malaysia, given your increasing guidance and what’s your latest view on additional capacity expansion in either ‘15 or ‘16 beyond what you have announced?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, we – I discussed a little bit earlier, but then I am very happy to talk a little bit further from what we have said. This year, we actually – our target was to reach the module capacity of 4.8 gigawatts and it looks like we are very much well on our target – on our way to reach the target. And on a going-forward basis, we are looking at number of key markets. For instance, the India market is one of the markets that we are evaluating in a very active manner. We are looking at the potential module and cell capacity in India market and we are in the process of collecting sites at this point. And we are also looking at potential markets where we can establish our presence in Latin America as well as in Europe. So we are actively looking, but then the manner of expansion will be in multiple ways. Not only the way that we have set before as co-operations, but also could be partner with other people or utilizing other people’s or other company’s facilities to keep on executing our relative asset-like strategy. So we are definitely looking forward to 2016, which we believe would be another very strong year globally in addition to some of the key markets where we have a significant presence.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Philip Shen</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thanks Teresa. Congrats again on nice results.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Phil.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Patrick Jobin. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Maheep Mandloi</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, this is Maheep Mandloi on behalf of Patrick Jobin from Credit Suisse. Quick question for – on the financing environment you gave an update on the visibility you have over there for funding the projects, could you give more color on what appetite you see for downstream assets over there, any other funding avenues apart from debt and leasing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. I will be happy to discuss that. For our downstream projects, we see very active and very healthy appetite for the projects regarding support – supporting the projects with financing. And we are looking at not only the major banks that has always been active starting from last year, but there we are looking at many different ways of different forms of financial institutions very actively participating and also it includes the active payers includes regional bank which they are maybe smaller, but very quick in taking actions. And they are actually very, very active in seeking the financing opportunities and partner with major players like Trina. And one other things that I would comment on this is that as we are seeing more and more active and – participation from the financial institutions, we also have the knowledge that this is not a blind support by the financial institutions for all the projects out there, because the financial institutions are more and more focused on quality and they are more and more focused on the assets knowing that they will be around for a long time. And this is a very healthy focus which we are very welcome that kind of focus. And so from our perspective, we are definitely seeing a lot more possibilities to partner with the big banks and also the regional banks as well as other funds and leasing companies. And also partnerships who may want to strategically partner with us in developing projects and grow their business. So we definitely see a very healthy appetite.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Maheep Mandloi</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks. That’s helpful. And just on the shipment guidance for the whole year, the additional 500 megawatts of guidance, can you help us where do you see that coming from, is it mostly China or U.S.?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>We are seeing – actually we are seeing increases from different regions including the major markets and China is definitely one of them and U.S. is another one. And we are also seeing faster growth from emerging markets like India. And we are seeing new markets as Latin America, as well as Middle East. So from our perspective, we are very comfortable that the revised targets that we set for the year will be reachable and we are happy to be able to be in that position to provide a higher guidance.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Maheep Mandloi</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks and congratulations on the quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Mahesh Sanganeria. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mahesh Sanganeria</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thank you very much and congratulations on a very good quarter. And my question on the cost side, can you talk a little bit about how much of cost reduction is coming from the commodity prices. And maybe you can talk a little bit about poly prices, the poly prices have been pretty favorable, at the beginning of the year expectation was the poly price will start to increase, but is your expectation that poly prices will continue to decline and maybe you can comment on other commodities and impact of that on your prices – on your cost? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure, Mahesh. Yes, the cost has come down for us especially the in-house manufacturing cost and that is actually coming from multiple sources. One of the source actually is coming from the poly cost, but that is about 10% reduction from $0.10 of Q1 to about $0.09 in Q2. And other materials has dropped as well close to 10%. So that was actually quite healthy from our perspective to capital cost reduction. In addition to that, our cost reduction also come from labor reduction as well. As you have probably noticed that with our significant increase of module shipment and manufacturing, our labor force actually reduced and that is another way to show that we actually are able to increase our productivity and therefore, reduce the cost per capita. So the cost for in-house manufacturing is reducing, but at the same time we have to point out that due to our restriction on the capacity, we have to increase our outsourcing for this quarter as well as the coming quarters, so that actually will increase the cost a little bit and that was reflected in our second quarter overall cost for the total $0.48 as a blended module cost that we present to you today.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mahesh Sanganeria</span></strong></p>
<p>Actually that’s – I have a follow-up on your earlier comment on that one. If I look at the module business versus the project business, it looks like your gross margins are definitely improving on the module business and maybe even better than the project business and project business is requiring so much capital. And you can improve your margins probably by bringing in more production in-house, so how do you balance that – those two businesses, I would think that you should be focusing more on the module business, considering that some of your customers and competitors are having problems with raising capital for the project business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Sure, I would be happy to discuss that. From Trina’s perspective, obviously every company has its own strategy in expanding their capacity, but from Trina’s perspective, we are very focused on the midstream that means we are focusing on the capacity increase on the cell capacity as well as the module capacity and we are not investing in the upstream, meaning the poly and wafer capacity expansion on those is not part of our strategy and that will continue to be the case. And so on a going forward basis, we will continue to see ourselves partner with the upstream suppliers and we believe that this will help us to maintain our relatively asset-light approach and reach our target to have sustainable growth.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mahesh Sanganeria</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Vishal Shah. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vishal Shah</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, hi. Thanks for taking my question. Teresa, can you maybe talk about your margin expectations for the second half? And also your plans for the downstream business in China are you looking to expand in 2016 as well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you repeat the last one, once again?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vishal Shah</span></strong></p>
<p>Your plans for the downstream business in China, are you looking to expand your portfolio projects on hand in 2016 as well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes, sure. Let me talk a little bit about the downstream business not only for the second half, but going forward basis. For the downstream business, we are looking at the market to have very healthy demand and we have seen that not only China, but number of other countries as well that has very focused and more high profiles focused on the downstream business in the process of seeking clean energy and healthy environment. So, we are definitely expanding our efforts in increase our portfolio, not only in China, but also in other countries, in addition to our established markets like UK and Japan, we are also expanding into other countries. For instance, India, we are very active in looking at the projects and business opportunities there and we believe that this is a very big region and high growth region and we very much intend to be a significant player there and we will look for local partners as well to help us and partner with us to grow together in this very important market. And so from China perspective, we are definitely looking at not only meet this – the target that we set for this year, but looking forward, we are looking at further growth our target and further increase our investment as well to – into our downstream business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vishal Shah</span></strong></p>
<p>How do you plan to fund the downstream operations, you said you will need about $1 billion this year, what kind of financing you are looking at for next year as well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. Yes, this is a very important question, very much a question that we ask ourselves and looking for solutions as well. For this year, for the 700 to 800 megawatts projects that we have planned that we are in process of completing, we very much looked at all the options we have and look for favorable options out of the ones that we have and secure as we go the financing for the project. So, for the rest of the year, we believe that as we progress on the business side into meeting our targets, we also progressed very nicely in securing financing for the projects that we have currently developing and constructing. So, going forward basis, we have discussed our desire to separate the downstream business into a separate listing so that we can create a financing platform for the downstream business, which is quite different from our module business and manufacturing business. So, we believe that this is the way to go as far as timing and as far as the markets where the spin-off could happen. This is very much still in discussions and we are also very much in very active discussion actually with our supporters and resources that we are working with.</p>
<p>On the other hand, there are multiple ways of – new ways of financing for downstream. As you probably have also noticed in the market that there are number of options, such as green bond options that is very much available for renewable energies than we have seen recent cases, successful cases in the market that is something that we are also studying. And also there are many other sources of strategic partners that are very active in looking to partner with us and that is also something that we are evaluating as one of the options to secure financing. So, we believe that there are a number of options that will be strong support for our meeting the target for the next year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vishal Shah</span></strong></p>
<p>That’s helpful. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Nitin Kumar. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nitin Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, hi. Thanks, guys and congratulations on a very strong quarter. I mean, a lot of things have already been answered, but I am just trying to understand, if I compare the 20-F guidance – capacity guidance to what has been provided in 2Q, it seems you have actually brought down some of your capacity expectations, is that a push out of, I mean, in some areas or is that more related to I mean I don’t know timing issues?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Actually, that’s probably not the case that we see a demand receiving from what we are expecting a high growth year. Traditionally, Q3 is a very, very high volume quarter because of the grid connections that people are targeting before the end of the year. So, the fact that we have revised our overall full year guidance and the fact that we have provided bit higher guidance for the third quarter and maybe slightly lower guidance for fourth quarter for the difference, I don’t think there is just much of a message of slowing down. As a matter fact, we expect that to be leveled from Q3 to Q4.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nitin Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. The other thing is that your diluted share count has actually increased quite significantly from 1Q to 2Q, any particular reasons for that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>I am sorry would you repeat the question again?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nitin Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p>The diluted share count, right, in 2Q has gone up from – I mean, if you basically compare, has gone up quite substantially. So, it’s gone up from 97.2 in 1Q to 105.2. So, I am just trying to understand those 8 million additional shares, I mean, what kind of has that come in from?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, okay. Well, I would be happy to explain a little bit. I know it’s a relatively complicated issue, but I think now maybe I can explain this in a layman’s language and see if I can be successful in explaining. As you know that we have a basic share of about 85 million. And then on top of that we had two follow-on shares that we did last year, one in June, one in October and because of the two follow-on shares, that are related to convertibles, they are only diluted when they meet certain conditions. And when in the first quarter of this year, only the June 2014 shares were dilutive and that’s why they were included in the Q1 total shares. But now in Q2, when we do the calculations based on the required shares for dilution, the fully diluted method in U.S. GAAP required we do that comparison. And as we do that calculation, the number one follow-on and also the number two follow-on, both become dilutive and that’s why the total shares were increased, because of the shares related to the convertible bonds issued in last year. I hope that explains a little bit.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nitin Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p>It does. Thank you. The other thing is – I mean we did – there has been quite a few questions on the source of the capital for the project I mean the further expansion on the project side of business. Thanks for the commentary around what are the other markets you are looking for, I am just trying to understand, you mentioned and that the – I mean the company is looking at all the options including a separate listing, what could be the timeframe that you would want – you would need to do it for continued access or I mean what kind of limitations are there in I mean bringing it forward or bring it – I mean pushing it forward in terms of I mean listing of that asset?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. Well, that’s a question of – $1 million question almost, the fact that the market condition changes and the fact that the company – every company is different and its strategy and their target is determined what kind of strategy that they will deploy. So from Trina’s perspective, we need to evaluate not only the appetite from the investor perspective, but also the future financing options and possibilities for our downstream business as well. And so because most of our assets on our balance sheet are from China, we also need to make sure that the market that we select recognize the value of those assets and also will support that kind of development as well. So like I said, this evaluation is very complex situation and actually it really changes overall conditions and the macro economy condition changes as well. So it’s almost like a – it’s a very active evaluation that I should say. But as far as clear plan, it is very hard to give a very clear plan and we will be sure to communicate with the market as we – as the plan becomes clear.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nitin Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. If I may just like ask a bit more, if you look at the TerraForm Global the notes issue was at 9.75%, obviously that’s significantly higher than the kind of rates you can get for domestic bond issues, does that mean that more and more issues going forward could actually be in the domestic market in China rather than in U.S.?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Do you mean the downstream business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nitin Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Before the downstream business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Well, actually it turned out that the overseas business has accounted for less than 10%. That’s partially, it’s because of the very, very robust demand and very healthy kind of development in China, where we have to dedicate more resources to capture while the opportunity presents. And so it turned out to be that higher percentage of projects and development happened in China. But on a going-forward basis and we still very much focusing on not only develop our business in China, but also overseas like I mentioned earlier that we are looking at markets like India, we are also looking at markets in Latin America and we believe that we have a good chance to proceed in those growing markets as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nitin Kumar</span></strong></p>
<p>I understand. Last question for me, Teresa, I mean touching on something Mahesh asked before, on the use of capital, right I mean there is clearly a consolidation happening on the module side of the business, margins for all the module guys have been I mean strong, pretty much strong as it has been in 3 years or 4 years. As we go into next year, we are probably going to see even more capacity tightness particularly in the cell and module space, how should we think in terms of capacity growth, I mean is the company going to be focused more on market share or is it going to be more on I mean maintaining profitability of looking at I mean, trying to create a balance on the future capacity expansion?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. It’s very good question, because in our strategy discussions, we also found it over and over again our over this question as well, because this is very much – very key factor in our strategy going forward for our module business. From management perspective and from Trina perspective, we have to balance the number of factors. We need to meet the customers demand. We need to meet the fast growth in modules market including the key markets. So we definitely need to increase our capacity, not only because this is one of the ways for us to capture the market, but also to will establish further of our leading as one of the top manufacturer for the – as the module manufacturer. But now, on the other hand, we are also very much focused on profitability as well and we want to make sure that we not only expand our capacity, we not only capture the market share or increase our market share, but also not to lose sight on the profitability.</p>
<p>I know that many – there are many concerns out there that as you are too focus on the market share, maybe you will lose sight on the profitability. And this is definitely not happening in Trina. We are very much focused on profitability and we want to make sure the balance, the different factors and different demand do not only long-term wise, we want to have sustainable growth. So we are not just looking at one quarter or two quarters, we are looking at 3 years, 5 years down the road where we are we need to be period and that’s why we believe we will still continuously evaluate the possibility of the increasing capacity using our relatively light – asset light approach. But at the same time, we would make sure that we keep profitability very much in front of us.</p>

<p>Your next question comes from the line of Emily Liu. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Emily Liu</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, congratulations on good quarter and thanks for taking my question. I think my question is more on the technology roadmap, because I see the success of Duo-Max and IBC and it seems to me that efficiency is high efficiency cells are one of the product depreciation and I wonder whether it’s possible to give us an update on your efficiency roadmap and also how does that tied in with the CapEx guidance, I think I have $275 million for the year including $160 million for Thailand expansion? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Technology is one of our very vital portion of our business, so we believe this will separates apart from our peers and we believe that this is one of the force to keep us to have a sustainable growth going forward and become more and more of a leader in this field. And if you look at the past quarter, our efficiency for the cells that we have installed in our production is for the mono cells. And also the multi cells, they have reached – for mono cells, it has reach to more than 19%, 19.3% average for the second quarter. And for the multi modules and cells the capacity – the efficiency has reached close to 18%.</p>
<p>Now, one other things that I want to highlight is you probably have seen some of our announcement in the past couple of months, where we have set the record for our multi-modules. One of them is a very significant where the efficiency has past 19%, which in the past, we always believe that this is they way the mono modules and cells will be able to produce, but we are able to do that with multi-cells and multi-modules. So there is still much room for us to advance. And also one of the things that we have done and I mentioned earlier a little bit that we are expanding our capacity for high efficiency modules manufacturing capacity. And so by the end of the year, we will reach much higher capacity for the module compared to our current capacity.</p>
<p>And for instance, our current capacity for this year – by the end of the year will reach more than 200 megawatts, which is very significant and by next year, 2016, our capacity will increase for the product to almost 500 megawatts and those high-efficiency products will allow us to penetrate further into the market, where customers are more and more demand of the high-efficiency products, especially as residential DG business is picking up as we are expecting. So, we believe that the product line that we are expanding is very much a key for our continued success. And another example that you probably saw was the product sales that was equipped with the solar products that won the race by large compared to as many of the number two and number three in the race. And that was very much another proof that we are ahead of the competition and produce the high-efficiency cells in the total modules. So, again, we will continue our efforts in this area and we hope that the team will continue to produce the impressive results as they did in the past.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Emily Liu</span></strong></p>
<p>Just to make sure I understand, you have 200 megawatt of PERC capacity by the end of this year and 500 by end of next year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>That is our target.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Emily Liu</span></strong></p>
<p>And do you get premium by selling PERC modules? What kind of price premium you see?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, actually – yes, currently, the high-efficiency modules demand a price premium. Of course, how much of a premium depend on the market from market-to-market, but it does have the premiums that we are able to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Yang Lu [ph].</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking the questions. This is Yang calling on behalf of Frank. We have three questions in total. First is how much revenue is booked for the 50 megawatts project cells in second quarter and what is the gross margin for the cells? And the second question is annual revenue bookings from downstream solar project cells? And the third question is with the broad curtailment and the receivable issues for downstream solar projects, what is the strategy for Trina to manage the risk? Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. I may have to ask you to repeat the second and third question, but let me answer your first question first. The UK project that was sold in June, the second quarter, contributed to our bottom line in the second quarter and the 15-megawatt project was connected in the first quarter and we are very happy to partner with Bluefield again to complete the sale. And the margin is in this low 20s. When you consider other cost together and that’s very much in comparable – comparable with other two projects that were sold earlier in 2014. So, that answers your first question, but then I apologize speak slowly on your second question again please.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Second question is electricity sales revenue for downstream projects?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Electricity revenue?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes, in the second quarter, the electricity revenue is about $12 million compared to $10 million in the first quarter. And that’s very much in line with what we expected according to the grid connection progress. And I also believe that for the year, we have targeted about $70 million in total for the electricity revenue for this year 2015 and we are expecting approximately $20 million for third quarter and the rest in the fourth quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much. And the third question is – the third question is about the broad curtailment and – yes, could hear me?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>No, the line is breaking. I really apologize for the quality of the voice. I don’t know how if you guys can hear me okay, but I have a very hard time because of the poor quality of the line. So, I apologize for that. But if you could repeat your third question again, I appreciate it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much. No problem. We see broad curtailment and the receivable issues for downstream solar projects, what is the Trina strategy to manage the risk?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, okay. I understand you are asking about the receivable questions, right for the downstream business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Teresa Tan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Yes, I will be happy to discuss that. As you know that the downstream business, the revenue comes from two major portions, the first one is coming from selling the electricity, which we – most other projects that were connected after a initial processing time, we are receiving on a regular basis the revenue from electricity companies or from the users for the DG business. And those are very much in progress. But now, the second piece is related to the FIT, the feed-in-tariff, which I think in many people’s minds, including ours that the payment has been delayed and I may want to discuss this in separate portions, one is for utility basis, one is for DG business. For the utility basis, FIT, we are seeing that the delay is between 12 to 18 months and we are working very actively, including engaging our association, including engaging the active dialogue with government officials to push for faster processing of the FIT payments. And recently, we have received another request for survey of the AR on the FIT overdues, basically overdues from the government. And we see that as an effort from the government to understand the extent of the problem and hopefully thinking of a way to expedite the processing of the FIT payments in solving the problem of the lack of funding to those FIT payments.</p>
<p>But now, coming to the DG business, we are seeing much faster payments from the FIT perspective for DG projects. And we have not seen much of delay after the grid connection once an initial processing time is passed. So, for instance, for the target that we have connected in the first quarter for the DG business, we are now receiving, on a regular basis, on a monthly basis for the project that we for the FIT payments, retroactively back to the day one when the grid connection was made. So, that we actually see that as a very positive sign for receiving the payment. And also, it very much depends on where the project is located for the DG business. In different province, they have different process in different times to process the FIT payments, but we are seeing encouraging signs of much faster processing for the company to receive the FIT payments. So, I hope I explained this from different ways to make this problem or this issue much clear our listeners best on the call.</p>
