<p>I would now like to turn the call over to Robert Fagenson. Robert?</p>
<p><strong>Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ed. Welcome and good morning everyone. I hope you’re all enjoying the same magnificent weather we are here in the northeastern United States and that that incredible market reversal we saw yesterday afternoon continues for all of you who are long; and for those of you who are short, I’m sorry. </p>
<p>On today’s call, I’ll start with some brief opening remarks about our financial and operational performance during the quarter and then turn the call over to my partner, Mark Goldwasser, who will give you a review of our business segments. Following Goldie’s remarks, we’ll hear from our new Executive Vice President of Finance, Glen Worman, who will provide some brief comments about operational initiatives that we have underway and discuss our financials in the third fiscal quarter of 2015 in greater detail. Once Glen is finished, I’ll wrap up and then we’ll open the call to your questions.</p>
<p>Despite challenging market conditions, we’ve built on our track record of profitability and on a quarter-over-quarter basis generated higher EBITDA after adjusting for some third quarter non-recurring expenses. We’re very encouraged by our third quarter results, and while the reported number might seem to suggest that we haven’t made significant progress on revenue and profits, we’re going to explain to you why that’s not the case and why we have cause for optimism looking forward.</p>
<p>On the revenue side, we continue to feel the weight of a choppy market environment for trade execution. This generally has a depressing effect on commissions as well as transfer fees, clearing services, and other fee-driven components of our revenue stream. Market volatility, energy and commodity prices, China, uncertainty about what the Fed may or may not do have all contributed to the types of markets that give retail investors the jitters and lead to lower volumes. These factors have created some headwinds for us in our principal transaction business as well, particularly the persistently interest rate environment.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, because of our diversified business model, we’re able to offset much of this weakness in the quarter with record investment banking results and a continued recovery in alternative investment product sales. In fact, our alternative investment sales have rebounded to the best levels since the interruption in that business in October of 2014. </p>
<p>While we’ve been adding registered representatives and advisors at a steady pace in recent quarters, the incremental revenue uplift and profit contribution from these additional team members are not always immediately apparent. That’s because it can take time for these registered reps and advisors to complete the account and asset transfer process and to ramp up their business to normalized production levels once they’ve joined National. We expect the full benefit of these additions of new advisors and reps will become evident in both top and bottom line numbers in subsequent quarters.</p>
<p>On the profit side of the ledger, continued expense control kept our net income and adjusted EBITDA positive for the third quarter. We did record some non-recurring expenses which had a depressive effect on the bottom line. These one-time expenses were related to compensation, legal fees, consulting fees and other provisions, and added up to $800,000 in the quarter. Adjusting for these items, pre-tax income would have been around $1.2 million and adjusted EBITDA would have been approximately $1.8 million. By comparison for the second quarter of fiscal 2015, we generated pre-tax income of a little over $500,000 and adjusted EBITDA of close to $1 million on essentially the same revenue.</p>
<p>With that, overview, I will turn over the call to my partner, Mark Goldwasser. Goldie, over to you.</p>
<p><strong>Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Robert, and good morning to everyone. Let me start by giving you my perspective on the quarter. On one hand, it is frustrating to be successfully executing on our strategy to see some real operating improvement in the quarter, and not have that improvement flow to the bottom line because of non-recurring expenses. On the other hand, we know our true earnings potential is well above our reported numbers and we have a business model in place to drive profitability even higher.</p>
<p>I will now run through our business segments. Our core retail brokerage operations and extensive network of registered employee and independent brokers and advisors offers a broad range of financial products and services to retail and institutional clients. In the third quarter of 2015, revenues from commissions, transfer fees and clearing services totaled $26 million versus $30 million in the same period last year. Of the $4 million decline, commissions accounted for roughly $3.6 million with part of the drop related to lower year-over-year sales of alternative investments, and the remainder to weaker industry conditions versus the prior year. That said, alternative investment products continued to see improving sales as a result of the actions taken in our second quarter and are now at the strongest levels since last October.</p>
<p>In terms of our broker network expansion, the continuing dislocation amongst independent and small broker dealers is creating unprecedented opportunities for us to accelerate our plans to enlarge and grow our distribution network and drive top line growth and improve margins. Year-to-date, we have enjoyed a record recruiting season and our forward pipeline remains as robust as we’ve ever seen. It is an ideal environment for us and we’re proud to become known as destination of choice for so many high caliber brokers and advisors looking for a new home, particularly in the tri-state area. Year-to-date, we have added 51 registered reps and advisors with $19 million in trailing 12-month production who have expanded our assets under management by $956 million. These figures represent only strategic additions we’ve made at the corporate level. </p>
<p>Recruiting at our local branches has also been robust. As we move into the final quarter of our fiscal year, we now have an expanded and more productive distribution network through which to offer a larger set of [indiscernible] products. We’re very pleased with the high caliber of brokers and advisors we continue to attract and hire.</p>
<p>In our investment banking operations, a business that addresses the underserved capital needs of emerging growth companies, the strong deal pipeline we’ve built has produced solid offerings and execution. Revenue for the third quarter increased 21% to approximately $6.4 million, which was our strongest banking quarter ever. We participated in 19 transactions comprised of a mix of private, lead and co-managed deals. Of the public deals, two were in the healthcare space, one in technology, two in energy, two in industrials, three in service and five in diversified funds. During the quarter, we also raised capital for three private companies. I’m pleased to report that this business is off to a strong start in the fourth quarter. We were the sole lead manager of Aqua Metals’ successful IPO in July, a pivotal milestone for national securities, and our future banking pipeline remains robust and strong. </p>
<p>Moving on to trading, our principal transaction revenues in the third quarter of 2015 continued to contract, declining almost 40% to $2.4 million from the prior year’s level. Our low interest rate environment, reduced profile of large institutional principal investment business, and shrinkage of proprietary trading throughout the industry continued to negatively impact trading volumes for equities, municipals, and corporate debt and treasury bonds where our trading is highly concentrated. In our asset management business, we saw investment advisory fees decline slightly to $3.8 million versus the prior year period.</p>
<p>Lastly, our tax preparation and accounting business saw revenues climb 6.5% to $2.7 million versus the prior year’s level as we continue to steadily grow our client base and fees. Throughout the organization, we are actively taking steps to cut operating expenses further wherever possible and narrowly refine our necessary or excessive costs. Evidence of such efforts was seen in our communications, occupancy and other admin expenses, all of which declined in third quarter from prior levels. The bottom line is that we have a sound strategy in place and we’ll continue to execute against it. We’ll continue to expand our retail broker and advisor network, as well as our offerings of diverse products and services we distribute through that network. We’ll also drive improved profitability by reducing our overall cost base as we scale this platform.</p>
<p>I’ll now turn the call over to Glen Worman, who will provide some overview comments on our operations and financials. Glen?</p>
<p><strong>Glen Worman</strong></p>
<p>Thanks Goldie. Good morning everyone. I’ve been on board as Executive Vice President of Finance now for three months at this point, and I’d like to take a moment to share with you my observations since joining the company, what initiatives I’ll be working on, and the intended outcomes of these initiatives. </p>
<p>I joined the firm to support Goldie specifically to enhance our operations, streamline the production and reporting of our financials, and strengthen our corporate governance. Over the course of my career, I’ve been involved in the management at one time or another of nearly all of National’s business lines, and I’m bringing that wealth of experience and best practices knowledge to the firm. </p>
<p>For a financial services company of our size, National offers a broad set of businesses, employs a diverse business model, and has a talented executive management team. A good cost control mindset is already in place at the company, which should become more apparent as we move forward. Finally, National is well capitalized for its current business model and size, and these are impressive attributes upon which we can scale the business and we are well positioned for growth. The initiatives I plan to devote my efforts include business line growth and profitability, corporate governance, operating controls, and improved financial reporting and analysis, all with the goal of driving profitable growth for the company as a whole. </p>
<p>I’ll now take you through the financial results of our earnings, which will be filed on Form 10-Q with the SEC. For the June 30, 2015 quarter, we reported total revenues of $42.3 million, which represented a decline of 9% versus revenue of $46.6 million in the prior year’s quarter. The principal components of revenue in the current quarter is as follows: commissions and related fees of $26 million, investment banking $6.4 million, investment advisory $3.8 million, tax prep and accounting $2.7 million, principal transactions of $2.4 million, and interest and dividends and other income totaling $1 million. </p>
<p>On the expense side, costs declined in the quarter by 7% versus the prior year, with the most meaningful decline coming in the commissions, compensation and fees category which was down commensurate with revenue 7% to $35.8 million. We were also able to realize double-digit declines in our costs related to clearing fees and other administrative expenses and single-digit declines in our communications and occupancy expenses. Offsetting these declines was a 61% increase in professional fees to $1.7 million and a 15% increase in our license and registration expenses. As Robert stated, $800,000 of our expenses in the quarter were non-recurring.</p>
<p>Despite the declining year-over-year revenue and the inclusion of one-time expenses, we still reported operating income of roughly $400,000 for the current quarter. While this fell short of the $1.7 million reported in the quarter ended June 30, 2014, good expense management helped maintain profitability.</p>
<p>Net income was $149,000 or $0.01 per basic and diluted share for the quarter ended June 30, 2015 compared to net income of $1.7 million or $0.13 per basic and diluted share for the prior year quarter. Income in the third quarter of 2014 benefited from the recognition of tax credits which resulted in an effective tax rate of 1.7% in that period. Adjusted EBITDA, which is a non-GAAP measure, was $1 million for the third fiscal quarter of 2015 versus $2.3 million in the prior year’s quarter and $3 million for the first six months of 2015 versus $8.2 million in the previous year’s period.</p>
<p>Turning now to our balance sheet, as of June 30, 2015 we had cash and cash equivalents, which included receivables from our clearing firm and marketable securities of approximately $30.1 million or roughly 46% of our total assets as compared to $30.5 million or 47% of our total assets for the fiscal year ended September 30, 2014. The company’s total stockholders equity was $45.8 million or $3.68 per share, and represented a 3% increase when compared to the $44.5 million as of September 30, 2014. Lastly, our balance sheet remains debt-free.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll turn the call back to Robert.</p>
<p><strong>Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Glen. Obviously we would have liked to report stronger profit numbers for the quarter, but we know our underlying profitability was much more robust than that shown in our reported numbers and that we continue to be pointed in the right direction. Our business has remained steady throughout the quarter and continues to track that way as we move into the fourth quarter. Despite industry-wide commission and transaction headwinds, our core retail brokerage business remains robust, our distribution network continues to expand, our investment banking business continues to enjoy a steady and diversified deal flow, and our investment advisory and tax and accounting business remains solid.</p>
<p>In short, we find ourselves well positioned to capitalize on our strengths and deal with whatever uncertainties the economy and capital markets may have in store for us. We’re going to continue to explore opportunities to add scale to our business, opportunities which seem to repeatedly arise when firms combine and talented individuals and groups become available through either dissatisfaction or engagement, something we’re seeing in record numbers at this point in time. Because we’re known in the market for giving brokers and advisors a growing platform, both individuals and groups are attracted to National Holdings.</p>
<p>With that, I’m going to conclude my prepared remarks and turn it back to the operator for any questions you might have. Operator, back to you.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator instructions]</p>
<p>The first question comes from Gary Reib [ph] of Marco Consulting [ph]. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. I had a couple. I guess I’ll just start with the 51 reps you added. Were those net adds, and can you give us a sense just kind of what their business mix looks like? I know it was a good amount of revenue. Is there recurring with that they’re bringing over, or are they mostly transactional guys?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Gary, thank you for that question. I would say 70% of it is transactions, 30% is fees. Most of it is coming--really what’s interesting, it’s the best recruiting talent that I’ve seen in the 14 years I’ve been at National. It’s coming from a mix of different broker dealers, from wire houses, from small independents, and from small broker dealers that continue to feel the squeeze. I mean, one thing we know is that you’re under $100 million of revenues, it’s a struggle to survive in this environment, so we’re very pleased with our trailing calendar and our forward calendar is just as extensive as what we’ve hired. </p>
<p>Most of the recruiting has actually come in the last four months, so we haven’t seen the benefit of that. I would say 25% of these assets have transferred over to date.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Okay, that’s great. Are you losing guys too, or are those 51 mostly net?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>The 51 is mostly net. In our bigger branches and OSJs, there’s a constant churn of brokers, but those are basically junior, green, immaterial brokers to us as our branches are constantly upgrading.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>That makes complete sense. I guess my follow-up question on that is are you guys seeing a good opportunity in the marketplace from some of the turmoil at--</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Arcap?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Arcap, yeah. I was going to say American Realty, but it’s Arcap, specifically shutting down JP Turner, some of the consolidation at Cetera, that sort of stuff. I guess my follow-up is that are you having to write forgiveable notes to get people to come over, or do they just want to leave?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely we are--you know, I don’t want to get into too many details, but some of those advisors and reps have come from Arcap entities. Our recruiting, we try to limit the amount of cash. We use accelerated payouts, a combination of cash and accelerated payouts. We’re very frugal and very efficient, and we try to keep the breakeven on the hires between six and nine months.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Got it, okay. So you said the 51 doesn’t really incorporate too much of what you’re seeing, because it’s picked up over the last couple months, so that’s good.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>About 25% is up and running.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>There’s also phenomenon, Gary, which is where smaller firms that are going out of business choose to direct their brokers through a deal they’ve made to another firm, and very often--in one case, we saw one firm where more than 90% of the brokers chose not to affiliate with the new firm because they were transactionally based brokers and these were fee-based firms, and it didn’t fit. All of a sudden, a large number of offices and individuals become available in the marketplace, and Goldie and his team have been successful in recent weeks and recent months in bringing a number of those people on board as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Yes, so I guess my other follow-up question is on the M&amp;A environment. I know a lot of these guys are dissolving, but is there an opportunity for you guys to go before they dissolve and say, listen, this isn’t worth anything to you guys, we can write you a half million, a million-dollar check and just take this off your hands?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. I think you’ve got a very good read for the market, Gary. It’s all true, all real and I think dissolving is the right word for small broker dealers. But there are also larger broker dealers that haven’t dissolved yet, that are looking to do something strategically. So it’s the most fertile market opportunity I’ve seen and a lot of low-hanging fruit all over.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Right, that makes sense. I guess to tie in the cash, then, since you have a significant amount of cash, I know you announced a repurchase. How do you guys plan to execute on that, because there is restrictions around trading volume and that sort of thing. Have you guys considered just doing a tender?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>No, actually we haven’t considered doing a tender. Our thought process is to execute this over time, and share repurchases, they tend to add some tone and liquidity to the market, and opportunistically with an equity book value in the $3.68 area with the stock trading lower than that, we’re going to take an opportunistic entry into the market where we see it would be beneficial. But we are not planning to react to blocks, we are planning to enter the market periodically and with a greater consistency over time. </p>
<p>We did discuss other methods of returning value to shareholders, such as cash dividends, and chose not to do that at this time. But if we continue to accrete cash, anything becomes a possibility, including a combination of the two.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Got it. Just for our purposes, how much of the cash is--you know, you’ve got a fair amount of cash on the balance sheet. How much of that would you guys consider excess? I know you need some for regulatory capital, some is offset with commissions that are payable and that sort of thing. Is there an amount that’s considered to be excess that you guys have for M&amp;A or purchases, whatever?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Yes, very conservatively speaking, I’d put that number at about $12 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Okay, perfect. I’ll jump out and let some other people ask some questions. Thanks guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Gary.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. The next question comes from Robert Strougo of RIS Investments. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Strougo</strong></p>
<p>Gentlemen, you mentioned it’s a highly competitive environment. You’re not exactly the biggest company in the field there. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Robert, it’s tough to hear you. Could you come a little closer to the phone?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Strougo</strong></p>
<p>Okay, can you hear me now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>That’s better.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Strougo</strong></p>
<p>Okay. Companies like Ladenburg Thalmann have been mentioned - you have executives who used to be with the company - as a potential merger. The insiders have a lot of stock, you’re buying back some, you’re tremendously undervalued, there have been reports issued recently indicating how undervalued you are and what a good acquisition candidate you might be to another brokerage house. It seems to me in you’re in a highly competitive business with a lot of pitfalls, companies going out of business. Again, you’re not the biggest company in the field. Have we considered, or will we consider the possibility of merging with another company, or what kind of tax loss carry forwards do we have in the event that we sell some of our assets to another company?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>We do have tax loss carry forwards that could be available under certain transactions, but it’d have to be carefully constructed so that they’re neither depreciated or they’re not lost. As a public company, we welcome any interest from the outside that might lead to increased shareholder value. Speaking for myself as a larger shareholder in the company, nothing would please me more than seeing a premium bidder come in and find us attractive, either as a merger or consolidation, that led to higher shareholder value for all of us. But we don’t hang out the For Sale sign because it has such a disruptive effect on business, that we regard ourselves as a public company that reacts to responsible market overtures when, as and if they appear, as well as on the other side as we are constantly looking at opportunities to grow incrementally, as Goldie spoke about - you know, one, two, five, 10 brokers at a time, or whether there are opportunities on a greater scale that are within the scope of our ability to handle and merge, where we could grow the company sequentially at a faster pace that might present themselves. So we are constantly, constantly thinking of this and reacting to anything that may come our way.</p>
<p>I mean, the good news as a shareholder is you have shareholders on your board who are two of the largest shareholders in the company and certainly have common interest with you as an individual holder in seeing stock price and stock value accrete as much as possible.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Strougo</strong></p>
<p>Well, we’d love to see it accrete, but unfortunately it hasn’t been doing that of the last several years, so we’d like to see some results, whether it be a dividend or buyback or substantial appreciation of the stock.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Well, we announced the buyback, which we think shows positive confidence in the company about continued profitability, and the loan is to return some cash to its shareholders. As time goes on, if things continue the way they are, I’m sure we’ll start considering other issues as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Robert Strougo</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. The next question comes from Artem Fokin of Caro-Kann Capital. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Artem Fokin</strong></p>
<p>Hello guys. Thank you for taking my question. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Is it Artum - A-R-T-U-M?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Artem Fokin</strong></p>
<p>Yes, A-R-T-E-M. So I believe that the standstill agreement which you guys entered into about a year ago with the [indiscernible] expires around the shareholder meeting this year. Could you remind us, just to refresh everyone’s memory, those who have been in the stock at the time and those who are relatively new to the story, what does it mean in terms of [indiscernible] will be lifted.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Artem, I guess we’re not quite sure what it is you’re talking about.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>We don’t understand the question. If you could just repeat it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Artem Fokin</strong></p>
<p>Sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Are you talking about the agreement whereby two members of the management of Iroquois joined our board?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Artem Fokin</strong></p>
<p>That’s correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Well, the practical effect is they joined our board, they are active and participating members of the board, are part and parcel of the decision-making process, so unless that situation were to change and they were to want to leave the board and change their posture, there is no practical effect or consequence to date at this point in time. It’s simply a matter of whether or not as members of the board, they are satisfied with what their ability to influence events is having and whether or not they wanted to change that. But that’s not up to us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Artem Fokin</strong></p>
<p>Let me rephrase my question in that case - and by the way, thank you taking a first crack at that. As I understood, when those gentlemen joined the board, they took upon themselves probably certain limitations in their behavior, such as not to engage in proxy battles, [indiscernible], et cetera, and I was under the impression those limitations will expire, I guess sometime next week when you guys will hold the shareholder meeting in New York. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>There are certain aspects of it that carry through to the next annual meeting.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Artem Fokin</strong></p>
<p>Meaning the next meeting which will happen in August 2015, or sometime in 2016?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>I believe there is some of both in terms of how it works with their board membership and the expiration of their board terms, and that would depend on whether or not they chose to remain on the board or whether or not they chose to resign from the board, and whether or not their shareholdings dropped beneath a certain level, which has certain triggering events. I don’t have it in front of me, so I can’t give you the exact detail.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>But we can get back--we’ll get hold of you and come back to you with the exact details, Artem.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Artem Fokin</strong></p>
<p>That would be helpful, thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Okay, thank you. Operator?</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, if there are any additional questions, please press star, one at this time.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>I think Gary wants to ask another question. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Yes, the next question comes from Gary Reib of Marco Consulting. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I just had one follow-up, just on the DOL and where you guys see that, and how you guys see that affecting your business. I know it’s really fluid and I know that it’s subject to a lot of change, but it’s one of those that people are really wringing their hands over. I know that there is a number of exemptions that they’re talking about, and I think those are expanding. I was just wondering if maybe you guys could comment on that and help us just kind of understand how it affects--how you guys expect it to affect your business, if and when it--</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Gary, I’ll take that question. I’m involved in a [indiscernible] committee, there is actually a significant meeting next week. There a lot of confusion - Rick Ketchum has come out against the DOL, Jeb Hensarling from the Financial Services Committee has many, many issues and problems, so unfortunately it’s a political football and depending how the politics goes. I would say that the DOL issue is a dark cloud for the industry as a whole. For us, though, I would say there’s an opportunity because--and I don’t have the analysis in front of me, but if you call me, relative to our peers, our retirement account business is significantly lower than most of the traditional independents. Our banking business is driven at the moment by a mix of institutional and accredited and super-credit investors and we don’t think the DOL business will be impacting that business. </p>
<p>Obviously we need to grow our RIA and make sure we have more recurring revenues. We tend to be low in that area, so our strategy is to, one, grow the RIA business, and I think the DOL issue will actually be an opportunity for us on a relative basis to our peers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Hm, okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Gary, if you want to call me, I can go into more significant detail, because I don’t have the spreadsheet in front of me.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Yes, I may pick up the phone and give you a call. Thanks a lot, guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Mark Goldwasser</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Gary.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Gary Reib</strong></p>
<p>Take care.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Operator, any further questions at this time?</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>There are no further questions at this time. Please continue.</p>
<p><strong>A - Robert Fagenson</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. So thank you all for joining us today and taking the time. We appreciate your continuing interest in National Holdings. We are as disappointed as anyone could be in terms of the lack of reflection of the company’s progress over the last year as being a component of the stock price. If you take a look at this company today in terms of business diversification and ability to produce positive EBITDA, even under very difficult circumstances and even in the face of extraordinary charges, we don’t think it’s being reflected in the stock price, but we aren’t the market, we’re observers to the market. We will continue to do what we can as a company to move forward and do all the right things that we can, and hopefully over time it will be reflected in a share price that we feel more equates to what the value of the company is. </p>
<p>We look forward to speaking to you again when we report our fourth quarter results and conduct our next earnings conference call in early December. Once again, thank you all, and thanks to my colleagues here.</p>
<p>Operator, that concludes the call.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude the conference call for today. You may now disconnect your line and have a great day.</p>
