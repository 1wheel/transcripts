<p>We will start with Johannes Teyssen, who will give you an update regarding the progress of our spinoff process, as well as our major new-build projects before speaking about the regulatory and political developments in the last couple of months. Afterwards, Michael Sen will guide you through our half year results. The remaining time is reserved for your questions.</p>
<p>Johannes, over to you.</p>
<p><strong>Johannes Teyssen</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Anke. Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, also from me. Welcome to our first half 2015 conference call.</p>
<p>Before I start my presentation, I’d like to introduce and warmly welcome our new CFO, Michael Sen. Michael joined us in June from Siemens. He worked there for almost 30 years and comes with an impressive track record. He held a broad variety of management roles in both operations and strategy. These include being responsible for international portfolio strategies at Siemens corporate development and which is important for he as serving as Head of Investor Relations. In his most recent role, he worked for more than six years as CFO of Siemens Healthcare, a business which roughly employs 43,000 people worldwide. Within this business, Michael was the driving force for significant efficiency enhancements and portfolio streamlining. He earned himself rightfully the reputation of putting a very strong focus on capital efficiency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, he gained firsthand experience at Siemens in carving out major businesses and preparing them for public listing. I’m thus delighted to have him on board. Within E.ON, we are happy that we can profit from his broader experiences. I look very much forward to working together with him and making the implementation of our strategy a big success for all stakeholders.</p>
<p>In addition, I’d like to take the opportunity to congratulate our former CFO, Klaus Schäfer for the designation to become the CEO of Uniper. I thank Klaus for his outstanding job as CFO. Furthermore, I’m convinced that with his strong background, particularly in Uniper’s core businesses, he is best suited for this position.</p>
<p>Finally, dear analysts and investors, I’d like to thank you very much for the high participation rate in our recent investor study. Your feedback was very much appreciated, and it will feed into our further work as a really helpful input for internal work to set up the two new companies.</p>
<p>With this, I’m moving to chart one. Let’s now move on to the results of the first half of 2015. As expected, EBITDA was down roughly 13% and reached €4.3 billion. The decline is largely driven by lower achieved prices in power and oil, the weak ruble, as well disposal effects. The positive effects we envisage from the finalization of several large projects are all geared towards the second half of this year and will become thus more prominent the following quarters. Underlying net income came out at €1.2 billion.</p>
<p>With regards to the full year outlook, we are well underway to reach our earnings targets. Thus, we keep the full year 2015 outlook unchanged. We continue to expect EBITDA to come out between €7 billion and €7.6 billion and underlying net income between €1.4 billion and €1.8 billion. Furthermore, we confirm our commitment to pay a dividend of €0.50 a share for the year 2015. Michael will detail the results in a moment. Before he does so, I would like to first update you on the spinoff preparation; secondly highlight the progress of our major projects in renewables, Russia and conventional generation; and finally discuss recent regulatory and political developments.</p>
<p>Chart two: Ever since we announced our decision to separate our group into two distinctively focused companies, we have heard from quite a number of investors that they think our spinoff execution process just takes too long. To provide a better understanding for the necessary length of the process time line, I would like to give you a look into the engine room of the project which we call One2Two.</p>
<p>For this measure, I reemphasize that the whole split process is not about spinning off a relatively small and already existing subsidiary which leaves the rest of the group largely unaffected, it is rather about creating two completely new companies, which implies essentially a full restructuring, in large part the whole group. Technically, we perform this task by creating Uniper. Its respective assets and activities will be cast out from a variety of E.ON’s current setups. This involves a very substantial amount of legal and organizational restructuring as well as a lot of redesigning of operational processes and sometimes even relocations. The carve-out work stream of the One2Two project identified in the diagnostic phase until April; more than 4,000 individual aspects that have to be taken care of in this carve-out phase. According to our external advisors, this is still in the normal range but typical for such a complex operation.</p>
<p>The team from the carve-out work stream translated the listed issues into a very concrete and specific implementation plan. Today, the roll-out of this plan to operationally separate the two companies is in full swing and roughly one-third of the more than 400,000 milestones are already achieved. To make the already achieved progress more tangible for you, I’d like to highlight some of the key achievements so far.</p>
<p>We allocated all of E.ON’s roughly 1,300 legal entities to either Uniper or future E.ON. Furthermore, we finalized the new organizational structures for both companies and agreed this co-determination. These structures were the necessary preconditions to appoint besides the new two top management teams, the roughly 350 executives for future E.ON and Uniper, and all have been named by now to new roles. And we expect all our employees to be allocated to the two companies by the mid of November.</p>
<p>As E.ON Global Commodities shall be part of Uniper, the setting up of the new function, E.ON, energy management, has started. The new function shall procure energy and market future E.ON’s renewables output. It shall cooperate very closely with the local sales teams. To provide procurement and marketing services and capabilities locally, new teams shall be established in Germany, Sweden and the UK. They shall be managed centrally across the regions from Essen. Their main task shall be to provide market access, spot optimization, as well as dispatch. It will however not be a new trading house; it will be clearly small and functional.</p>
<p>Let us move on to the overall project timeline and the key milestones, a chart which all of you have become quite familiar with, on chart three. Drawing conclusions from my words on our achieved progress, I can reassure you today that our internal preparation for one of the world’s largest spinoffs in the energy business is well on track, and that future E.ON and Uniper shall be operationally separated from January 1, 2016 onwards. In 2016, the focus of our project will then shift from a carve-out phase towards a spinoff, in a transaction sense. Of course, also the transaction work stream within One2Two is in full swing already and we have, for example started to draft a prospectus for Uniper’s listing. From the day of the announcement of the spinoff back in December last year, we made very clear that we intend to fully divest our remaining minority share in Uniper step wise over the medium-term. However, this divestment process shall not start before the beginning of 2018. This is due to a number of reasons. Besides capital market considerations, we are also to take into account some tax related measures.</p>
<p>By initially spinning off a majority of Uniper only and holding our remaining shares at least until the end of 2017, which will be one, one and a half years, we should be able to limit additional tax burdens in relation to past restructuring measures. However, these assessments do need to be confirmed by binding tax rulings that we applied for. All in all, we regard our time line as ambitious but achievable. Nevertheless, we are also dependent on external bodies, like for example, tax authorities for binding tax rulings or the spinoff auditor nominated by local courts. I am deeply convinced that the progress achieved so far on the spinoff preparation demonstrates the extraordinary professionalism of the E.ON organization and its personnel.</p>
<p>In this time of significant change for E.ON, it is more important than ever to concentrate on improving and further developing our businesses. This is why I would like to update you in the next chart of progress in first and foremost, our renewable business. I am pleased to inform you that our offshore wind farm, Humber Gateway, in the British North Sea, is by now very close to be fully commissioned. We expect the final commissioning to take place in the next months. The project with an in-store capacity of 219 megawatts will be completed two months ahead of schedule and below budget. Construction began in 2012 and the first of 73 turbines came online in February of this year.</p>
<p>Also, and even more challenging, our Amrumbank West project, 288 megawatt offshore in the German North Sea is progressing very well and is on track to be commissioned in autumn this year. So far, close to 90% of the 80 turbines have been already installed and more than 50% of all of them have already been fully commissioned. The farm is thus connected to the grid and the production of electricity has started in April this year.</p>
<p>The simultaneous delivery of two large scale offshore projects in different countries in time and budget is evidence for E.ON’s exceptional offshore wind capabilities. Therefore, we intend to further strengthen our position as a leading offshore wind company.</p>
<p>In May, we confirmed our investment decision for the Rampion offshore wind farm in the UK. This development will have an installed capacity of even 400 megawatts and comprise 116 wind turbines. The total investment is approximately £1.3 billion. The UK Green Investment Bank has acquired a 25% stake in the project early on and does co-finance it. We do not exclude to involve a further partner in this attractive project. Commissioning is planned and secured for 2018.</p>
<p>In June, the development phase for the Arkona offshore wind project in the German Baltic Sea, which would have a maximum installed capacity of 385 megawatts, reached an important milestone. The nearby port of Sassnitz was selected as logistic base during construction and its future operation center. However, we there have not yet taken a final investment decision yet.</p>
<p>These four projects demonstrate in an exemplary way, our continued growth ambitions in the renewable area. To give you even more insight on our strong track record in the renewable business in recent years, we intend to hold a so called business deep-dive event, similar to the one we did for our distribution network some time ago. You will receive the invitation in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>I move now, on the next, chart five, which shows the current status of our new-build projects on the conventional side, Beresovskaya and Maasvlakte. After several years of extremely hard work, these projects are coming very close to their finalization. The principal construction work on our 800-megawatt lignite plant, Beresovskaya were completed in May, as expected. However, the commissioning works and the administration register of all these works required slightly more time than anticipated.</p>
<p>We have already received the permission to connect the equipment to the grid, one of the most important final milestones. Currently, we are performing the necessary comprehensive final test runs. The commissioning is now expected to be finalized in this month and to take effect in September. On a full year basis, this plant will contribute roughly 50 billion ruble to our ongoing EBITDA, pay out roughly 90% year capacity payments. The plant has very low fuel costs as a major share of the necessary lignite delivered to the plant via two 14-kilometer long open conveyor belts directly from the nearby lignite deposit.</p>
<p>The highly efficient 1,100 megawatt hard coal plant in Maasvlakte in the port of Rotterdam is running continuously already since March. In the meantime, testing and optimizing activities have been completed. The flexibility of this plant is state of the art and allows load changes of more than 50 megawatts per minute. The official and final commissioning procedure is underway, and we currently expect the formal commissioning to take place in October. I would like to emphasize that these two plants highlight in an exemplary way that Uniper will have quite a number of brand new assets which will require only very limited maintenance CapEx.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have with the exception of Datteln 4, no more growth project going forward. Those aspects together, limited maintenance CapEx and currently limited investment needs in conventional generation are supportive for the free cash flow generation of Uniper. Therefore, I would like to take the opportunity to reassure you on the point that Uniper will have a strong development focus.</p>
<p>With chart six, we are moving on to regulatory and political developments over the recent months.</p>
<p>Although we currently regard the market environment as unattractive for investments in conventional generation, we observe continued progress in the development of the regulatory framework, albeit very slowly. Let me start with an overview of recent developments in the policy area in which we observe the most progress, the European Emissions Trading Scheme. In July, the Council, European Parliament Commission agreed on the implementation of the market stability reserve, as we had already anticipated back in March. The back-loaded allowances of 900 million tons and the still unallocated allowances of the first rounds of probably 500 million to 600 million tons will be placed into the reserve, reducing the surplus of allowances. The MSR will start in Jan 2019.</p>
<p>The introduction of the MSR will help to restore to a certain extent the signaling function of the CO2 price for the European climate policy. With forward prices reaching levels of around €8 per ton, coming from levels below €4 roughly two years ago, there are at least first signs that this has started to materialize. Going forward, we expect the policy discussions on the ETS will shift to a longer-term reform of the scheme and a more supportive one.</p>
<p>Looking at the ongoing energy reform discussions in Germany however, progress is less clear cut. In July, the government published cornerstones for the energy policy going forward. And also, the long awaited White Book on the German power market was published. Overall, the White Book is directionally supportive. We are welcoming the foreseen removal of implicit price caps and the intention to improve the remuneration for plants operating under the reserved plant ordinance. The latter should be helpful for our high efficient gas plants in Irsching in Bavaria.</p>
<p>We hope that improved remuneration rules will make it possible to find an economic solution that would avoid the announced closure, by allowing an adequate profitability for the plant from next year onward. However, the planned introduction of a capacity reserve instead of a full-fledged capacity market is not far reaching enough to create a sustainable environment, and to remunerate security supply in an adequate manner. From our perspective, such an instrument can only be an intermediate step. At this point, I would like to reiterate my conviction that full-fledged capacity markets, like for example in the UK, will be necessary for Germany in the coming years.</p>
<p>Last but not least, I would like to come to the topic of nuclear provision. The government has announced the following approach to deal with the topic of ensuring the long-term financeability of the nuclear asset retirement obligations. One element is the already running so called, stress test. On behalf of the Ministry of Economy, the German accounting firm Warth &amp; Klein Grant Thornton is currently assessing whether the nuclear provisions have been calculated in a correct way in terms of accounting rules. This assessment is based on the existing underlying technical cost estimates. Results should be finalized by the end of September.</p>
<p>We are convinced that our nuclear provisions are fully adequate. There’s probably no other balance sheet item that has received more intense scrutiny from independent auditors than nuclear provisions. And international comparisons show that nuclear provisions in Germany are among the highest in the world. As the next step, the commission shall, based on the results of the stress test, develop recommendations by the end of November for potential further action. This recommendation shall take into account that the financial strength of the nuclear operators stays fully intact, a new and clear message of the government.</p>
<p>From our perspective, the commission shows this nuclear decommissioning, final waste storage and the numerous related issues in a comprehensive way. This new and whole process offers the big opportunity that a consensual solution between the government and nuclear operators can be achieved. We are thus absolutely open and supportive for discussions and joint solutions. However, in the last weeks we had to take note of a newly emerging uncertainty around the topic. To give you some examples, Minister Gabriel talked publicly about parents are liable for their kids or the leading German newspaper, Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung published an article with the headline, “government brings up the SK book for nuclear operators.” Furthermore, the government announced in this ministry that it’s currently worked on a draft law that shall foresee an almost unlimited liability for nuclear decommissioning and final waste storage charges.</p>
<p>The announced law sounds like making the second step before first one has been done. We think the government should wait first for the results from its own commission and the stress test before jumping to conclusions. We have to ask ourselves what all of this could potentially mean for us. We thus seek an exchange with the government with the aim to overcome concerns, clear up potential misunderstandings and have an open and constructive dialog. Once we have assessed the new situation and have more visibility, we will then come back to you.</p>
<p>At this point, I want to clearly reemphasize that our new strategy at its heart was never meant to be a reply to the ongoing nuclear debate in Germany. Thus, a lot of the media comments are not based on facts. We made it always very clear that we intend to set up Uniper in a way as E.ON is today that it will be perfectly capable of delivering on its nuclear asset retirement obligations with a sound investment-grade rating. But most importantly, let me assure you very clearly one thing. The board and I, together with the whole of E.ON are fully committed to our strategy. We want and will increase our business focus as a response to a fundamentally altered market environment. And our way to achieve this is to divide our portfolio into two separate companies with very distinct identities. Uniper at its core shall have an ongoing and future oriented commodity and system focus, targeting the conventional energy world for the decades to come. We see here a very long term and sustainable future as a crucial provided of security of supply.</p>
<p>The core of future E.ON and its future businesses shows focus on the customer in the new energy world and concentrate on renewables networks and the customer solutions, and we will deliver on that.</p>
<p>With these remarks, I would like to come to the final chart seven where we show you the three key takeaways of my short presentation. Firstly, the execution of the spinoff preparation is complex, lengthy but well on track. And many important milestones have been achieved. We respect the challenges from a lot of you but you can be assured that we do our utmost with hundreds of people working day and night. Secondly, we are finalizing important projects and entering the harvesting phase now on the renewable and the conventional side in the second half of this year. And finally, we are working on future, further organic growth opportunities for the future of E.ON.</p>
<p>Thank you for your attention. And before we come to your questions, Michael, over to you and the numbers of the first half.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Sen</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thank you, Johannes for your kind introduction, and a warm welcome also from my side. I’ve been with E.ON since June 1st but it actually feels much longer than six weeks only. It was just like jumping on an accelerated high speed train. And I had to get into matters very deeply and quickly, especially concerning the transaction. I will share a few of my first impressions with you, towards the end of my presentation.</p>
<p>As Johannes mentioned, I’ve had a lot of touch points and experience with financial markets, interacting with the sell side and of course with investors who are the owner of our company. For me, good relations with financial markets, equity and debt alike need to build on transparency and performance. Being clear on value propositions, transparent on value drivers and following up on guidance and commitments is essential. Hence, I am looking forward to having deeper discussions with you in the future.</p>
<p>Let me start by giving you some color on the development of our earnings, cash flow and debt position in the first half of fiscal 2015. It goes without saying that we are still operating in a challenging business and regulatory environment, stressed oil markets, most European power markets still at over 10-year lows, more and more renewable being fed into the system. In this challenging environment, earnings in terms of EBITDA and underlying net income, both came in according to expectations. Strong cash flow and a seasonally high cash conversion stand out for the first half of fiscal 2015. And looking at our balance sheet, net debt levels improved quite a bit. In light of this, I’d characterize the first half as solid. Further, we are confirming our 2015 full year guidance even as the macro business and regulatory environment continues to evolve.</p>
<p>Our EBITDA for the first half came in at €4.3 billion, which is a decline of roughly €650 million or 13% versus $4.9 billion at prior year’s half. For your reference, the €4.9 billion in H1 2014 reflects the reclassification of our Spanish and Italian businesses into discontinued operations.</p>
<p>You may remember from our first quarter reporting that we have moved E.ON Energy sales, the sales business dealing with power and gas wholesale from E.ON Germany to Global Commodities. Hence, we have also pro forma adjusted the two segmental EBITDAs of the affected units. Global Commodities EBITDA for H1 2014 was consequently €63 million higher with the same amount negatively impacting the EBITDA of the reporting segment Germany. By year-end, this adjustment will grow to €85 million which obviously was the earnings contribution of E.ON Energy sales in 2014.</p>
<p>Now, let me walk you through the main parts, driving the change year over year. In fact, the EBITDA waterfall depicts a pretty representative picture of the business dynamics throughout the group at this stage of the year.</p>
<p>Germany delivered some earnings expansion, mainly on the back of the non-regulated part of the business. We’ve been seeing partly pricing driven improvements of the gross margin as well as weather normalization come into play. The next large positive effect which we had guided towards in March was related to new capacities coming on line across three different segments. Johannes has already elaborated on this. For 2015, we continue to expect an up to €0.3 billion positive year-over-year change from Maasvlakte, Beresovskaya and the two offshore wind projects. Yet up until now, the effect has not been material enough to make it into this reconciliation.</p>
<p>Equally to when we have been reporting on Q1, the overall pattern has not changed. That means we clearly experience more volatility to the downside. Therefore, it does not come as a surprise I guess also not to the Street, that we expect a significantly lower EBITDA development year over year for the full fiscal. The largest drag of about €300 million is obviously the power price and volume effect. This was also the main argument when giving our 2015 outlook.</p>
<p>Back then, as well as now for the first six months in essence, you can group these two effects in two buckets. First, the lower achieved prices for our nuclear and hydro generation, which account for more than half of the effect at the half. Remember, the achieved prices for power in Central Europe as well as the Nordic market are down some €6 per megawatt hour. Second, lower volumes in our nuclear generation in Sweden as well as Germany. In Germany the Grafenrheinfeld stretch-out operation is taking its toll already in H1, but in light of the final shutdown late June the volume impact from this will, of course, be more pronounced in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>At our E&amp;P business, we also saw a €100 million decline compared to the first half of 2014. In March, Klaus had been guiding to a roughly €300 million to €500 million full-year contraction. Current run rate would suggest some easing. Why, because the U.S. dollar and the UK pound development year-over-year is supportive and the business has better than expected volumes. Hence, both effects partly compensate for the lower oil prices in our North Sea production and lower BAFA prices in our Russian field, Yuzhno Russkoye. Obviously, we will update you on this as we go along.</p>
<p>€100 million disposal effect relates to our divestiture of the Spanish generation activities, thermo, hydro and renewables to Macquarie and Wren House with the effect to the end of Q1. Whilst this just explains the fallen away earnings contribution from the regional business is already reflected in prior year’s EBITDA via the treatment as discontinued operations, the renewable and conventional generation activities have left the company with effect for the second quarter. Please be aware that due to a very high share of earnings last year and the conventional generation fleet in Spain in the isolated Q2, this effect should not be extrapolated for the full year.</p>
<p>In terms of what’s happening in line item other, let me point out the most important ones. As I already mentioned at the beginning of the reconciliation, there are only two segments at half year 2015 with positive earnings growth. The second one next to Germany is Global Commodities. Here we have been able to make use of our optimization potential in gas sourcing, also thanks to the more volatile winter environment. This effect represents €0.1 billion year-over-year improvement and is rather a one-off in its character.</p>
<p>In our non-EU segment, the improvement in our Turkish operation in Adisa was more than offset by lower earnings from Russia. There, the main driver was the weak ruble and also operational effects such as the fire in Surgutskaya power plant. All in all, this segment was down €100 million versus H1 2014.</p>
<p>The renewables business saw some tough comps as Q1 last year benefited from €100 million booking -- north of €100 million booking on the disposal of our offshore wind farm, Rodsand. This was partly offset in the wind, solar and other sub-segment by new capacities and favorable FX. Remember, a large share of our wind, solar and other renewables production is based in the US and in the UK.</p>
<p>We also saw lower earnings in our Group Management/Consolidation line driven by several effects of largely one-off character. We’ll probably not make good on this in the second half, so that the full year trend suggests we will probably be looking for a higher amount than in 2014.</p>
<p>And finally, we had two effects related to our Italian generation portfolio; one is related to prior-year provision releases for hydro concessions in relation to the CCGT fleet. This was not repeated and represents a low to mid-double-digit million euro effect. Of similar size is the non-extension of a special balancing power agreement with the Fiume Santo plant on the island of Sardinia which negatively impacted our H1 2015 earnings.</p>
<p>Now, let me shed some light on the items below the line, leading to underlying net income. Basically the contraction year-over-year in EBITDA of €650 million did not entirely drop through. Net income on an underlying basis was €1.2 billion, hence down by €300 million or 21% at the half, mainly on the back of year-over-year improvements in all line items. Again, you should be aware that all numbers on this chart reflect the pro forma adjustment for the discontinued operations in Spain and Italy. For the underlying net income, the pro forma adjustment amounted to €49 million.</p>
<p>So, what buffered the EBITDA drop? Lower deprecation by roughly €100 million year-over-year to €1.6 billion, stemming from a number of factors. Firstly, the assets held for sale accounting treatment of the Italian generation assets; secondly, last year’s large impairments reducing the asset base; and finally, the deconsolidation of the Spanish generation assets effective as per quarter -- the second quarter. The relief from lower E&amp;P depreciation driven by lower volumes we had guided for with respect to the full year is not fully materializing as volumes are actually holding up quite nicely in that arena. With respect to the full year, we are becoming more optimistic, pertaining to the volume development in light of the current good run rate.</p>
<p>Economic interest expense improved by roughly €100 million to €800 million. You might remember that in Q1, we had explained to you the relatively high negative result, respectively the year-over-year compression. Now with respect to Q2, we are looking at a relatively low isolated quarter both are related to the same group of effects. While in Q1 record low interest rates forced us to revalue our other long-term provisions, this effect reversed in Q2.</p>
<p>The tax rate of around 27% is at the same level of last year, broadly in line with our indication from full-year reporting. Applied on a reduced pretax profit, this obviously leads to a lower tax number in the neighborhood of around €100 million. Hence, the reported tax rate continues to be in line with our guidance range for the full year of 25% to 30% that it is not on the lower end of the range, to some extent has to do with the diverging earnings situation at E&amp;P. In the minority position, we usually have a strong seasonality towards the first half, in line with a strong first half seasonality of net income.</p>
<p>While it is nice to explain book earnings, cash usually is king. Reconciling EBITDA to operating cash flow depicts the cash conversion rate, a metric I’m used to out of the capital goods arena which probably will also play a crucial role going forward.</p>
<p>Non-cash effective EBITDA items during the period amounted to €1 billion. To a large extent, these consist of net provision additions. Among these, most prominent elements are provisions for CO2, needed for a fossil fleet; provisions for ROCs; pension provisions; and provisions for personnel expenses; and several other operational provisions. Most of these are part of our regular course of business, recurrent in nature and are to a similar extent, utilized on a recurrent basis, which brings me to the next point, the utilization of provisions which amounted to €1.2 billion over the period. The elements of dispositions are very similar to the constituents of the prior one, i.e. they are somewhat recurring and connected to our normal course of business.</p>
<p>In addition, the utilization of our nuclear provisions comes to play here, which is structurally the reason that disposition is higher. The €500 million net positive resulting from working capital movement is essentially driven by our Global Commodities business and is of somewhat seasonal character, for example due to the utilization of our gas storage and hence the connected inventory reduction. To this we do expect a compensating effect during the summer months when we refill the storages. For the first half, this is a somewhat decent cash conversion, even taking into account the seasonality at Global Commodities. Still, it is not advisable to take this as an indication for the full year 2015, as we will see some material inventory buildup in the second course of the year. However, we are currently faring well within our range of 60% to 70% cash conversion expectation for the full year.</p>
<p>Looking at our balance sheet, our economic net debt has been improving quite a bit in the course of the first six months. A strong cash balance, together with the proceeds from disposals has been driving the reduction of our net financial position. Economic net debt went down 4.1 billion, also having seen some significant relief coming from the pension provisions due to higher benchmark yields.</p>
<p>Let me run you through the key factors. As mentioned, cash balance was seasonally strong, amounting to €1.9 billion. Converting EBITDA with a rate of 99%, into an operating cash flow of €4.2 billion, covered for more than the payout on CapEx and dividends, ultimately yielding into a cash balance of €1.9 billion. For your reference, we paid our dividend of 50% per share in June, delivering on our commitment from December last year. The €0.8 billion in this reconciliation is the sum of our dividends flowing to minority shareholders and the cash component of the E.ON Group dividend. Please be reminded that disposition in cash terms is lower than the gross dividend number. This could lead to conclude that we again had an impressive pick-up of 30% -- 37% scrip dividend. Our cash effective CapEx are following the same seasonality as usual, hence they are more geared to the second half of the year. Half year CapEx was almost stable compared to last year’s level at €1.6 billion. 31% of this figure were invested in our renewables business and €1.1 billion i.e., almost 70% of the CapEx was dedicated to businesses that have been earmarked to constitute the core of future E.ON businesses.</p>
<p>Disposal proceeds have also helped us in the first half. The €2.4 billion of divestments is mainly, i.e., 80% attributable to our disposal of the Spanish activities, as well the Italian solar business. The bulk of the remainder is related to the sale of our remaining stake in the E.ON Energy from waste business. The €1.4 billion other, as usual summarizes the long list of different effects such as funding of the German and UK CTA, a change of Swedish nuclear provisioning, several FX effects, increased finance leases, and many more.</p>
<p>The pension obligation came down by €1.2 billion compared to year-end 2014. The lion’s share of this improvement can be attributed to the application of a higher discount rate for the German provisions of about 50 base points due to higher benchmark bond yields. Compared to quarter one 2015, reporting the effect is much more pronounced at over €2 billion, as discount rates for German pensions came down by 100 base points and also the discount rate for UK pensions edged up 40 base points.</p>
<p>In terms of an outlook for the remaining year, well it’s tough to make forecasts. So, let me stay with the facts and what we can somehow influence. The cash conversion of the second half tends to be much weaker, as already explained. Since it is a ratio on a seasonally driven smaller half year EBITDA and an inventory buildup, the operating cash flow we can expect to add to the H1 figure would not be substantially higher than €1 billion. [Ph]</p>
<p>With regards to CapEx, we still have over €2.5 billion left to reach our full year guidance. So the simple math leaves the figure of around €1.5 billion that we would have to generate from other sources in order to keep the net financial position, broadly flat at H1 levels. While last week we announced the disposal of our Italian hydro activities, the total cash in from all our Italian assets which we have sold will be north of €1 billion by year-end and this will probably help.</p>
<p>With the first half behind us, today, we are confirming our outlook ranges for EBITDA, at €7 billion to €7.6 billion; and underlying net income at €1.4 billion to €1.8 billion. We still feel well-positioned within these ranges. Within the EBITDA outlook range, some risks do exist. One of the risks we had throughout the year has by now materialized; the slight COD delay of the Beresovskaya plant. On the other hand, I already elaborated on our North Sea E&amp;P business and the somewhat improved volume development. The commodity, as well as the currency environment has proven to remain volatile, which is the key reason for which we deem it sensible to hold on to the absolute magnitude of the ranges.</p>
<p>Let me finally share a few thoughts quasi at early innings on my first weeks as CFO of E.ON. I am proud to be part of a very strong organization, committed to success and to delivering on what has been promised. The transaction is on full steam and even accelerating its efforts. We have reached critical milestones and will keep our eyes on the ball as we go with the preparation even as the business and regulatory environment is evolving.</p>
<p>I am fully convinced that E.ON is leading in a groundbreaking transformation for European utilities and for the power industry overall. Coming from the very competitive and end-market driven capital goods and healthcare industry where you literally have to earn your lunch every day, I will be keen to drive a more market -oriented mindset into the company and contribute to address the business model change the sector is facing.</p>
<p>In the past, my focus has been driving efficiency, return on invested capital and converting book earnings into meaningful cash earnings. I mentioned at the beginning of my speech that my approach to financial markets is based on two principles, transparency and performance. It is equally simple within the company, clear priorities and disciplined execution. This is all based on candid and respectful communications and a fair collaboration.</p>
<p>We still have a lot to do and everyone at E.ON is committed to get the transaction completed successfully and create value now and in the future.</p>
<p>I’d like to hand it over to Anke.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Anke Groth</strong></p>
<p>The first one on my list is Bobby Chada from Morgan Stanley. Hi, Bobby.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bobby Chada</span></strong></p>
<p>Two questions please. First of all, you alluded to the E&amp;P business, running perhaps better than you talked about back in -- earlier in the year. Can you give any more color around that and what impact it might have on the depreciation run rate also? And then the second question more for Johannes, I guess. You were very clear that, as you’ve always said, Uniper will be set up with a strong balance sheet to be able to live with all of its nuclear commitments. Can you be absolutely clear with us that regardless of whatever settlement you come to with the liability between future E.ON and Uniper; that is not going to affect the spin-off?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>Michael, do you want to start?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. With regards to E&amp;P business, there are obviously a lot of effects going up and down, but they are suffering basically also from the oil-price compression year over year, yet the outcome is better. So, the year-over-year EBITDA effect for the half is roughly €100 million and I would expect a similar run rate for the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Now, in terms of the depreciation, we told you that there might be some easing on the depreciation overall, yet as the volumes are going up, that easing will not entirely flow through, yet there are some other compensating effects on the depreciation line overall. So that in the second half I do expect a materially higher easing vis-à-vis the depreciation run rate of the first half.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>As far as this complex, ongoing debate on the nuclear decommissioning is concerned, we have two clear interests: to make certain that a better and sound resolution is found on the whole issue and thus, we are engaging with the government in a constructive dialog and we’re looking forward to commission work. But that is beyond our control.</p>
<p>And secondly, we will try to get access to whatever information is accessible on the way forward to see how we then can optimize our progress. But the more important news I try to be extremely clear on my beginning, we are committed to deliver our strategy, irrespective of [indiscernible] and thus, we might accommodate to news we learn, but it will not mean that we fundamentally deviate from the core focus of the two sides. And the provisions are sound and safe today. And however we set the balance sheet up in the end, and thus this is obviously an ongoing progress; we will make sure that that stays the way it is today.</p>
<p>Those are the only things I can at this point clearly communicate, because all the rest, we need to learn, we need to accommodate, but speculation that we will fundamentally deviate from our strategy are un-based. We will continue on our course because this is a fundamental belief that goes far beyond questions of some particular debate that come and go in Germany and thus that certainty shall be taken away from here. And also, the safety of provisions that have been given today will be reassured in the future and all the rest is depending on learning’s that we take. And we will use every day to accommodate and learn and finally, we do our best to make sure that investment is safeguarded in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anke Groth</span></strong></p>
<p>Vincent Gilles, Credit Suisse.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Vincent Gilles</span></strong></p>
<p>One question to Mr. Sen, one question to Mr. Teyssen. The question to Mr. Sen is very simple is could you help us -- I understand it’s not simple, but could you help us anticipate what the level of pension provision could be at the end of the year if we extrapolate the change in H1. Obviously, I’m referring here to the discount rate, because obviously, it’s not simple. And the second thing is, Dr. Teyssen, in your opening speech, you were very clear that there are tax issues obviously in the demerger process, but could you maybe give us a bit of an update on the potential cost of this processes, the tax bill that may come how, you will limit the tax bill and very contrast of the complexity of the question, but anything you could share with us would be very helpful.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>I’ll start so Michael can ensure the answer. I think there are two types of taxes and potential tax bills involved. The one has to do where we need to do our utmost that former restructurings that have been done in a way that was tax-efficient thus didn’t lead to tax bills are not suddenly, through this spinoff, create the tax bill we avoided in the past. And there, we talk several hundreds of millions. And therefore, we are structuring the spinoff in a way that we almost, it’s like an art, make sure that we don’t touch any of former restructuring issues and thus create tax bills of the past today. And this can only be done in a way that Uniper shares that stand for those past restructuring assets will not be touched initially. And as I said, all these tax-holding periods anyhow run now just a good year later at the end of ‘17. And this is what I’ve talked about. The artful creation of Uniper that might be hard to understand from the outside and that I cannot dig in too deeply here is done in a tax-efficient way to avoid those extra tax payments and thus we have all minority in the initial beginning for a good year before we can start to dissolve that. That is the one side and our intention is to not create any tax bill from that side.</p>
<p>The other side has to do with a lot of local taxes. If you transfer assets, you pay real estate tax. Sometimes you even pay it twice and it’s unavoidable in the greater context. And then there are other smaller tax items forward and backward. We don’t yet have the full assessment of those unavoidable tax bills coming along, but once we have a clear visibility we will disclose that obviously. It is a number, but it is not so excessive that it has any impact on our fundamental beliefs, but it’s subject to clarification from the tax authorities left and right, and visibility is just created all the time, so I cannot yet give you that number of the unavoidable tax bill. But the other tax would have been significantly higher, hundreds of millions beyond €500 million. And that we do our utmost to avoid a dime to be paid. And, Michael?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. I’d be happy to. There are high winds of what’s all from my side as well. Yes, you have been asking about the pensions and any effects and sensitivity. Well, I think let me allude you to also the annual report. I think it’s on page 164, something like that, there we already gave a flavor of the sensitivity.</p>
<p>But what you saw also happening in the first half, this was a 50 base points increase and there was an impact of 1.2 billion, already also gives you a little bit of a flavor of what can happen if interest rates go up and down. Yet, there are also many more effects impacting that position because in the 1.2 billion I’ve been alluding to, the interest rate hike obviously was the bulk of the effect.</p>
<p>But there are also other impacts like funding the CTA; we had a roughly €400 million funding of the German and there was also some funding of the UK CTA assets. So there are effects going up and down. A rough sensitivity is on, I think, page 164 of the annual report. Going forward, I’d refrain from commenting on where interest rates will go in the next couple of weeks and months, even though Mr. Fisher of the FOMC in the US already alluded to that it might go north, but I’ll refrain from commenting on it. If the interest rate as such does not change for the full fiscal, we will also have no incremental effect.</p>
<p><strong>Anke Groth</strong></p>
<p>The next one to ask question is Alexander Karnick from Deutsche Bank.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alexander Karnick</span></strong></p>
<p>The one question is related to E&amp;P and so that maybe just explain, or asking what are the underlying drivers for the better performance? Clearly, it must be volumes rather than prices. If you could elaborate on that please? The second question is back on nuclear. I’m keen to understand to what extent you are -- your level of interaction, dialog, exchange with the government is already taken place and whether you get a flavor out of that, that the government is also concerned with the current level of provisioning? That would be the two questions I have, thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>I would add to the nuclear question again and I agree it’s probably the people who ask the question, too much nuclear debate going on. I don’t have a precise insight on speculation on levels. Obviously, politicians also read the media and I think some people speculate on whatever technical solution could happen, then create funny numbers. On the other hand, I come back and we will be very explicit on that.</p>
<p>If you look on published numbers of estimated costs for final commissioning and final storage around the world, there’s only one single country that has higher decommissioning charges provisioned for than we, that is Switzerland. But Switzerland also has [bio distant] and older fleet and thus, significantly more spent fuel items than others. So I could say, likely with Swiss help, we have likely, in a comparable basis, the highest provisions on this globe. And therefore, any speculation that it’s insufficient would mean that the rest of the world is utterly dumb and unknown and doesn’t have any picture on that.</p>
<p>And therefore, I refrain from speculation what number you create. There are interested people that try to create funny numbers, but we feel that it’s more than sensible what we have done. And I also refer to the fact that the government has agreed that the stress test shall be done on the technical data that has already applied today for final storage decommissioning. And therefore, if that were totally unbased speculative technical plans, why would they do so?</p>
<p>So I have to base my beliefs on numbers and not public speculation. And politicians, we have had some early excess, but don’t forget the summer months and German politicians also like to travel, so we have not yet had all those context that we intend to try to get, to get a full flavor on their beliefs and their potential plans and whether those are just individual ideas and single ministries, or whether they could become government opinion over time. And there we have -- we hear sometimes conflicting messages. So I would say we don’t have visibility yet, but we will do our best.</p>
<p>And you can be sure, all we know and everything we believe is reflected in our provisions, even things that we deem unconstitutional. For example, the way that they have a variety of interim storage creations on their plans, which I think will likely be re-sued against and all those extra charges that we have no intention to pay, still we provision for them. And so we provision for them. So there is no unfunded or known gap in anything. And international comparison shows we are sound, we are conservative and we are well positioned and that is the facts with which we enter into any debate with anybody on this globe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>I’ll take the other question on the E&amp;P business. Reiterating to what I’ve been saying before, the 100 million year-over-year of compression in the first half, I would also envisage as being the run rate for the second half. Now, yes, there is a pricing compression, a material pricing compression of roughly $46 on the barrel for the first half. By the way, that will ease also a little bit in the second half because if you do remember Q3, Q4 last year, the oil price was already trending south. That is one impact. The second impact, they are having favorable FX because it’s partly U.S-dollar denominated. That’s not the main part. The main part is obviously the field performance, so higher output of roughly flattish to 1 MBOE up for the full fiscal. The field performance is up in the fields Njord and Skarv.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alexander Karnick</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks very much. But that implies so that it will counting with similar run rate that’s on the volume side. We expect a similar positive contribution the second half. Could you elaborate real quick what that means for the following years then? Because there seem to be some issues with, I think it was Njord, the rig there, and other sources, or other fields being in depletion. And I think in the past was always guided for a decline in volumes over the next couple of year coming up. Is that changing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, I hear you and I appreciate the interest, but we will stick to our outlook for the current fiscal. Usually the practice is that we would not comment now on the years ahead, so please bear with us. We’ll cross the bridge when we get there.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>Michael, the only thing I would add there I think is publicly known and published by the operator Statoil that the Njord platform needs to be restored, needs to be fixed sometime next year and that it will take some time then to do that. It’s nothing to do with depletion. There are even additional finds in that area, significant additional finds. It is just a technical problem with the platform and then Skarv, obviously, is at height and will naturally decline over time, but that’s nothing unknown. All of that is public knowledge published in the numbers by the government and everybody else and the operators.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anke Groth</span></strong></p>
<p>Peter Bisztyga, Bank of America Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Bisztyga</span></strong></p>
<p>Two questions on hedging, please. Firstly, can you just remind us your hedging strategy for E&amp;P and that also includes the pricing formula for Yuzhno Russkoje in Europe? And then my second question relates to outright power. Would it be reasonable to assume that 2018 outright power is probably 30% or 40% hedged by now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>So the hedging factors for the E&amp;P business is no long-term forward hedging. We do some tactical hedging for the operational year because obviously, we have seen a high volatility on volumes in that area and therefore, we are cautiously hedging but a couple of months ahead we do. But those hedges regularly run out within the same fiscal year or early next fiscal year. And that is true for oil and gas and usually, obviously, we sell the products at the next traded market price. As far as hedging for the conventional generation is concerned, for 2018, I would say the range would be lower than you expect. I think you alluded to 40% or so. I would see that more at half of that rate for 2018.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes and, Peter, I think you already heard a similar question at your conference where you tried to get a hold of the outright power position in 2018. On the North Sea, let me also contribute that we hedge roughly between 10% and 20% of the oil performance here. This is more UK-based. There is a reason for it, because there are some tax rulings in Norway where you then would have to pay taxes on the hedged price. So that explains a little bit that position.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Peter Bisztyga</span></strong></p>
<p>And sorry, just on Yuzhno Russkoje, the portion of that that is linked to European gas prices is that just one month ahead?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anke Groth</span></strong></p>
<p>Peter, I think we should come back to that question and go through the BAFA price formula and [indiscernible].</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>It is 50% of BAFA price, but you want to know more than just BAFA price, you want to know with what time horizon that is being done? We need to -- admittedly, we probably can look that up very fast, but we need to also see whether that is covered by confidentiality with our counterparty. So fundamentally, we always said its 50% BAFA and that’s European price and 50% is based on Russian price base. And whether further disclosures are allowed depends a bit on contractual terms. If that is allowed, we obviously would refrain from a partial disclosure, but we will then make sure that participants get the message.</p>
<p><strong>Anke Groth</strong></p>
<p>So, next one on my list would be Lawson Steele from Berenberg.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lawson Steele</span></strong></p>
<p>Three questions please. First of all, on the nuclear fuel tax, obviously, got the German Federal Constitutional Court ruling in the coming months. If the government were to win the case, do you think they might consider extending the tax beyond 2016, or do you put that chance at zero?</p>
<p>Secondly, now that you’re halfway through the year and fully hedged and so on, do you feel able to narrow down the quite wide range in that income guidance of 1.4 billion to 1.8 billion?</p>
<p>And then finally, on E&amp;P, can you talk a little bit about the cost evolution? How much of OpEx relates to lifting costs, and specifically lifting costs that are determined by energy prices? Given commodity prices are lower; do you see any future cost savings in that area please? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>I would only focus again on the slight nuclear questions and leave the rest to Michael. The Constitutional Court announced that it will hear the case and decide the case within this fiscal year, which we believe is helpful because obviously, it allows us also to then helpfully take a positive effect within this year in the E.ON accounts.</p>
<p>But I also alluded to the fact that the European courts defined the tax as a consumption tax which would then be without or beyond the constitutional range of the Federal Government of Germany.</p>
<p>So if the German Constitutional Court accepts the legal interpretation of that tax, in the same manner that the European court did, then it should come to the result that it’s unconstitutional according to German law, but it is obviously free to do a different construction.</p>
<p>What would it mean for further development? It has always been defined as a time-limited tax. I have heard some voices from lower ranks in politics, but not from within the government, playing with the idea of extending. I think that even counterintuitive to the same ongoing debate whether nuclear operations are financially sound and strong enough to fund their ongoing provisions. So at the one time, weakening nuclear cash flows, but the same time, asking for a proper set of provisions in other competitors is very counterintuitive. And, therefore, I would at least strongly define my belief that this will not happen.</p>
<p>Would I put it at zero? Only if I become Chancellor of Germany; otherwise, it’s beyond my control, so I can only speculate there. But I would definitely not hope that such an idea finds any traction in true governmental works. But that is it what I can say to it. And, Michael, to the range and the E&amp;P costs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I’m happy to. In my speech, I already alluded to the fact that we still would hold onto the range because there are a lot of moving parts going from left to right. By the same token, I also said we feel well positioned within that range.</p>
<p>So why are there a lot of moving parts? If you go back a couple of months when Klaus was still giving the call, at that time, the ruble was at a different point where it is today. And if I look to the newspaper, a recession not having an end to Russia, don’t know what this is going to do going forward, also in terms of translation effect in our P&amp;L. By the same token, we had some relief on the E&amp;P business, we’ve been elaborating at for quite a length now. And so there are a lot of moving parts. From that point of view, I think one risk already materialized one month delay of the barrel plant. So the range is the range, we are well positioned in that and I’ll keep it with that. So in terms of the relief in E&amp;P business on the cost side, yes there is some relief because it’s pegged to energy prices. But we would not quantify that at this point in time. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Anke Groth</strong></p>
<p>And the next one is Deepa from Bernstein. Deepa go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Deepa Venkateswaran</span></strong></p>
<p>I have two questions. I think both would be for Michael. So the first one is on you…</p>
<p><strong>Anke Groth</strong></p>
<p>I’m sorry to interrupt you but…</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Deepa Venkateswaran</span></strong></p>
<p>Both my questions are I think for Michael. First one is on the Italian asset sales. Could you just clarify what your intention with the wind farms in Italy are? Would they be sold or do you expect to retain that? And the second question is on Russia and the other items. So on Russia, you mentioned there’s one-month delay. Could you just clarify what is the status of the plant, and also, you mentioned that there was an impact of a fire? So full year, could you basically give your indication for where you would see on a local currency basis?</p>
<p>And secondly, the other item you mentioned that there are some one-off effects. Could you just give a little more color on what happened in first half and roughly where you would see the overall year-end other number to be trending at?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, I think there were a lot of questions. The first one was on Italy and the remaining business. So we have the wind farms in Italy. They are still under review so nothing to report on that. You may have read last week that yes, we are selling the hydro business but we are keeping the regional unit. So the regional unit, with a lot of customers having value, intrinsic value is going to be kept at E.ON. That was, I think, for the Italian business.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>For the Russian business maybe I pitch in from the sideline a bit. The plant in Bero is fundamentally finished and ready to be technically commissioned. We just need a number of technical licenses from a number of different authorities in Russia, and they follow a very specific process. They only work always towards the first of the month. And with almost a technical administrative project that derailed a bit the August 1, the target that we lately had, and it is now September 1.The fire item that was a small thing in Bero that was not so meaningful. The real technical fire problem happened at one of the blocks at the Surgut plant. So it’s a very different plant, a couple of thousand kilometers apart from each other, so no impact of that Surgut thing. Also, the main part was insured, so we got the money from an insurance. Obviously, we lost the production and that had an operational effect on this year’s number. So this is the main Russia news that I can add to your question. And then there was more to be answered by you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. On the Russian question, this was a one-off. The fire was a one-off in H1 which was insured, so I do not see that being repeated. And I think Johannes mentioned in his speech that on the Bero plant, we do expect that up and running as of September and then contributing. Now, to your question on the other line. I mentioned in my speech that the admin and consolidation piece will have a higher run rate for the full fiscal, so will be higher than what you have been seeing in last fiscal year. Okay?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anke Groth</span></strong></p>
<p>Deborah Wilkens, Goldman Sachs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Deborah Wilkens</span></strong></p>
<p>One question for Michael; one question for Johannes. I’ll start with the question for Michael, which is within the generation earnings, could you just give us a bit more detail what was the level of nuclear tax paid in the first half? And also, are you able to give us a sense of the level of off-market EBITDA for the first half? And then, Johannes, you’ll have to excuse me, I do have to come back to the nuclear provision discussion. A simple question I think; can you help us understand what, or if at all, clarity from the government is necessary for the demerger timetable to be maintained?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>I would say technically not. Technically, the process is always now controlled, and I have not heard about any plan whatsoever about anybody interfering in the technical do ability of the setup we intend to deliver on. The question is more do we learn anything that makes it more advisable to optimize our precise reaction to that. So it is not that there is any uncontrollable obstacle visible that would hinder us to deliver our strategy. That’s not the case, that’s why I said we are in full speeds of delivering. It’s only about do we learn news anywhere from the nuclear side or any other side that would lead us to a more optimized delivery fashion, but it would not alter our core belief on deliverables here.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Deborah, its Michael. From my side, the first one was on nuclear tax. The number we paid up until now, this is roughly in the neighborhood of €240 million. The non-wholesale earnings, we do not report out during the course of the year. So for the full year, probably you will see this number in the facts and figures.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Anke Groth</span></strong></p>
<p>Andreas Thielen from MainFirst.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andreas Thielen</span></strong></p>
<p>Firstly, again on strategy, assuming separation has happened, obviously, you’re running a very efficient organization today, what would that mean for the cost base for the two units? Would that be any different? You have to create new functions or separate functions. So, any guidance there?</p>
<p>And secondly, we have seen Vattenfall impaired Ringhals in Q2 by quite a considerable amount. You’re minority shareholder there. I appreciate that nothing has happened so far. But would you have to look into that item in the second half or can you say as of today you will not be affected at all? And finally and just very briefly, you mentioned that the final investment decision for Arkona could be near. Does that mean that you will take that during the course of the year, most likely?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Johannes Teyssen</span></strong></p>
<p>It’s quite obvious and we have been explicit on the fact that if you split a company that doesn’t create by itself new efficiencies, it creates some limited dyssynergies even in the beginning. We said it will be a very low three-digit number initially, and that has to do with these things like building up a procurement function, a risk function in E.ON. It has to do with having some financing capabilities that need to be duplicated between the two companies and so on and so forth. We also have been explicit that since both companies are significantly more focused, that can get rid of complexity and bureaucracy that might be unavoidable for the progress of the company. And therefore, we said within this midterm plan, we will already make certain that any initial dyssynergy will be offset by less of bureaucracy and higher efficiency in the two items.</p>
<p>So, I would say already now this midterm period, you will initially see some upbeat, some higher initial administration costs. But that will disappear. And I think we have been quite reliable on the delivery on our cost programs. You can be assured that the same will happen here. So a small initial peak, but then that being offset over this period. That is all I can say and I would not yet get very precise because we are working on some of those numbers also with our co-determination bodies and the unions. And I’m extremely proud that, until today, the front has always been very, very closed and together, and therefore, we would prefer that we don’t send messages to the financial markets before we have communicated them with internal things. But we are fully aligned and there is no split there and that is very valuable.</p>
<p>And the next question went to you Michael, I believe.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I think it was on Vattenfall. Obviously, I will not comment on what they have been disclosing and what their strategy is and acceleration and so on and so forth. But as you rightfully said, we are a minority shareholder. Looking at our half-year closing, there was no impact, so we, up until now had -- tangible triggering event which led us to believe to take something into our book. Yes, we have some book value, which probably is negligible, but we’re going to test the four blocks as a whole because that is the value-generating entity. But we are also in discussions obviously, with Vattenfall. Being a minority shareholder, there are specific corporate governance rules where they will and are going to talk to us. And if and when that is meaningful enough, then we’ll obviously update you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andreas Thielen</span></strong></p>
<p>Just to clarify that, when you talk about negligible book value that potentially means then something below triple-digit million?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andreas Thielen</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Michael Sen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, and it’s an equity investment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Andreas Thielen</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure that’s clear.</p>
<p><strong>Anke Groth</strong></p>
<p>And the last one on my list is Alberto Ponti from SocGen. So Alberto over to you for the last question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Alberto Ponti</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you but all my questions have been answered already. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong>Anke Groth</strong></p>
<p>That is great. So thanks everybody for listening and asking questions. The IR team is available in a couple of minutes to pick up any further questions which may arise today, tomorrow. So, please give us a call. That’s all from us. Thank you. And goodbye.</p>
