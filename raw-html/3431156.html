<p><strong>David Sun</strong></p>
<p>Hello everyone and thank you for joining us today to discuss our second quarter 2015 results. During the second quarter, we've made meaningful continued progress despite the difficult market conditions. Our revenue growth and RevPAR have been under pressure reflecting challenges in the surrounding environment.</p>
<p>However, we continue to take important steps to invest resources in areas what we see long term promise. A key sample of this relates to our digital capabilities. We continue to enhance our abilities in the area as evidenced by the fact that mobile app and WeChat user levels reached new highs. Also, our mid-scale business is continuing a strong trajectory and has been encouraging performance.</p>
<p>Let me highlight a few takeaways regarding to the overall performance during the quarter. Revenue was slightly lower than the previous provided guidance, reflecting what the entire lodging industry in China is going through.</p>
<p>Same hotel performance was negatively impacted by the difficult market conditions as we expected. However, we have achieved a good progress in building out our mid-scale offerings. Yitel hotels continue to perform well and the newly launched Homeinn Plus, as we see very positive initial market feedback.</p>
<p>Our membership net number is now standing at 38.6 million, almost double from a year ago. We continue to control cost and improve operating efficiencies in order to help us protect our margin and the bottom line.</p>
<p>Turning to the operations side, group occupancy rate decreased 3.4 percentage points for the second quarter from same period a year ago, while ADR decreased by 0.6%, resulting in a year-over-year decrease of 4.2% in RevPAR, mainly due to the ongoing difficult market conditions during the quarter. Sequentially, RevPAR increased by 13.3%, mainly due to seasonality. As a reminder, the first quarter is normally the lowest period in the year for both our companies and overall hotel industry in China.</p>
<p>This overall result indicates that our business remains under pressure as the external conditions continue to be quite challenging. Still, we are going to -- we are doing everything we can to effectively navigate through the tough climate.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2015 there were 2,103 mature hotels, or hotels in operation for at least 18 months. These hotels' occupancy rate decreased year-over-year from 88.1% to 84.7% and ADR decreased slightly year-over-year from RMB164 to RMB163, resulting in a decrease in RevPAR by 4.8% from RMB145 to RMB138 during the quarter.</p>
<p>However, during these difficult times for the industry we are keen to further refine our product offerings and improve customer service through internal programs. Moreover, we continue with our cost efficiencies initiatives with our mature hotels base in order to ensure a thorough foundation for our further business development.</p>
<p>Turning to the franchise portion of our business, we have stable performance over the second quarter and we're focused on transforming our Company into a predominantly franchised-and-managed hotel business. As of end of the second quarter, franchised-and-managed hotels represented 66.7% of our total hotels in operation, up from 62.2% in the same period a year ago and 65.7% as of end of last quarter.</p>
<p>In the second quarter of 2015, we opened 126 new hotels and 14 new leased-and-operated hotels and 112 franchised-and-managed hotels. The addition of the varied pipeline for franchised-and-managed hotels [indiscernible].</p>
<p>As of the end of the second quarter, we had 349 hotel projects in the development pipeline, which included 184 hotels contracted or under construction and another 154 [ph] under due diligence. 92% of these projects are for franchise-and-managed hotels demonstrating continuous interest from the franchise partners. This continues to be a strong platform for further business development.</p>
<p>During the quarter, we used innovative approach to recruit new members through the Alipay, China's leading third-party online payment platform launched by Alibaba and other channels, besides cooperate with existing online platform partners, we collaborate with Alibaba's online travel units, by placing our first flagship store on it during the quarter.</p>
<p>As of June 30, our frequent guest program reached a record high of 38.6 million unique non-corporate members, almost double from 19.7 million at same period of last year. The unique non-corporate members under the program contribute more than 63% of room nights sold during the quarter.</p>
<p>Next, I'd like to give you an update of our progress of our digital capabilities and expanding mobile presence and capabilities. Since the launch of our mobile app in October 2013, more than 4.2 million users have downloaded the app as of June 30. This is significantly up from 3.3 million as of March 31 this year.</p>
<p>As a proportion of our total room booking, bookings over mobile apps account for 27% of total bookings in the second quarter. We have also seen exceptional progress on the WeChat platform.</p>
<p>During the quarter, WeChat binding increased 26.6% to 2.4 million. Bookings on WeChat accounted for 2% of total room bookings.</p>
<p>Along with the launching of Homeinn Plus, we initiated the smart hotels campaign to provide a smartphone connected appliance system in the guest room for our customers.</p>
<p>Environment friendly customers are rewarded with Homeinn points. We will continue to build out our digital capabilities in order to meet the increasing customer demand for online solutions and optimize customers' experience. More importantly, we consider these as essential to cultivating our future digital customer base.</p>
<p>Looking at ongoing expansion of our brand portfolio, we launched a new mid-scale brand Homeinn Plus in April this year as a complement to our existing brand portfolio and to better capture opportunities in the mid-scale market where we're seeing emerging growth.</p>
<p>As of the end of the second quarter, we opened a total of nine Homeinn Plus hotels, with a robust pipeline underway, we are fully committed to accelerating the development of Homeinn Plus and we are also keen to further develop and expand our Yitel brand.</p>
<p>We predict that this mid-scale segment will be an important part of our business in the future and are therefore putting in place a strong foundation now.</p>
<p>In conclusion, while overall external conditions remain challenging, and this continues to have a dampening effect on our results. We continue to develop product offering, optimize the customer experience and further expand and engage with our customer base.</p>
<p>As we look ahead into the second half of 2015, the external condition will remain quite challenging and we are not counting on a market rebound in the remainder of the year. We therefore will continue to focus on the area that will help position us well and keep our overall business healthy.</p>
<p>In particular, we will further diversify our product offerings, a key example of these continue to study the development of our mid-scale business through the Homeinn Plus in detail. We will develop unique way to engage customers via traditional and digital marketing channels.</p>
<p>Our success with the app so far is a great start and we will continue to build on this, and in the meantime, we will pay heightened attention to the cost control and drive further efficiencies in our operations. We believe this is the right strategy that will not only help us to weather this industry storm, but more importantly ensure that we will be well positioned to capture growth when the [indiscernible] falls back.</p>
<p>With that, let me turn the call over to Ms. Cathy Li who will walk through the financials. Cathy?</p>
<p><strong>Cathy Li</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, David and hello everyone on the call. I will firstly start our second quarter 2015 results and then provide our current outlook for the third quarter and full year. I will take you through the numbers in RMB terms, unless specifically noted. In addition, I will mainly focus on non-GAAP or adjusted measures in the interest of time, throughout this presentation because we believe this result better reflects the underlying business performance and results.</p>
<p>For the second quarter, total revenue was RMB1.667 billion, decreasing 1.8% year-over-year. This is slightly lower than the guidance we provided before, which is RMB1.67 billion to RMB1.7 billion.</p>
<p>Revenue for our leased-and-operated hotels for the second quarter was RMB1.41 billion, a 3.4% decrease year-over-year, due to the decrease of RevPAR.</p>
<p>Revenue from franchised-and-managed hotels for second quarter was RMB256.7 million, an increase of 7.4% year-over-year, mainly driven by an increase in the number of hotels and hotel rooms in operation, partially offset by a decrease in RevPAR.</p>
<p>Total non-GAAP operating costs and expenses for the second quarter were 84.7% of total revenues, compared to 80.2% in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Now I will talk about the breakdown of the costs. Total adjusted leased-and-operated hotel costs were 88.9% of the leased-and-operated hotel revenue for the quarter, compared to 83.1% in the same period a year ago.</p>
<p>Preopening costs included in the quarter in the leased-and-operated hotel costs was RMB19.9 million compared to RMB6.8 million for the same period a year ago, due to the accelerating in the mid-scale hotel construction, the year-over-year increase in total leased-and-operated hotel cost, as a percentage of total leased-and-operated hotel revenues for the quarter was mainly due to the decrease in RevPAR resulting in a lower revenue base per hotel, while a significant portion of the hotel costs was fixed, as well as a higher preopening cost in the quarter.</p>
<p>Adjusted personnel costs of franchised-and-managed hotels was 24.5% of franchised-and-managed hotel revenues in the second quarter, compared to 22.6% in the same period a year ago. The year-over-year increase in personnel costs of franchised-and-managed hotels as a percentage of franchised-and-managed hotel revenues for the second quarter of 2015 was mainly due to the decrease in RevPAR resulting in a lower revenue base per hotel, which is partially offset by lower performance of bonuses in the quarter.</p>
<p>Adjusted sales and marketing expenses for the quarter were 1.5% of total revenues for the quarter, compared to 1.8% in the same period a year ago. The decrease was mainly due to the timing of certain marketing activities which is different from last year.</p>
<p>Adjusted general and administrative expenses for the quarter were 4.2% of the total revenues, compared to 3.7% in the same period of last year. This increase is caused by [indiscernible] related to a specific hotel project.</p>
<p>Turning now to the bottom line, as the market climate impacts our top line and the RevPAR [indiscernible] with higher preopening costs than last year did dampen our overall results.</p>
<p>Let's go into the details. Adjusted income for operations for the quarter was RMB146.1 million, or 8.8% margin rate, compared to RMB236.4 million, or 13.9% of margin rates for the same period in 2014.</p>
<p>The year-over-year decrease in income from operations margin rates for the quarter was mainly due to the lower revenue base per hotel and higher preopening costs.</p>
<p>Adjusted EBITDA for the second quarter was RMB356.1 million, or 21.4% of total revenues, compared to RMB442.3 million, or 26% of total revenues in the same period of 2014. Adjusted EBITDA decreased 19.5% year-over-year, for the quarter.</p>
<p>Net income attributable to shareholders was RMB72.1 million for the second quarter, compared to net income of RMB108.2 million in the same period of 2014. Adjusted net income attributable to shareholders was RMB105 million for the second quarter, compared to RMB168.4 million in the same period of 2014.</p>
<p>The year-over-year decrease in adjusted net margin rates was mainly due to a decrease in adjusted income for operations margin were partially offset by higher interest income and lower interest expense.</p>
<p>Diluted earnings per ADS for the second quarter was RMB1.5, or $0.24. Adjusted diluted earnings per ADS for the quarter was RMB2.14, or $0.35.</p>
<p>For operating cash flow, in the second quarter, the Company generated a net operating cash inflow of RMB352.8 million, compared to RMB365.8 million in the same period of last year.</p>
<p>Capitalized expenditure for the quarter were RMB196.6 million, while the cash paid for capital expenditure was RMB124.6 million.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2015, the Company had cash and cash equivalents of RMB891 million. The outstanding balance of convertible notes due in December of this year, measured at a fair market value, was RMB953.1 million. We have sufficient bank credit facilities in place to ensure the repayment of the notes.</p>
<p>Now turning to outlook, we are committed to our target of opening no fewer than 400 new hotels in the course of 2015, with approximately 10% as leased-and-operated hotels and 90% as franchised-and-managed hotels. We expect around 25% of the new hotels will be mid-scale hotels.</p>
<p>With respect to revenue outlook, we expect total revenues for the Company in the third quarter of 2015 to be in the range of RMB 1.83 billion to RMB1.8 billion.</p>
<p>For the full year, given the first half year performance and the ongoing softer-than-expected market conditions, the Company now expects total revenues for full year to be in the range of RMB6.55 billion to RMB6.65 billion, below the initial guidance we provided at the beginning of the year.</p>
<p>So, this concludes our prepared remarks and now let's open the lines for your questions. Operator, please.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Justin Kwok of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Kwok</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for taking my question. I have three questions. Perhaps I will start with the short one on the numbers and then a bit on the RevPAR and the last one on margins. The first one on the numbers, you mentioned that there is a one off provision to a specific hotel in the G&amp;A side, do you mind to talk a bit on what exactly is this and how much provision have you made? Also on the same note as that, I noticed on the other income and loss line, for this quarter it becomes a loss where in previous quarters usually it's a positive number which I believe is mostly coming from government grant, so what exactly has changed on this? This is on the numbers.</p>
<p>The second question is on the RevPAR, do you mind to talk a bit on the Yitel and in this quarter for Yitel alone how do you see the RevPAR trending on a year-over-year basis? Is this going down as the whole market or is it just going up because of the increasing brand recognition?</p>
<p>The last one on margins, do you mind to give some guidance on what you're seeing on the margins outlook for the rest of the year? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Justin. That's three questions. Let me answer one by one. The first one you're asking is about the provision in the G&amp;A. in this quarter, we have made the provision for RMB8.7 million which is about a provision for a hotel project, which was a leased-and-operated hotel, which we constructed a few years ago. Later we sold it to our franchisee and now, somehow the [indiscernible] franchisee partners, and we see quite a big risk of not able to get the money back [indiscernible] in this quarter, reviewing the situation and the possibility of getting the money back.</p>
<p>Second one, for other income, this one actually is not government [indiscernible] it is more related to the kind of [indiscernible] some of our hotels, sometimes we get compensation from the [indiscernible] project, but this year unfortunately we haven't got enough kind of compensation compared with our costs linked with hotels closed due to [indiscernible].</p>
<p>On Yitel, although our overall RevPAR has declined about 4.8% for this quarter, whereas on the mid-scale we do see a quite encouraging performance for Yitel sales although we only have about -- close to about 20 hotels in operation, I mean, more than 18 months, mature hotels but we do see high single digit growth in the RevPAR trend, which has been continuing for last few quarters, which is very encouraging, which also further enhanced our confidence to accelerate the mid-scale segment including Yitel and Homeinn Plus. The Homeinn Plus also we only have nine hotels opened. The first opened in April, but last two months, [indiscernible] we do see very encouraging market feedback and customer feedback. So, we do have a good kind of covenant to further accelerate the Homeinn Plus too.</p>
<p>The last one's margin, margin side, for margin, we mainly keep three factors. The first one is for the leased-and-operated hotels. For this one, the RevPAR is really a very critical factor to impact our gross margin, because quite a big portion of the operating cost, like rental and personnel cost is fixed. So, other costs, we are doing lots of kind of activities to doing cost control and improvements, the big portion is quite fixed. So, for example in this quarter, this RevPAR decline did have a quite big impact -- an actual impact on leased-and-operated hotels margins.</p>
<p>Second factor is opening expense. This quarter we have an increase of about RMB13 million in the preopening expense, RMB19 million versus RMB7 million last year. This one, we treat is as kind of investment for future, because as I have mentioned, we do believe we have a good confidence for the mid-scale segment, so we are investing now to build up and accelerate the constructions of our mid-scale hotels and especially for the Homeinn Plus as we just launched this April, we do need to have a very good foundation with the leased-and-operated hotels to view that good product standard, performance for operating for kind of customer management -- customer program. So, this year -- this quarter, we have about 15 mid-scale hotel projects in construction compared with last year, we only had two in the same quarter. So this interest on one hand is really in line with our strategy whereas on the other hand too have the impact for our short term margin and profitability.</p>
<p>The third one is linked with franchise-and-managed hotels mix. This part, as we are transforming to a dominant predominantly franchise-and-managed hotel Company, the more polishing of franchise-and-managed hotels do help in our margin improvement. While for these year and also for this quarter, because negative impact in the leased other hotels is too big, with much higher RevPAR decline, so the benefit we have gained rather increased the portion of higher margin franchise business cannot compensate for the negative impact due to the RevPAR decline.</p>
<p>So, these three factors put together cause margin decline for this quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Kwok</span></strong></p>
<p>Right. Thanks. Just maybe one quick follow up, as you mentioned the Homeinn Plus with the few hotels open, so very encouraging result and what does the pricing premium that you're seeing for these hotels versus the mainstream Homeinn product?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think Justin, we've positioned Homeinn Plus about 1.3 to 1.5 times of the typical Homeinn product. So, in the mid-scale sectors, Homeinn Plus would be 1.3 to 1.5 times of the basic Homeinn product and Yitel would be positioned on 1.6 to 2 times of the basic Homeinn price. So, that's the position.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Kwok</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. I'll just jump back to the queue. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Shang Koo of One North Capital. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good morning and thank you very much for the call. Two book questions for me. First question is about the -- how do you see the RevPAR trends for the mid-scale hotels versus the budget hotels? If you could please give me a sense of how it's trended across these two different formats on a year on year basis.</p>
<p>The second question relates to your current portfolio of leased hotels as well as for the managed franchise or managed hotel portfolio. Maybe you could just help me understand, how much in terms of percentage terms of your leased hotels portfolio is loss making at this point and also if you could comment the same for the managed-and-franchised hotel portfolio. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>On the RevPAR trend, as Jeff also mentioned, for the mid-scale we do see a quite different trend versus the budget hotels. For Yitel hotels, the RevPAR for the mature hotels, which have been in operation for 18 months at least, showed a high single digit RevPAR growth [indiscernible]. Whereas the other hotels, we do have some pressure, we can see, kind of a low single digit decline in the RevPAR. I think the reason behind this for the mid-scale impact is the demand in the market is growing, because there are more and more people have a capability and also the lifestyle to the kind of service in that product offering, and while the supply in the market is quite limited, so far there is no real kind of market leader in this segment. So, for this segment, in the past few years, potential to -- also the economy one, because we have already a very high base and also the supply and demand has somehow reached a kind of equilibrium. There's not much room to enjoy the benefit of higher demand than the supply can benefit. So, [indiscernible] performance.</p>
<p>For the second question, Koo, could you please repeat the question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah. I just wanted to understand what percentage terms of your leased hotel portfolio that is currently loss making at this point and you could also comment the same for the managed-and-franchised hotel portfolio too. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>I think overall the performance of our leased hotel and franchised hotel is quite similar, because we do the project evaluation for all the projects, that is the franchised or leased-and-operated type of hotel, and for this year, with overall soaked market conditions across all the country and across all the industries and the lodging industry also had been kind of seeing [indiscernible] kind of macro-economic impact. So, overall I think both leased-and-operated hotels and franchise-and-operated hotels has suffered more compared with before, and also, I think the relative performance of the hotels also less good as last year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, but I just want to understand, if you had 100 hotels, how many of them are currently loss making?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>First one also for hotel industry the different quarters have a very different performance. So, Q1 is which is the worst flow for the full year for the industry. Then a lot of hotels are making loss in Q1, while Q3 normally will be our peak time for our industry, so a lot of -- I think majority of the hotels are performing quite well with good profitability. So, I think I mean, and also this year, also for example for next few quarters, there's a lot of uncertainties ahead of us, so it's difficult to say, for the full year how many, really what percentage will be the loss making or not based on current visibility, but I think the portion will be higher than last year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>So, what was it last year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>I think kind of high kind of two digits.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Somewhere in the teens is it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Can you just help me on the -- I know you made a lot of commentary about the general environment is weak. If you could delineate the weakness for example, corporate versus leisure because I think the commentary for most of last year was that the corporate side was weak but do you notice some weakness now in the leisure travel segment as well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, you're correct. I think overall speaking for the last 12, 18 months we see the most impact is from the corporate business. So, the trends are still there. So, most of the impact, net impact is coming from the corporate business environment. For the leisure we see special -- like Q3 is a big season for the leisure market. [indiscernible] is carrying some structural change in special, outbound, inbound, overall speaking still is quite stable leisure market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So you're seeing for the leisure side, you're seeing a little bit more shift, some shift meaning that some people are doing more of their vacations outside of China, outbound more and more? There's a growing trend with outbound right?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, we see this factor's different if compared with a couple of years ago. Outbound customer is getting increasing very strongly.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you, very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Yaoxin Huang from CICC. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Yaoxin Huang</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you for taking my question. My first question is about the industry [indiscernible] acquiring some other hotels and do you believe that this kind of consolidation is better for this industry? Secondly, you mentioned that more and more people, Chinese people, tourists are going outbound and some hotel group are planning to acquire some international hotels and do we have some plans to expand in other countries for example a hot tourist destination like Japan or Thailand or acquire some other international assets? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think first of all in the soft market environment condition times always have a lot of industrial acquirement, acquisitions will happen. I think it demands how we can synergise all the factors. So, I think that will be ultimately in everywhere. So, I think that also we see in the industry for the last three, four months [indiscernible]. So, I think that will be the normal effect. So, for the overseas spending, I think, currently, as a Company we are always keeping in mind for the strategy to see how we can bridge between China market also the overseas, especially for the South China, so we do have some what we call initiative or connecting with some of the potential partner in the area of the country. So -- but I think it's -- in [indiscernible] doing some acquisition or buying some foreign company in this stage.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Yaoxin Huang</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, thank you David and another question is about how is the progress of our go private place? How is it going now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think everything is on track. I think [indiscernible] is the process of doing that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi Yaoxin. Yes, we -- since we announced this kind of -- we received the non-binding offer from the buyer group in 11th of June, but now the Board has set up a committee which comprised of our three independent directors. So, they also have engaged the independent financial advisor and they will conclude, to evaluate this offer and also other kind of potential strategic alternative. So, now they're still in the process to re-evaluate it and there's no further updates so far.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Yaoxin Huang</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Got it. Thank you, very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Mr. Billy Ng from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Billy Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi. Good morning. Basically, my first question is regarding closure. Like, is that -- this quarter, we have about 35, 37 hotels being closed, a new normal and at a new run rate when we model forecast for the next couple of years, we should roughly anticipate about 100 plus hotel closing every year, something like that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi Billy, and for this quarter, we have closed 37 hotels of which 7 actually is converged to Homeinn Plus and two changed to franchise-and-managed hotels [indiscernible]. So, the underlining closure is 28 hotels. So, comparing our total of about 2,700 economy hotel, this I think represents quite a small percentage and the majority of which is due to the rental [indiscernible] projects. While we've more challenging performance in certain low tier cities, we also see some closures due to the product performance.</p>
<p>As the market is weaker compared with two years ago, the franchisees would join the franchise two years ago did have a high expectation than the current reality which caused some of them to close the hotels now when nothing appeared -- did not recovery, where our return is lower than two years ago, still we think is another investment opportunity in some franchisees comparing with the other investment alternative opportunities, and, also, I think what people who join us now actually have a more realistic expectation of investment return on the current market environment. So, we think for this year, the trend for the rest of the quarter will be similar as Q1 and Q2, kind of around 20 or 25 closures each quarter. For the future years, we expect kind of a slowdown of that, adjusting trend.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Billy Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. That's very helpful. Then, another question, I know you guys gave out the guidance and also talking about the challenging environment, but any trends you can share for the last two months, July and this month August and also what kind of things -- is there any indicator we'll have to see a potential turnaround or what are the indicators you guys are looking and pay attention to at this point?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I think it's -- now we are in the middle of the August, so for one and a half months for Q3, we're seeing the overall market still is quite challenging, but I said before, the leisure market gives some help to see the some improvement for the Q3. So, overall speaking the net area of comparison would be getting narrow impact compared with Q1 and Q2. So, in future, we are not seeing very clear signs to see any rebound in the market condition, especially for the economy and on the [indiscernible] we're not seeing any strong, very clear sign to see that. So, it's very hard for us to say, the market condition will be getting turned around in the very near future.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>I'll add one more point. I think also one thing that we notice is the performance during this weak economy is also linked quite strongly to the negative, so we see in kind of close to the time we finally suffer more, where in the peak time, like July and August as David mentioned, which is our peak time, with lots of traditional covenant. We do see a kind of a narrow RevPAR decline. We also see that for September and for Q4. This has been reflected in our guidance we give to the public.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Billy Ng</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks a lot.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Lin He from Morgan Stanley. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lin He</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good mooring, David, Cathy and Mingjia. Thanks for the presentation. Two questions for me. One is on the cash flow side. So, it seems like the operating cash flow is more resilient than the EBITDA trend for example, operating cash flow is only down 3.5% this quarter on a year-over-year basis, versus more than 15% decline for EBITDA. Can you please add a bit more color on that on what is the driver behind that?</p>
<p>My second question is, the Homeinn Plus product that you mentioned, that you have closed down seven leased-and-operated hotels and are converting them into Homeinn Plus. I'm just curious. Firstly, why do you choose to do conversion in Q2 when supposedly it's the peak time for operation and secondly, what kind of properties and hotels do you think are proper for this kind of conversion? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>The first one, for the cash flow -- operating cash flow, in this quarter, we do have quite stable cash flow generation compared to last year, this actually linked with the working capital timing in Q1, if you kind of remember, in Q1 we have a relatively quiet poor operating cash for generation, because some kind of items we have paid in Q1. So, if we include Q1 [indiscernible] EBITDA kind of trend. It's no big changes. So, it's more kind of panning or facing between Q1 and Q2.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, weighing for the -- renovate for the Homeinn Plus from the Homeinn hotel itself is really -- we see a couple of reasons, first is we see this scale of hotels really have a very good market to grow and the choice how we select the existing Homeinn hotels, first we look at the location. So, the location, some of the Homeinn hotels have a very good location to receive the business travellers -- having [indiscernible] experience of the new products. So, this is the first location, the location is suitable for this scale hotels. Second is really, it depend on the cost.</p>
<p>The Homeinn hotel, the contract of the leasing is 10 to 15, 20 years, so by the time, some of the properties is close to the end of the contract, so we try to negotiate with the landlord to extend the leasing terms, but the rental will be getting high, so it's not suitable for these rentals still running on low pricing of the existing Homeinn hotels, but it would be suitable for operate for the renovate to the Homeinn Plus as a high price deploying product. So, that would be the reason behind why we renovate some of the existing Homeinn hotels to the Homeinn Plus. For the reason why it's in Q2, that is really because renovation will take about three, four months, so even some properties is renovating in March, that will be locked till the April, May, June. So, that cost would be located in the second quarter.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>And also, I guess one more Lin, for all those hotels we have done the evaluation, so we see a clear kind of incremental, higher incremental return on investment for the increasing ongoing Homeinn hotel upgrade or for the kind of hotel which we've kind of closed to the renew of the rental contract, both we can have a trade price premium and to compensate the investment and as for the timing, we are trying to minimize the impact of peak time of Q3, also aim to speed up this conversion to have a good product in place as fast as we can, to capture this fast growing segment.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Lin He</span></strong></p>
<p>That's very clear and helpful. Thanks David and Cathy.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>We have a follow up question from Mr. Justin Kwok of Goldman Sachs. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Kwok</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my question again. I've got a question on the membership number. I think David mentioned in the quarter, now you have a 38 million active non-corporate individual user or individual customers and the portfolio for the second quarter, which has almost doubled on a year-over-year basis, but I just want to get a sense on what have you done differently in the recent past where, how you're going to increase the number of customers in such a fast pace, where your portfolio is not going as fast and also, in general weaker e-comm and I just want to see what happened to the membership and what's the background on driving this fast growth? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>Very good question, Justin. I think, two ways we are fast growing our membership base. First is, we are using more channel to attract what we call the new customers, just like I mentioned in my presentation, we are coping with Alipay this new, the third party platform for getting more new fresh customer compared with the existing third parties we're using and also the hotels themselves. Second is, we are -- we [indiscernible] the membership program. All of the member will be getting as we call it, pay program, you have to pay RMB4 for basic and then business and then premium. So, now we are -- as we call it the new structure will be adding on the other what we call e-club members. So the first e-club member will be free to enter into the membership program, then using the points to upgrade into the common member and also the gold members.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Kwok</span></strong></p>
<p>I see. So, in that 38 million members, so how many of them will be the new so called e-club member and how much of them are actually the original or the business class where people have paid to be a member?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>It's kind of 5 million to 8 million is kind of e-club member.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Justin Kwok</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, very helpful. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Okay, we have a follow up question from Shang Koo of One North Capital. Your line is open, please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you again. I've just got a question on -- maybe if you could provide some insights and comments about the consolidation of the OTA market and the impact or implications for the lodging industry in China, probably you can comment more from the perspective of operator like yourself.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>I think we are very hard to come on the OTA, [indiscernible] OTA consolidation and these sort of things. I think from -- we believe third party OTA still is quite important partner with us. We've seen stable cooperation with [indiscernible] even now, we are -- new way to cooperate [indiscernible] and this sort of new channels. So the percentage of the customer from the OTA, stable in our ways -- about 6% to 8% to 10%, 12% of the percentage of our total customers. So, we believe that is quite stable channel for us to operate.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>And also, the key strategy for us is to make sure our own channel is a main source of our customers -- for customers, so we ensure our own membership is the best [indiscernible] OTA is acting kind of complementary to help us to attract new customer and hence maybe a sort of new member, but our own membership is taking more than close to -- more than 53% we have the corporate contracts. So, those two already contribute more than -- around 75% of the total bookings. That's the main channel for us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, but do you see a competition between the two ecosystems? I mean, again, on the day the customer acquisition came between you and the OTAs, how do you see that playing out? How much are you spending on customer acquisitions at this point?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>So you mean the cost of the customer acquisition for the --?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, yes incentives and all that. I mean, gift point systems and all the people would also contribute towards that I guess acquisition cost right? I'm just trying to understand, does this mean you're entering a period of higher acquisition cost?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">David Sun</span></strong></p>
<p>I think it used to be quite different, if you're using the third party channel compared with the own channel to achieve the customer one off customers, but I think by the competition of the overall third party OTA, industry that gap is getting smaller.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Cathy Li</span></strong></p>
<p>And also, actually I think our costs to acquire the new customer, because we already have quite a lot of members and also we have lots of physical hotels on ground and capabilities to attract customers. So, our costs for getting new customers is relatively much cheaper than the OTA. We have done some discussion comparison within.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Shang Koo</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>There are no further questions at this time. Mr. Sun and Ms. Li, please continue.</p>
