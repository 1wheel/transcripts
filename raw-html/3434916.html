<p><strong>Jeff Abbey</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, John. Good afternoon, everyone and thank you for joining us on our call today. During today's call, I will summarize our recent progress and milestones, particularly in our pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial of AGS-003 as well as other anticipated clinical and corporate milestones we expect to achieve during the coming months. Charles will then discuss the recent formation of our Scientific Advisory Board and review the status of AGS-004, our HIV program, and Lori will review our financial results for the second quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>Before we get started, I want to inform you that Doug Plessinger, our Vice President of Clinical &amp; Medical Affairs recently left Argos. Doug joined us in 2011 after serving as clinical consultant for Argos since 2007, and has played a leading role in the design, implementation and execution of our Phase 3 ADAPT trial. Now that the trial has concluded patient enrollment, Doug has decided to move on to his next role. With his family still living in Cincinnati, Doug found a physician there allowing him to spend more time with them. He has basically been living out of his suitcase of the past several years and made this decision on personal factors, something we cannot understand. On behalf of all of us at Argos, I want to thank Doug for his many outstanding contributions to the company, including leaving us with a strong clinical and medical affairs team, and wish him the best of luck in his future endeavors. Irrespective of Doug's departure, we had planned and still do plan to hire a Chief Medical Officer to oversee clinical development, clinical operations and Medical Affairs.</p>
<p>I will now talk about our recent progress, as well as what lies ahead. We have made significant headway over the past few months particularly with our lead product candidate AGS-003. AGS-003 is a fully individualized immunotherapy which is based on our proprietary Arcelis Technology platform. Arcelis is designed to overcome the disease-induced immunosuppression that exists in patients and to stimulate the patient's own immune system to activate a long-lasting memory T-cell response specific to the patient's disease without toxicity. As most of you are aware, AGS-003 is currently being evaluated in a pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial for the treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma or mRCC. This is single pivotal Phase 3 trial is being conducted under a special protocol assessment or SPA and is designed to evaluate AGS-003 in combination with Sutent or other targeted therapy versus Sutent or targeted therapy alone.</p>
<p>As I mentioned, we have completed enrollment in the trial and approximately 450 newly diagnosed fully eligible mRCC patients across a 130 global sites have been randomized to the treatment phase. To reach this goal, more than 1,100 patients were screened after successful tumor collection. This makes our ADAPT trial the largest clinical trial ever conducted in patients with newly diagnosed metastatic RCC. The breakdown of patients enrolled is approximately 75% intermediate risk patients, meaning they present with one or two of the baseline risk factors at diagnosis and approximately 25% poor risk patients, meaning they present with three or four of those risk factors at diagnosis. This breakdown is key because in our Phase 2 trial of AGS-003 plus Sutent, as first line therapy, the median survival for the 11 intermediate risk patients in the trial was 61.9 months, greater than five years. This represents an approximately three-fold increase versus the median survival of 20.5 months reported for 548 intermediate risk mRCC subjects treated with Sutent alone as first line targeted therapy across six Phase 2 and three studies as reported by Professor Cella during the 2014 ASCO Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.</p>
<p>Interestingly, in these studies, in the 223 patients who presented with two risk factors, median survival was only 14.5 months. Nearly 50% of the patients enrolled in our ADAPT trial presented with two risk factors. In our Phase 2 trial of AGS-003 plus Sutent, as first line therapy, the median overall survival of the patients who presented with two risk factors and those who presented with one risk factor was similar, i.e., approximately five years. Since each of the six risk factors is highly correlated with survival, clear cell mRCC is one-off, if not the only cancer, where survival may accurately be predicted at diagnosis. We believe that this allows accurate prediction of overall survival data in the control arm of the Phase 3 ADAPT trial upon which the statistical analysis plan is based.</p>
<p>In addition to completing enrollment in the trial, our independent data monitoring committee or IDMC meet this past June and conducted the first of three planned interim analysis to review safety, quality of steady conduct and outcomes. Based on this interim analysis at approximately 25% of events, the IDMC recommended the study should continue without any recommended changes. Going forward we expect the IDMC to convene approximately every six months moving as closer to the next interim data analysis point at 50% events followed by the final interim analysis at 75% events. We look forward to these further reviews by the IDMC and believe that AGS-003 has the potential to become first line standard of care treatment for mRCC in combination with Sutent and the other targeted therapies.</p>
<p>Because of the potential broad applicability of the Arcelis technology platform, we believe AGS-003 maybe potentially applicable to a wide range of other cancers as well. Just last week the first patient was dosed in an investigator initiative trial of AGS-003 for the treatment of early stage RCC. For studies being conducted at Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, New York, and is designed to enroll a maximum of 10 patients who will be treated with AGS-003 before nephrectomy in order to assess immune system response and tumor effects. We hope to have preliminary data from this trial with respect to safety, feasibility and initial immunologic effects of AGS-003 in an early stage RCC setting relative to an induction of memory T-cells in the second half of next year. Furthermore, our other investigator initiated studies evaluating AGS-003 in other RCC settings and in other solid tumors including bladder and lung cancers are planned to begin later this year.</p>
<p>On the corporate partnering front, recall that early in the second quarter we announced that Lummy HK licensed from us the rights to manufacture, develop and commercialize AGS-003 for the treatment of cancer in China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macau. Lummy agreed to pay us a royalty on net sales of AGS-003 at a rate in the teens and up to an aggregate of $20 million for regulatory and commercial milestones. In connection with this agreement, in the second quarter we sold approximately $10 million of common stock at a price of $10.11 to an affiliate of Lummy and to the China BioPharma Capital I Fund. And the purchasers have agreed to purchase an additional $10 million of our stock upon the completion of certain events with respect to AGS-003. We believe this agreement further validates the broad applicability of AGS-003 and our Arcelis platform. And we look forward to the development of AGS-003 by Lummy in Greater China to potentially treat an entirely new population of cancer patients.</p>
<p>Turning now to our plan to be fully integrated commercial immuno-oncology company, we continue to progress with our commercial manufacturing facility. The automated centralized facility will be used to support our Arcelis based individualized immunotherapy product candidates including AGS-003. The facility shell has been completed and we are planning to commence with the build out of the facility in the near term.</p>
<p>With that, I will now turn it over to Charles, who will provide an update on our recently created Scientific Advisory Board and on the development of our second Arcelis based immunotherapy, AGS-004 for HIV.</p>
<p><strong>Charles Nicolette</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Jeff. Last month we announced the formation of our first ever Scientific Advisory Board which includes world renowned oncologists and immunologists. These distinguished scientists will provide us with their guidance and perspectives as we continue the research and development of fully individualized immunotherapies. Their input will be specially valuable as we continue our pivotal Phase 3 ADAPT trial of AGS-003 in mRCC, and as we begin testing AGS-003 and other settings. We believe the creating of the Scientific Advisory Board is crucial for the development of our immunotherapies as it helps to advance our clinical programs and validates our scientific and clinical trial design choices.</p>
<p>Now I'll briefly discuss our HIV program. As we reported earlier this year data from our Phase 2b trial of AGS-004 provide a preliminary evidence of the ability of AGS-004 to induced memory T-cell responses which were associated with lower latent viral reservoirs in a statistically significant manner. These findings are directly relevant to the current investigator initiated adult eradication study of AGS-004 of that, as we recently announced is being funded by the NIH division of AIDS.</p>
<p>The study is being executed in two stages; stage one is ongoing and is designed to study the kinetics of the immune response induced by AGS-004 in patients while on antiretroviral therapy, this information is necessary to optimally combine AGS-004 with the latency reversing drug vorinostat in stage 2, where the investigator will employ the kick-and-kill strategy for the first time in the clinical study in patients. Our expectation is that combining AGS-004 with vorinostat will activate latent virus and could enhance the impact that AGS-004 had on the latent reservoir in our Phase 2b trial. Eliminating the latent virus reservoir is widely accepted as in a central goal in efforts to eradicate HIV.</p>
<p>Also we are still considering an investigator initiated Phase 2 clinical trial of AGS-004 monotherapy in pediatric patients infected with HIV at birth. The study would be conducted in adolescents that have been treated with ART drugs since birth of shortly thereafter. These children have no natural immunity to the virus so the goal of the study would be to provide that immunity possibly allowing long term ART independence. We are in ongoing discussions with clinical protocol designs with the NIH division of AIDS and the leadership of the international maternal pediatric adolescent AIDS clinical trials or impact network. We plan to provide a projection of when the trial could initiate upon completion of these discussions.</p>
<p>Lastly, I want to follow up on our development work based on previous clinical data with AGS-004. The limited viral load control after ART interruption in the Phase 2b trial, even though we induced memory T-cells, combined with the observation from our Phase 2a trial where the duration of ART interruption was inversely correlated with the number of PD-1 positive T-cells in the blood, suggest that the virus is exploiting the PD-1, PD-L1 checkpoint pathway to its advantage. To better understand how the virus is abating the immune response after ART interruption, we have initiated a preclinical study to determine the compatibility of AGS-004 with a PD-1, PD-L1 checkpoint inhibitor. If the data are supportive, we would expect to plan a combination trial.</p>
<p>I will now turn the call over to Lori, who will review our financial results for the second quarter.</p>
<p><strong>Lori Harrelson</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Charles. Argos's cash, cash equivalents and short term investment at the end of the second quarter totaled $30.6 million compared to $56.2 million as of December 31, 2014. The decrease results primarily from cash used to fund our Phase 3 clinical trial of AGS-003, our commercial manufacturing development efforts, and certain costs related to the construction of our new facility, partially offset by the proceeds received from the sale of our common stock to Lummy.</p>
<p>We continue to expect that our cash, cash equivalents in short term investments including the recently received second and final tranche of $12.5 from our debt facility with Horizon Technology Finance and Fortress Credit anticipated proceeds of $10 million from the sale of our common stock to Lummy in early 2016 upon the completion of certain events with respect to AGS-003 and anticipated funding under our NIH contract will enable us to fund our operating expenses into the second half of 2016.</p>
<p>Funding will focus on the Phase 3 clinical trial of AGS-003, the ongoing and planned investigator initiated Phase 2 clinical trials of AGS-003, the funding of certain manufacturing costs of the investigator initiated adult eradication study of AGS-004, and the funding of certain but not all costs related to the build out and equipping of our new commercial manufacturing facility for which we will need additional funding.</p>
<p>Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the three months ended June 30, 2015 was $19.6 million or $0.95 per share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $12 million or $0.61 per share for the same period in 2014. Net loss attributable to common stockholders for the six months ended June 30, 2015 was $37.2 million or $1.84 per share compared to a net loss attributable to common stockholders of $22.8 million or $1.52 per share for the same period in 2014.</p>
<p>Revenue for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $0.1 million compared to $0.5 million for the same period in 2014. Revenue for the six months ended June 30, 20015 totaled $0.3 million compared to $1.3 million for the same period in 2014. The expected decline in revenue is due to the winding down of activities in our Phase 2b clinical trial of AGS-004 which resulted in decreased reimbursement under our NIH contract.</p>
<p>Research and development expenses for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $16.1 million compared to $10.6 million for the same period in 2014. Research and development expenses for the six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $30.9 million compared to $19 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in both periods was primarily due to increased activity in connection with our pivotal Phase 3 clinical trial of AGS-003 and their commercial manufacturing development efforts.</p>
<p>General and administrative expense for the three months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $2.9 million compared to $1.9 million for the same period in 2014. General and administrative expense for the six months ended June 30, 2015 totaled $5.3 million compared to $3.8 million for the same period in 2014. The increase in both periods was primarily due to increases in personnel cost, including stock-based compensation, outside services including consulting services, and other expenses incurred due to our status as a public company.</p>
<p>We expect to file our 10-Q with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on August 14. With that, I will now turn the call back over to Jeff.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Abbey</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Lori. As I stated at the beginning of the call, we have made strong progress over the past few months. To recap, the ADAPT trial is now fully enrolled; the IDMC reviewed interim data at approximately 25% of events and recommended the trial continue without changes, and we now await additional interim data and analysis by the IDMC followed of course by the final data.</p>
<p>In addition, we formed and conducted the first meeting of our Scientific Advisory Board, and the new clinical trial of AGS-003 was initiated in early stage RCC patients at Roswell Park. We look forward to keeping all of you updated on the progress of our clinical trials, as well as other milestones and events.</p>
<p>With that operator, we can open up the call for Q&amp;A.</p>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Our first question comes from the line of Charles Duncan from Piper Jaffray. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Duncan</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi guys, thanks for taking my question and congratulations on completing the enrollment of the ADAPT trial in the quarter. Jeff, I wanted to ask you a couple of questions about the ADAPT trial and the first one is regarding Doug, I hope this doesn't come off in a way that he is not intended but I'm wondering if it sounds like there were clearly some - just some personal reasons for leaving but I guess I'm wondering if there was anything that he shared with you about the conduct of the trial or frankly, better maybe, what if you done to diligence his interactions with principal investigators, have you kind of had checks and balances all the way through the conduct of that trial?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it's a good question. I think Doug was extremely disappointed not to be able to stay with Argos, I think as I said; it really was purely personal and family related. No one has been more committed to getting the trial enrolled with the right patient population and working closely with our key investigators, particularly the PIs, Dr. Figland and Dr. Wood, then Doug. But I spoke with both Chris Wood and Bob Figland and Doug spoke with both and we had a call, and they understand Doug's decision and everybody couldn't be more pleased with the enrollment and the patient population we enrolled and the repedity with which enrolled the study and where we are today. And I think the only question one could ask is, is there possible something Doug could know that nobody else knows and the answer is absolutely not. Even if he could know anything, it's way, way, way too early to really know anything but he doesn't have access to any data, it's all blind to Doug as its blind to the rest of us. So I don't think there is any concern about Doug's departure other than temporarily we don't have a Head of Clinical Medical Affairs, but as I mentioned we have a very strong team Doug really helped build and we are in the process of searching for a CMO who will lead clinical and medical affairs.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Duncan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that makes sense to me and consistent with my diligence with Dr. Figland and other KOL said [indiscernible], I guess I'm wondering regarding the process for hiring a CMO, are you close, do you haven't identified candidate or is this - when is your goal for having that candidate on board?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so we have a large handful of candidates who are in - sort of the second stage I would say of the process meaning - have been or are on their way to Argos for a second round of interviews and I think we have really strong candidates and certainly would hope to have someone onboard before the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Duncan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then regarding the ADAPT trial, I think you mentioned that the IDMC will be meeting approximately every six months - can you tell me if that is - first of all, is that driven by the number of events or is it really driven by calendar, I understand it's kind of hard to get all these people in the room at one time. Then secondarily, is that every six months or in six months from now or is it every six months and therefore would it be about six months from June when it last meet?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Correct. So, six months from June, so the current plan would be six months, so basically ASCO every year, and then towards the end of the year. And then depending on the number of events, for example, they see the end of this year or towards the end of the year whenever they decide to do the meeting, then they - if for example, approximately 50% events haven't yet occurred by then, they would then likely set a date sometime in first quarter next year which to convene and review at approximately 50% of events. But still, likely has the meeting at ASCO next year because they are all there and take a look.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Duncan</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, that's helpful. And then my final question is regarding tracking how patients are being treated following progression on the control arm. Do you feel pretty comfortable with it? Still, I know we've asked that question a bunch of times before but how do you feel that's going in terms of that and what is the potential for them - those patients going onto another experimental therapy?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Nicolette</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi Charles, this is Charles. Historically with the second and third line treatments that are currently available and approved in this indication, the combination - the order in which they are administered after first line failure but has a relatively uniform outcome which makes it unnecessary to track carefully or stratify for example based on the second and third line in preventions. However, as you mentioned, looking at things that might be in advanced experimental testing in second and third line, we need to be vigilant about whether or not they become widely available and could affect the outcome of the trial. Right now our view is that even if something were to become available it would likely be used relatively, uniformly across that treatment failures or people leave the study in both arms but that remains to be seen whether or not; A, anything does become available before - let's say our - the median for our control arm or standard of care arm reads out, and B, whether or not, in this patient population that we have which people that present with metastatic disease onboard, whether or not these potentially experimental drugs are more effective than the current second and third line standards of care, it remains to be seen when we haven't seen any data on things that are in advanced testing in terms of the impact in this population. Does that answer your question?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Duncan</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it does Charles. Thanks for the added information with the key point of being this particular patient population being not having been studied with some of those other experimental agents. I appreciate that.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Joe Pantginis from ROTH Capital Partners. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joe Pantginis</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey guys, good afternoon, thanks for taking the question. Couple of questions please; first, I guess can you comment on your business development opportunities in other territories and how they might be progressing?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Right, this is Jeff. Thanks, Joe. Yes, so we are continuing to talk to potential partners for all territories, ex-U.S. I can't really comment on exactly where we are - with which territories but we definitely have interest in a number of regions from a number of major Biopharma companies and really it's just balance between what we think the value is now to partner and what kind of values being offered to us. So I think as we go through the study and get through these next syndromes, the discussions will become more interesting but certain regions we may do something sooner and certain regions I think will wait on. But I think there is a lot of interest clearly in what we're doing and we continue to assess the partnering opportunities.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joe Pantginis</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it, that's fair, thanks. And then with regard to expenses, you would expect to see some of the expenses trail off now as the studies fully enrolled, not a lot of expenses with regard to following the patients I would assume but then you would see additional expenses coming on with new studies and your manufacturing, so just trying to get some sort of view on the expenses going forward at will - the Phase 3 coming off be sort of a wash with the additional expenses coming on or should we expect some sort of other slope?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lori Harrelson</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi Joe, this is Lori. And yes, so with the second half of 2015 between the Phase 3 cost which will level off in Q3 and then begin to decrease in Q4 and into 2016, any decrease will be offset with most likely with what we will continue to spend and our commercialization efforts. However, we will continue to be prudent with balancing spending on commercialization and filing our BLA.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joe Pantginis</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. And then housekeeping question on the study, can you remind us what the geographical breakdown is with regard to the enrollment, maybe specifically North America and Europe?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Nicolette</span></strong></p>
<p>It's roughly 85% North America, clinical sites, the majority of those in the U.S. in North America, and 15% or so in Europe, and that includes the Israel and Czech Republic.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joe Pantginis</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. Thanks. No, thanks Charles, and I guess since I have you there, just curious when you think we might see some of the preclinical dataset regarding the HIV PD-1 combo?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Nicolette</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we did enter into an agreement with another company to test the checkpoint inhibitor. So we think we can generate that data probably over the next eight months or so where it will - because we are doing the research plan with materials from patients from our Phase 2b trial. We can actually - we're actually testing it in patients but invitro. And I think we can generate a very strong dataset on whether or not it would make sense to think about a combination in the clinic.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Joe Pantginis</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, aright, thanks a lot guys.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Joe.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Tom Schrader from Stifel. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tom Schrader</span></strong></p>
<p>Good afternoon. Just wondering if you could dig in a little bit more to the cash burn, it looks like you have about $40 million and you're spending about $20 million a quarter, so what can we expect to change?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Lori Harrelson</span></strong></p>
<p>Tom, some of that is around our - a lot of that actually is around our commercialization efforts between commercial manufacturing, as well as our facility, we have spent some related to that. As far as the facility goes, we currently estimate the facility to cost approximately $50 million. We have recently gone out to general contractors that bid on the build out of the facility so we will have more fine estimates after they are received. We are currently in discussions with developers and potential lenders with this type of capital investment. And hopefully we'll expect to have a deal in the near terms, we can complete our facility in mid-2016 and stay on-track with our plans for our BLA filings.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tom Schrader</span></strong></p>
<p>So would you slow work on that facility in order to guarantee approximately a year of cash?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so I think Tom, you are forgetting to add in the money that Lummy is expected to invest in the first part of next year in the terms we have. So we actually have over $50 million of cash, so even on our aggressive plan to stay on-track with commercialization as Lori explained, we can get to the middle of next year. But obviously, as Lori said, that depends on the financing of the facility which as you said we're working on deal firms before as we speak. And then obviously we need to think about balancing that with moving forward on the other stuff and staying well capitalized and thinking about our financing strategy on top of that but first we are going to get clarity on the facility financing and the capital needs that will be hopefully assumed by someone else for that and then we can focus on our financing strategy for us.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tom Schrader</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And next question I got to ask, so do you see anything like what you saw in Phase 2, what's the chance the trial has stopped for the next - if you really see a threefold increase in OS, would that stop the trial? And the second question is, could they stop on intermediate only patients realize that's a huge benefit to these patients and stop on the basis of that only, is that -</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the signal would have to be extraordinarily strong in order to stop at either the 50% or the 75% of events. It's not out of the question that it could happen but remember, we're using the Obrien Fleming boundary method of analysis, specifically the low into midst variation on that which means at the first interim the P-value required to stop the trial would - is unbelievably small and it only wretches us a little bit with each subsequent analysis. This method is very much preferred over, for example, the Bonferroni method, because it limits to almost nothing of the outer spend that we're dealing with. So to answer your question, it's possible but it would have to be an extraordinarily clear signal for that to happen. If we were in fact approximating what we saw in the Phase 2 study, that might actually qualify but we have to wait and see.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tom Schrader</span></strong></p>
<p>[Cross talks] Just if I could, to stop at the next time or to stop at Phase 3 you would have to approximate the Phase 2 data?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>I think I would say it's 75% of events.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Nicolette</span></strong></p>
<p>And just to be clear on discussion with Charles Duncan, a follow-up on the IDMCs role, they put you - when they have that review at approximately 75% of events, they don't have to wait to meet again for six months to look at what would be 100% events. They could choose to meet at some point sooner if they saw a significant improvement, so that's a possibility as well. The question on intermediate [ph], I don't think that's a possibility but we believe by the tweaks we made to the Phase 3 in eliminating the five and six respective patients who at Fortress and changing the dosing regimen so that you dose through progression and you're dosing combination with subsequent therapies beyond Sutent, we actually expect to have - if not quite as dramatic as a three-fold doubling and intermediate, we certainly expect to do much better in the pore than we did in Phase 2. So we don't think it will be so lopsided in Phase 3.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tom Schrader</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then last quick question, it sounds like you found the PD-1 part or PD-L1 partner but it remains unnamed, is that accurate?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>For the HIV?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tom Schrader</span></strong></p>
<p>Right.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, we're working on in announcement with them and we hope to have something out as soon as possible. It's just - let's blame it on the lawyers.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Tom Schrader</span></strong></p>
<p>That's great, that's exciting. Thank you very much.</p>

<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Eric Ekland from JMP Securities. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Ekland</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi guys, thanks for taking my call, congratulations on the progress you've made. Most of my questions have been answered at this point, I just have one sort of follow-up question on the adjuvant study. What exactly is - how different is the standard of care that's going to be provided versus current standard of care? So by having the patient to be extra five weeks before having the surgery, how different is that from the current standard of care? What sort of controls do you have for that study, so how are you going to know if any infiltrate or inflammation that can differs the norm and what sort of an outcome are you looking for to decide whether to follow-up in that population?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Nicolette</span></strong></p>
<p>This is Charles, I can address some of your questions. First, in this early stage, [indiscernible] setting the normal standard of care for the patient is to simply undergo a curative nephrectomy with no drug treatment and those patients will survive quite a long time if they present with relatively minimal disease. So the challenge of course is getting people to agree to join the trial and also agree to have a delay in the surgery after diagnosis. So the physician running the trial is actually selecting patients who would not be adversely affected by that way. And we are seeing accrual to the study, so this is doable. But what is the real purpose of this study, because these patients live so long and we are just including 10 patients in the study, it's - we're not powered to see any effect in terms of clinical outcomes, but what we will be able to do is demonstrate, number one, that we can make the product from a needle biopsy from the tumor, treat the patient, and then after the patient has the nephrectomy we will be able to determine whether or not these memory T-cells that our product induces have infiltrated the tumor. So we can - from the biopsy, and comparing to the primary tumor after treatment, it allows us to get a foreign after picture of what's happening in the tumor environment. So that's something that we were excited to look at, to confirm more of the mechanism of action that we've already articulated in the peripheral blood.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Eric Ekland</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thank you very much for taking my question.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Our next question comes from the line of Chad Messer from Needham. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chad Messer</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking my question. You've covered a lot of ground but I just wanted to ask you, I mean, you gave us an update on PD-1 and HIV, just want to know your thoughts on some kind of combination in oncology with 003, it seems like an obvious thing to be interested in looking at.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. And not surprisingly, we are obviously very interested in looking at that and we're exploring the possibility of doing that in a number of different settings. The trick is, where the PD-1s are approved right now are not settings that are - they are basically second and third line after a multiple failures which do not have a great spot for us to start in, let's say, lung cancer for instance and likely to be where they end up in bladder for instance. And we don't have a strong interest in melanoma to be on us. However, I think the first opportunity for us is likely to be in RCC and we're working with an investigator who is also - he is working with one of the owners of one of the PD-1s to design a proof-of-concept study in RCC, combining AGS-003 with PD-1. So that's in the works, our protocol is being finalized and ready to submit to both us and the other company and so we'll see where that lands. I think we're still at least a month or two away from knowing but I think that's our first opportunity. In the meantime we'll go into bladder and lung as I mentioned, and continue to think about how best we could combine with PD-1 in one of those or potentially in other indication but it's something Charles is spending a lot of his time thinking about.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Charles Nicolette</span></strong></p>
<p>And just to briefly mention the rationale behind combining AGS-003 with a checkpoint inhibitor, we are really combining two different mechanisms of action even though they are both immune modulators. For example, AGS-003, what correlates with clinical outcome is the newly created anti-tumor T-cells. And the checkpoint inhibitors reactivate pre-existing T-cells. So being able to attack the tumor from/by both reactivation, as well as inducing new anti-tumor immunity makes a lot of sense to me.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chad Messer</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, I mean the combination is very exciting. Thanks for your update of what you're thinking there about that's the luck as we grind for these interims towards the end of the year Phase 3 study.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jeff Abbey</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Chad.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions] And that looks like all the questions that were going to be getting in the queue for today, so I'd like to turn the call back over to management for closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Jeff Abbey</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. As always, I'd like to express our appreciation to the patients, their families and the doctors for participating in our clinical trials. Thanks everyone for your attention today and we look forward to reporting our progress on our next call.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen thank you again for your participation in today's conference. This now concludes the program, and you all disconnect your telephone lines at this time. Everyone have a great afternoon.</p>
