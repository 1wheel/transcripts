<p><strong>Ronald Pantin</strong></p>
<p>Good morning, everyone. In the second quarter presentation, you will see that even in the low-price environment, Pacific Rubiales was able to maintain production at record levels and reduce costs and increase netbacks significantly and position the Company for the future.</p>
<p>In the second quarter, we have an average of $58 per barrel WTI. That is an increase of 21% I'm sorry, of 19% over the first quarter of this year. Our production stayed at the same level of the first quarter of 152,400. That is 2% higher than in the year to year and stable with the last quarter, as I mentioned before. Revenue generation was 700 million, 703 million. That's a 12% decrease compared to the first quarter that's due to sold volumes. We have also higher prices, but lower sold volumes. EBITDA went up 14% compared to the first Q of this year. Funds flow from operations were 168 million, that's 7% increase over the first quarter of 2015.</p>
<p>We had a record on the total combined operating cost with a decrease of 21% compared to the first quarter of this year. And also, we have a $33 per barrel of oil equivalent operating netback that is 44% higher than the first quarter of this year, as you well know that Alfa/Harbour requested to terminate with no further obligations to the Company. The offer that they have made at $6.50 per share of the -- to acquire 100% of the shares. The net production for the Company, we have gone up from-- in the year to year 2% and from 149,000 to 152,000 but, something to remark is that Rubiales field have gone from 63,000 barrels per day to 55,000 barrels per day in the second quarter. That's in the second quarter of last year, of 2014, we have 42%, Rubiales was 42% of the Company. And now, it's 36%. That was replaced by light crude oil that it was 49,000 in the second Q of 2014 and now, it's 56,000 barrels per day second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Right now, light medium oil is 37%. And last year, in the second quarter of last year, was 33%. So, we have been replacing the production of Rubiales with light/medium oil and also with increase in other heavy oil fields. We can see here that, since the sliding prices back in -- started in October of last year, we reached around from $40 to $60 WTI [indiscernible] at the-- in the first quarter, it went down to around 43, 44. The second quarter, it went up pretty close to 60. And now, it's back to in the order of $43, $44 WTI. The Company is selling more or less at the realization price for oil, is very close to WTI, as I have to remind you that we sell at Brent, but we have a discount of around $6 to Brent. That has been more or less the differential between Brent and WTI.</p>
<p>Our sales, the cargos went mainly to the USA. 54% of our exports went to the USA, 34% to Asia, and 12% to Latin America. In this quarter, we have our volumes sold were lower than in the last quarter by almost 3 million barrels. That's due to cargos into the third quarter and also to changes in inventory. But, one very important thing is that we have changed our sales from Castilla blend that is 18 degrees API to now more Vasconia blend that is 24 degrees API. You can see in the graph that we were selling Vasconia. 32% of our production was Vasconia. And now, it's very close to 80%. The idea to that is we have to increase the sales, the margins that because we have a differential of over $3 Vasconia to Castilla.</p>
<p>The very good news for the Company is what we have achieved in reducing the total operation cost. You can see here that, in the second quarter of the last year, we had $32 per barrel. And in this quarter, we are reporting 21% -- $21, I'm sorry. And that's 34% lower than in the year to year and a very impressive 22% decrease between the first quarter and the second quarter of this year. Netbacks, you can see that netbacks have been coming down with oil prices. In the second quarter of last year, we have $100 oil prices. And for this quarter, we have $55. But, we can see that we have maintained around 60% cash operating margin and that the netbacks have grown from $22 to $33. That's a very impressive 50% increase from quarter to quarter. That's due to better prices, went from 50 to 55 but, more important than that, a reduction in cost from 20, very close to $28 to $22 in oil netback.</p>
<p>Total cost improvement; we have here a graph where you have all the details on how we have been reducing costs. The first is the production cost. The production cost, we have gone from $198 million in the first quarter of 2014 to $107 million in the second quarter of 2015. That is a 46% reduction in absolute terms.</p>
<p>In the case of production, you can see that, if we compare that using sold volumes or volume sold, you see that we have gone from $15 to $8.90 in this quarter. But, when we see that based on produced barrels, we have gone from 14.77 to 7.82. It's more or less a reduction of 47% when we compare that with production volumes that are more stable than volumes sold. In the case of transportation, we went down from $176 million in the first quarter of 2014 to $156 million this year. And when we see this is a difference of a reduction of 12%, but very important, when we see again this based on produced barrels, we have gone from the $13.17 per barrel of oil equivalent to 11.25. So, it's a 15% reduction from last year. And we have a 6% reduction from this year, the first quarter.</p>
<p>Diluent cost in absolute terms, it was $34 million last year, in the first quarter of last year, and this year is $23 million. And that is a reduction of 32%. When we compare that in volumes produced, we went from 2.55 in the first quarter of last year to 1.84 in the first quarter of this year to 1.64. So, we have a decrease of 36% in a year-to-year basis. One very important thing also is G&amp;A. The G&amp;A was $75 million in the first Q of 2014 and now is 51 million. That is a reduction of 32% in one year. And when you see that again based on produced volumes, you see that we have gone from 5.61 in the first quarter to $4 in the first quarter of this year to 3.72 in the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>Now, I'm going to be talking about the rest of the year. By the way, in this graph, you see the first cargo that we received in Puerto Bahia. Now, we have received a Suezmax with 1.2 million barrels of capacity. And the port is fully operational. One very important thing for the rest of the year is our hedging policy. Actually, for this quarter, for the third quarter, we have 137,000 barrels hedged. That's 96% of our 3Q estimated oil production, for sure excluding natural gas. And that is at a price of $55 for WTI and very close to $63 for Brent. So, this-- right now all these low oil prices that we are having at this moment are not affecting the Company.</p>
<p>For the fourth quarter, we have 8.7 million barrels. That is around 66% of our production hedge at $57 WTI as a floor and very close to $61 in Brent. Another important strategy is the spinoff of noncore assets. As you know, we sold 5% of OCENSA last year. We have been selling Pacific Midstream. First, we sold 36% working interest to the IFC for 240 million. And now, we are in a process that is very well advanced to sell the remaining 64%. Using the valuation of the IFC, we have a range between 425 million to 475 million. We expect to close this at the end of the third quarter, beginning of the fourth quarter.</p>
<p>Then the important asset that we have is Puerto Bahia. That's Pacific Infrastructure, where we will be selling our 41% working interest. The ranges that we have is between 325 and 375. And we expect to sell that in the first half of next year. We are also looking into the selling the assets in Papua New Guinea. We have a new discovery that Jose Francisco's going to give you some details about it. If we can see a snapshot of the year, we see that, in the first quarter, we beat the guidance that we had for oil prices. It was 45. For the second quarter, we also beat that. It was $50 in our guidance. And as you know, the WTI averaged very close to $58. And now, in the third quarter, we have 55. And we-- up to now, we are in a range from 51 to 55. Average production, we said that, from 150,000 to 156,000 barrels of oil equivalent. We beat that in the first quarter and the second quarter. And now, we are more or less producing at the same level. So, we are ahead, or we are in the range of the average production for this year.</p>
<p>The combined realization price, as I mentioned, we are selling oil at WTI. And natural gas, for sure, the combined is slower because natural gas reduces the combined realization price. In the first quarter, we have 49.45. That was due to hedge. In the second one, very close to 54. And now, we are looking at $55 WTI for the hedge that we have but, then the combined is between 51 and 52 due to natural gas prices. The total operating cost, we had it between $24 and $26 per barrel of oil equivalent. In the first quarter, we have 26.72. We reduced in the second quarter to $21. And that's almost $6 below. And in this year to date, we are more or less in the same range around $22 to $23 year to date.</p>
<p>One very important thing is CapEx. As I mentioned before, we have been able to maintain production at record levels. And we have spent in half of the year 37% of our CapEx. So, we expect to reduce significantly the CapEx this year and being able-- maintaining the production, as I mentioned, at the levels that we have right now between 152,000 and 154,000 barrels per day. Let me talk about something that is very important for the Company. That is the debt profile at June 30 of this year. But, before, I'm going to be talking about the extraordinary income and uses that we have had. As you know, we had the initial funds from the revolving, that we withdrew $1 billion. We paid $484 million on short-term debt. So, we don't have any debt until 2000-- the end of 2016. So, we were left with $516 million that I still keep for the future.</p>
<p>Then we are selling at this moment Pacific Midstream. We expect to receive around 450 million in there. But, Petroelectrica de los Llanos is going to pay Pacific Rubiales 100 million. That is debt that-- shareholders' debt that Petroelectrica de los Llanos have with Pacific Rubiales, this have a double effect. One, we will receive 100 million. But, now that the debt is not going to be in the head of Pacific Rubiales, our total debt will be reduced in 100 million as well. Then as I mentioned, the first semester of next year, we expect to sell Pacific Infrastructure. And that will be in the order of $350 million more. So, by the end of the year, I mean by next year, after we sell Pacific Infrastructure, we will have in the order of $1.4 billion in cash. We'll be using -- we'll use that to reduce debt. And that will reduce our net debt from the, let's say right now, $4.8 billion to 3.8 net debt for next year after we sell these noncore assets.</p>
<p>Now, I'm going to pass the word to Jose Francisco that is going to go through the exploration results.</p>
<p><strong>Jose Francisco</strong></p>
<p>Good morning to everybody. Despite the significant reduction on the exploration budget that we have this year, the CapEx allocated for exploration went down from over $500 million last year to $134 million this year. We are on track with our exploratory drilling campaign with an 82% success rate so far. The drilling program for this year consisted of 17 exploration and appraisal well of which eight wells were really in the first quarter. During this second quarter, we drilled successfully three wells, one in Colombia in the Corcel block, the Espadarte-2 well. That was successfully. We found 12 feet of net pay. And we're presently actually preparing to test the well.</p>
<p>In Peru, in Block 131, we drilled the Los Angeles 2 well very successfully. We found 81 feet of net pay. And the well is under standard production tests with the average flow of 2,500 barrels of light oil per day. In Brazil, we drilled the last well of the three-wells campaign that was planned for this year. The Echidna-1 well was also very successfully. We found 341 meters of -- sorry, feet of net pay. And the well tested close to 4,500 barrels of oil per day.</p>
<p>We are presently with our partners in these blocks [indiscernible] preparing to submit a developing plan to the Brazilian Hydrocarbon Agency in order to convert the contingent resources that we reported at the end of last year into reserves.</p>
<p>During the third quarter, we had three wells in progress, which I would like to report to you, two in Colombia, in the Guatiquia block, the Ceibo-2 wells, which was drilled. IT reached DD. And we found 84 feet of net pay. And we are presently preparing the well for completion. In the Corcel block, we drilled the Zural-1 exploratory well. And the well tested 650 barrels of oil per day, opening new area for appraisal wells and for developing wells in this new zone in the Corcel block. And finally, in Papua New Guinea, we're drilling with our parents InterOil the Triceratops-3 well. The well is almost reaching a final depth, but we have found very good gas shows over a gross column close to 150 meters, which is indicating that the well is going to be very, very successful.</p>
<p>And now, I'll give the word to our Chief Financial Officer Carlos Perez, who is going to discuss with you the financial results.</p>
<p><strong>Carlos Perez</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Jose Francisco, and good morning, everyone. Revenues decreased to 203 million from the first quarter of 2015, due mainly to a lower volume sold. This is a result of timing of cargo shipments. This was offset by more than $4 increase in the average combined sales price during the quarter. As Ronald mentioned, we had better prices. There was an increase in the oil market of about $4 in average.</p>
<p>Average of oil and gas sales for the second quarter were 143,000 barrels per day, 20% lower than the first quarter. The number was 180,000 barrels per day. And this reduction, as I said, it was a timing of cargo shipments. Adjusted EBITDA was $307 million, 14% higher when comparing with the prior quarter, due to the higher margins, as Ronald explained before, and because we had lower operating costs and combining with the increase in the oil prices. Funds flow from operations increased from 157 million to 169 million, giving us enough funds to be used for CapEx of the period, of the quarter. As you know, we have the policy of matching CapEx with the cash generation.</p>
<p>Also, it contributed to something where I think it's very important, an important reduction in the working capital, the negative working capital. We started with $900 million. And at the end of the second quarter, we had $124 million negative working capital, a significant reduction in that figure. Net losses from operations improved when comparing with the prior quarter from 139 to 102, an improvement of 24%. Combined operating netback on oil and gas for the second quarter this year was $32.64 per barrel, 43% higher than the 22.73 per barrel of oil equivalent in the prior quarter. This significant increase in-- was attributable to the reduction, as I said, in the total operating cost as well as the impact of higher realized prices.</p>
<p>Net loss for the second quarter of 2015 was $226 million, attributable to the impact of noncash items as risk management, expenses, all realized foreign exchange losses and the DD&amp;A. As you know DD&amp;A is the most important [measure] for the Company. Half of this number in DD&amp;A is represented by Rubiales. As you know, Rubiales has an expiry date in June 2016. And now, we are amortizing faster the number. We have the remaining amount, which is about $0.5 billion during the rest of the months we have Rubiales in our portfolio.</p>
<p>When comparing the total losses, there was an improvement comparing with this $722 million we had in the prior quarter. And this-- the main reason of this is we didn't have any impairment during the quarter. And we are not expecting to have in coming quarters that type of impairment.</p>
<p>Now, we continue with the Q&amp;A.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions]. And your first question comes from a line of Nathan Piper with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Piper</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good morning. I wonder if I ask you about your shareholder base. Following the Alfa Harbor transaction that determination of that transaction, I guess your shareholder base has changed quite considerably. And I wondered how the-- your quality of interaction is with your largest shareholders following the deal termination.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we have been talking to our shareholders, especially to our larger shareholders. We normally do that. And it's very positive. And actually, they are all in line with our plans. And -- but, I think the relation with our main shareholders is very good.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Nathan Piper</span></strong></p>
<p>So, equally good with all of them? Through the deal process the Alfa/Harbor offer, there were quite contrasting views on the business, they well know come into line?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>We have talked to them separately. And they're aligned with the plans of the Company.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from a line of Sebastian Gallego from Credit Core Capital. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sebastian Gallego</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good morning. Thanks for the presentation. I have two questions. One is regarding the 150 million that you guys mentioned that you received as a partial prepayment. I want to know, where is this cash at the moment in the balance sheet? So far, I don't see it. And the second question is regarding the two production assets you may sell. Which of the assets are you talking about because you mentioned Papua New Guinea, but it seems there are further production assets that you're willing to sell? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Perez</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, regarding your first question, you can see in the financials, in the balance sheet, you can see the second line in the current liabilities, the deferred revenue. And that amount is including the $150 million. So, as you know, this is an agreement with BP in order to solidate the [lesser], the cash generation to be used for different reasons for financing the operations and CapEx. And we received that funds. We are going to pay-- we have three months' grace period. And we're starting paying in October. The number or the amount to be amortized is $20 million, $25 million per month. That is the agreement we have with BP.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>And as you mentioned, Papua New Guinea asset, we are now very active on that after this discovery. And for the rest is some marginal oil fields that we're looking to that to a spinoff of those assets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sebastian Gallego</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Just a follow up on the first question because you guys had already the deferred revenue account on the liabilities side as of the first quarter. But, the MD&amp;A says you actually received the 150 million. So, from what I understand is that you received that in cash, but I actually don't see it. And the cash position over the quarter has decreased by 135 million. So, I'm just wondering where is this money, the 150 million?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Perez</span></strong></p>
<p>Let me clarify because we close the agreement in June, but we received the money in July. In July, we received the money. That is the reason you don't see it. But, that is a subsequent event. And it's not affecting the numbers of the second quarter. Yes, that is the main reason. But, it's going to be included in the same line, yes, in the same line. Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sebastian Gallego</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you because the MD&amp;A said this quarter. Thank you for the clarification, though.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from line of Luiz Carvalho, HSBC. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Luiz Carvalho</span></strong></p>
<p>Morning, guys. Thanks for the call. There are potentially two questions here. The first one is the regarding litigation that Ecopetrol [indiscernible] payment in rather in cash rather than oil, whether that should be accommodated and recalculated at market prices corresponding to the dates, which [indiscernible] generated. So, I just would like to understand what will be the potential impact from this process. And second, also, Ecopetrol mentioned that they were starting to actually, to make some drilling in Rubiales field. I just would like to understand how this could impact from here into 2016 on another year. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Luiz, the communication is not very good with you. Really, can you go slower, please? Can you repeat the question? Sorry for that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Luiz Carvalho</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, can you hear me now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, but there is still a lot of noise around you. So, please go slow, and for sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Luiz Carvalho</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So, the first question is about a potential litigation with Ecopetrol regarding the payment and the cash rather in oil from Rubiales field. There was some news in the press this week talking about a potential evaluation in the -- let's say that the amount should be recalculated at market prices corresponding to the dates on which they were generated. So, I just would like to understand how -- what will be the impact from this recalculation. And the second question, it's about Rubiales field. During the Ecopetrol conference call, they mentioned that they started to actually perform some drilling on your field. I just would like to understand, from now until year 2016, what will be the impact from this drilling and if you actually have to participate with them, spend some cash in this as well. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. Okay. First on the PAP, as you know, we have that is not in Rubiales that is in Quifa. And we have an arbitration process that everything is really in line what the arbiter said. And so, we paid that in kind. We pay barrels. And right now, we have been working with a new PAP since the resolution of the arbitration process came out. But, there was a noise that we talked to Ecopetrol last week when it came out in the press. But, really, I don't see that. And actually if it's, that is the case, it will be a very small amount. It will be in the order of $13 million. But, I really don't see it. Then on the oil, in the agreement that we have with Ecopetrol to drill new wells, it was 62 new wells. The wells are behaving okay. And they're paying 30%, but we're gaining -- they're paying 70%. We're getting -- paying 30%, but we're getting 50% of the production. And that's going well. And that's why Rubiales has been able to keep its production at the same level of 163,000, 164,000 barrels per day gross.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Youe next question comes from the line of Jamie Somerville, TD Securities. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jamie Somerville</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. Thanks. I'm wondering, can you clarify what's the range of API gravity that you're getting from the Corcel area, in particular the newer well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jose Francisco</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Jamie, the gravity that we have in there is in the order of 24 API degree.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jamie Somerville</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And then moving on, on some questions on the midstream assets, congratulations on getting the port facility done. And I like the fact that you're looking to sell most of your or all of your interests in these assets to clean up the balance sheet. I'm just wondering, anything you can give us to provide us with greater certainty that these transactions are actually going to proceed in particular with regards to the Pacific Midstream one that you're indicating can close by late this quarter or early next quarter in terms of who the counterparty is and how that can be structured. Is-- are those indicated ranges of valuation actually likely to show up as cash on your balance sheet, as you are indicating, or are there any other liabilities or further capital commitments within these that would reduce those amounts?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, the process is very well advanced. We have been doing that for almost two months now. We have three candidates at this moment. They have-- they are going through due diligence. And we expect to have an offer probably in the next 60 days. And the thing is going well. The numbers that you saw in the presentation are based on the IFC transaction. And it's more or less in valuation. But, again, we expect to receive-- it's a cash transaction. And we expect to receive that probably in the next-- well, to close in 60 days. And then the cash will be before the end of the year.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Magash Chetty from BlueBay Asset Management. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Magash Chetty</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, good afternoon. Just a couple quick questions. Just in terms of the working capital and income tax payments through the cash flow, can we expect a similar level in kind of Q3 and Q4 because it's been 257 million in working capital outflow in Q1, 71 million in Q2? Would that continue to be negative into Q3 and Q4, or will it slow down and be lower? And in terms of the tax payment, 50 million in the second quarter, can we expect a similar amount in Q3 and Q4? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Perez</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we have reported an estimate for the year of about $100 million. That includes income tax and the wealth tax. Both of them are included in that figure. Of course, there are sometimes some concentration in one of the quarters, as it happened in the second quarter. So, that is our best estimate we have. We are not expecting to have an increase. Regarding the working capital, we are expecting to have a number close to neutral. As Ronald explained, we have hedges protecting our revenues. So, in the third quarter, we have a floor of over --it's over $55. And we're expecting to have at least these $55 per barrel, regardless whatever is the price market. And in the fourth quarter, we-- as was explained by Ronald, we have more than 60% protected as well. So, at the end, we are expecting to have a number according to our guidance. So, that is what we are expecting, regardless as I said the oil market. So, we don't see in our projections, because of that, having different number.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Magash Chetty</span></strong></p>
<p>Just to be clear then, in the third quarter and the fourth quarter in terms of working capital, you expect it to be closer to neutral. Is that correct? And then one question, if I may. You are also due to receive 80 million in terms of the asset sale announced in December. Are you still set to receive that 80 million, or that-- has that come in and will be reflected in Q3?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Perez</span></strong></p>
<p>Repeat the question because I couldn't-- hello?</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Magash Chetty</span></strong></p>
<p>Hello?</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Apologies. This is the operator. Are you ready for the next question, or -- ?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Can you repeat the question? We really didn't get it, the -- your last question.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Magash Chetty</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so hi. It's Magash Chetty for BlueBay. Just to clarify, so you're basically saying, in the third quarter and the fourth quarter, you expect working capital to be neutral. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>It is correct, yes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Magash Chetty</span></strong></p>
<p>And then one more -- yes, I had a quick additional question. You closed the asset sale to the IFC in December. And my understanding was there was an additional 80 million to be received. Have you received that cash from the first quarter…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, no. Now, I know what you mean. What happened is that they have a commitment to invest in a gas line $80 million more. But, right-- as you know, we deferred that project. So, we have not received that.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And your next question comes from the line of Daniel Guardiola from LarrainVial. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Daniel Guardiola</span></strong></p>
<p>I have a couple of questions. I'm going to try to keep it brief. First of all, I would like to know if you could please share with us an update regarding CP6 and Rio Ariari. When are you expecting these fields to ramp up and by how much? And my second question is regarding the current litigation dispute you have with the A&amp;H regarding the Corcel block. I'd like to know if you have any update regarding this situation. And how much of the $220 million on the arbitration are already provisioned? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. On the CP6, as you know, that was delayed for the acquisition of Repsol of Talisman by Repsol. And right now, we're getting into terms. We see right now that Repsol has taken the operations here in Colombia. We'll be making a decision what to do, if Repsol wants to go ahead, for sure, we'll do it. It's our partner. But, if not, we will do it in a solo risk. In the case of Rio Ariari, as you know, right now, we have also delayed the project because we have to invest in facilities. As you remember, for heavy oil, we need to build on the water treatment facilities and water disposal facilities. And now, what we have been doing is reducing CapEx to be able to keep our funds flow from operations equal to the CapEx that we have been spending. So, right now, under the present oil scenarios, what we are doing is producing, as I mentioned, at record levels, but we are stopping some of the -- or delaying some of the investment in exploration and also in these heavy oil projects that are massive and from the capital, from the flow in capital.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Jose Francisco</span></strong></p>
<p>Regarding these negotiations with -- regarding the [POP] with the A&amp;H, we continue with friendly talks with the agency. We decided together to suspend any arbitration process. So, we're expecting to reach a negotiation with them and a final amount to be settled. We have in our financial [schemings] a provision of $193 million to cover that. So, we expect that, with that amount, we can cover whatever is the final number to be decided together with A&amp;H.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>But, we think that we have a very solid position on that arbitration process.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Anne Milne from Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anne Milne</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you. Good morning. Very impressive reduction in the costs. My first question relates to, could you quantify what percentage of the reduction in your costs are due to weaker COP and how much are actually costs that have been taken out? Second question is, you have lower-than-estimated CapEx for the first half of the year and, say, EBITDA in line or maybe slightly ahead of at least what we were expecting. Do you think this will remain the case for the second half of the year as well? I know you want to match your CapEx with your cash flow. But, I just at the current rate, it looks like you might be slightly lower CapEx than EBITDA for the year. And then the third question is on the covenant on the Company's net worth. Given the net losses you've had just due to the weaker operating environment, you actually might trigger that with the banks and was wondering if you've thought of how you will address that particular one, the minimum net worth of 1 billion. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>I'm going to answer first the CapEx. We can maintain production at the present levels in the order of $700 million to $800 million a year. And so, again, the rest will be if we have more funds from operation, then we'll decide what to do with that extra money and if we'll increase more our production or if we do some exploration.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Perez</span></strong></p>
<p>So, third question, Anne, as you know, approximately 40% of the total cash operating costs are peso denominated. And approximately 50% of the capital expenditure have exposure to the Colombian peso. So, those are the numbers. Due to these peso devaluations, we've been capturing total number in the range of between 22% to 25% of a total cost reduction. The remaining number for total cost reduction are structural things we are doing in the fields and taking other different measures. And regarding the covenants, our net worth in the financial is $1.4 billion, but because we have some restricted subsidiaries, the number is close to 1.2 billion in the case of the covenants. But, with the sale of the assets, we are expecting to accumulate the figures and probably to go beyond because we will have, with the sales of Pacific Midstream, as Ronald said, more than $400 million plus in the remain also, we are receiving back money from a loan we have to pay by Petroelectrica de los Llanos. So, we are expecting to increase the net worth in $500 million. And next year, we're expecting to sell Pac Infra. So, with that, we think we can mitigate the negative impact of the different things happening in the market. But, remember that, also, we have the hedges to protect this year our revenues and of course, then the bottom line of the Company.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anne Milne</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great. Thanks. Just one clarification. So, on the costs you said I'm sorry. The first number you said was 30% of the costs are-- you said 50% of the costs-- of your operating costs are in Colombian pesos and the rest in dollars. I didn't get the first part, which was 30%, I believe you said.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Perez</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, between-- it's close to 40% because, well, the salaries and most of the contractors are in pesos, 40%. But, of course, we have to use chemicals and all the things that are peso are dollar related. But, 40% is a good number to be used for projections.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anne Milne</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And just from accounting perspective, just a clarification that -- since you brought it up, the hedges, the -- let's say the positive/negative benefit or positively, obviously, it's been of your hedges are implicit in the adjusted EBITDA figures that you report in your financial statements. Is that correct?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Carlos Perez</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, yes, but we have two things here because, when we have the mark to market is included in the line of risk management, it's one of the lines in the profit and loss statement. And when we receive the settlement, it's included in the revenues. The mark to market is in the different line. Okay? That's something to-- important to be kept in mind.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Anne Milne</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. But, the realized gain or loss close to revenues are for cash flow. Okay. Perfect. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And your next question comes from line of Rafael Elias from Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rafael Elias</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning. Thank you for the call. I just had a couple of questions on the shares that Mr. Betancourt has been adding to his holdings. First is, if you know, what is his percentage ownership right now? And second, if he reaches the 20% threshold, is he obligated to make a tender, or is that just an option?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. What we understand and that actually they have-- Mr. Betancourt has around 19%, over 19% right now of the share price. And what happened is that another part of the O'Hara Group went out and they were not acting in concert. And he bought some so he didn't cross the 20% threshold.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rafael Elias</span></strong></p>
<p>But, if he does, if he continues to add and reaches the 20%, is he obligated to make a tender, or is that an option?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, he's obligated to make a tender.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Rafael Elias</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Has he spoken to you about his plans for the Company or his views on the Company?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>We have talked to him. And as I mentioned before, he's aligned with the plans for the Company.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And next question comes from line of Pedro Medeiros from Citigroup. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Pedro Medeiros</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks for taking the questions. Okay. Thanks for taking the questions. Congratulations on the results. I have actually two few very objective questions about two processes you mentioned on the MD&amp;A. The first one is if you can give more guidance on how the contract with Exmar and the offtakers of the LNG, the floating LNG production that was expected to be sold this year, are being treated. Are there any potential liabilities coming from these negotiations? And the second question is if you can elaborate on the shareholding situation of Z-1 in Peru and how the process with your partner could impact your CapEx guidance and your net cash or net debt in Peru. Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Well, in Peru, as you know BPZ went into Chapter 12. And then it was bought by Alfa/Harbor. And right now, they'd be our partner through BPZ. Right now, things are going back to normal in Peru. So, the only difference that we have is that we have the same JOA. But, we will be the official operators. In the past, BPZ was the operator in front of the [government], but now, Pacific Rubiales will be the operator. But, everything is coming back to normality there. The other question was on the LNG. Yes, we have two contracts there, one for regasification that we're selling that to Exmar. We're giving that to Exmar. And for the liquefaction, we're also looking for, to transfer the contract. And we're also very well ahead in the negotiations for those two contracts.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Pedro Medeiros</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And, Ron, just two very quick follow ups. In the transfer of BPZ to Alfa/Harbor, is there any receivable you may get from perhaps CapEx or any cash that you might receive after that transaction concludes? And on the LNG, I understand the part of Exmar. But, is there any need for a negotiation with the offtakers of the LNG production required as well?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. In the case of Peru, BPZ, we'll be receiving $18 million. But, that's going to be probably today. It's something that we're just waiting for the wire transfer. And in the case of the -- we work -- we reached an agreement on the regasification. So, we don't have any cost. And in the case of the liquefaction, we're still working with possible candidates.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Jose Bernal with BBVA. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jose Bernal</span></strong></p>
<p>On the growth strategy in Mexico. And given that there is a specific window opportunity, perhaps the timing is not ideal for the Company. I wonder if Pacific Rubiales will be participating in upcoming bidding process in round one. And if so, what is the status with the JV with Alfa, it's terminated, still in place, effective? Thank you.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>We're very much interested in Mexico. And we have been working on the various fronts. One that we'll be looking at is the shallow water production and also the onshore production. That's coming in September and December and, also, the transfer of service contracts to production sharing. We're working on that. Our joint venture with Alfa still continues. And we see that we're still looking for good opportunities that we see in the near future in Mexico. All those opportunities will not need money for this year. All the cash needs will come for next year.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And your next question comes from the line of Benjamin Hue from BCP. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Benjamin Hue</span></strong></p>
<p>I just wanted to follow up on a previous question about the forward oil sale. In the MD&amp;A, it said that the money, the $100 million, from the second quarter forward oil sale was received on June 30. And as such, my understanding was we that current cash balance as of the end of June 30 reflected that $100 million payment. I was wondering if you could confirm that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, this we have to probably to go back to the first quarter. We received $200 million in the first quarter. In -- of that amount -- out of that amount, there was an amortization of $100 million. And we received in the new facility in two installments, one at the end, the very end of the second quarter, 150 more in July, as I said before. The balance of that is included in the line I mentioned at the beginning of this Q&amp;A session, is in the deferred revenue, is the second line in the current liabilities. That is the reconciliation of the number. Then it's a combination of the first facility and the second facility we have in place.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Benjamin Hue</span></strong></p>
<p>Understood and that deferred revenue line was approximately $200 million at the end of Q1 and just about $200 million at the end of Q2. So, my understanding is you shipped some oil, and you received new cash proceeds during second quarter. just to confirm it.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ronald Pantin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Correct.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Benjamin Hue</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right. Thank you very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>At this time, there will be no further questions. Please go ahead, Mr. Pantin</p>
<p><strong>Ronald Pantin</strong></p>
<p>Okay. As you saw during the presentation, we have been working hard for this lower-price environment. We have been able to reduce costs significantly, actually in OpEx 46% compared to last year, to the second quarter of last year and in G&amp;A 32%. And we think that we still can reduce costs in the second half of the year. CapEx, the CapEx is to match the cash flow while maintaining production. So, we think that we can maintain production between $700 million and $800 million and then that we will be producing more than that in the cash flows. The production that-- we expect the production to increase in this year between 2% and 8% and year to year. We have also changed our recommercialization strategy. </p>
<p>Now that we have more light oil than what we had in the past, remember, in our strategy for-- at the beginning was to increase the diluent. Right now, with that, we can change our blend, commercial blend, to Vasconia from Castilla. And it has between $3 and $5 spread. And right now, we are selling 80% Vasconia, as you know, in last year, we were selling only 30% Vasconia. We are well on the-- in the ahead asset sales, as we mentioned before, Pacific Midstream, 64% of Pacific Midstream, and also our 42% working interest in Pacific Infrastructure.</p>
<p>Hedged, we are in the-- for the third quarter 96% of our production has been hedged of oil production, with a good floor of $55 WTI. And one very important thing is our cash on hand right now is at $724 million at the end of the second quarter of 2015, so we think that we are in a very good position to weather the storm of the lower prices for now. Thank you.</p>
