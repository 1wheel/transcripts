<p>I will now turn the call over to Ben.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Wolin</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Melanie, and thank you all for joining us today. We’re very pleased that we achieved another strong quarter on all fronts. As I always do, let me first provide a quick financial recap. Brian will dig deeper into all the financials later on today’s call.</p>
<p>We delivered total revenue growth of 32% over last year, advertising revenue growth of 36% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 48%. Our strong top and bottom line results are consistent with what we guided back in May. It is clear that our strategy is going deeper with our largest customers are working. Year-over-year revenue growth from our top 30 strategic customers was strong at 41%, and in Q2 our pharma advertising revenue growth was 33% on a year-over-year basis.</p>
<p>Now, let me address a few highlights of the quarter, and why we are pleased with what we are seeing as we execute on our strategy to build the most complete marketing and communications platform for healthcare companies. For the pharma sector, we focused on providing a diverse set of innovative solutions that can service our customer’s entire portfolio: orphan and rare disease brands, specialty pharma and mass-market products as well as late stage for mature brands that are near or even beyond the loss of exclusivity.</p>
<p>We’re seeing progress on all these fronts. Specifically, I’d like to highlight our continued success with unique data-driven solutions like our off-network product health reach, our video solutions and our innovative outcomes based programs for mature brands. In all cases, it is our ability to micro target our audience, optimize across a broad range of assets and provide a compelling ROI oriented solutions that are driving the penetration of these sales solutions.</p>
<p>In Q2, these data-driven products played a key role in the growth of our pharma business and have become increasingly attractive and more efficient replacements for legacy marketing approaches like broadcast TV and a direct sales force. Equally important has been our focus on the orphan and rare disease category. Our acquisition of Cambridge Biomarketing and our continued investment on that front has made us a clear leader in strategic launch and marketing solutions for orphan and rare diseases.</p>
<p>This is $100 billion plus market and is growing more than twice as fast as the overall pharma market. Last year 40% of all drug approvals had orphan designation and the majority of oncology products are orphan products as well. Our solutions here have been very well received and we continue to make progress with premier customers like BioMarin, Alexion, and Intercept.</p>
<p>I’m particularly proud of the progress we are making and expect further success here. In all cases, the ability to provide great marketing and communication solutions is built on a foundation of having the ability to reach consumers and physicians at scale, micro target those audiences and provide them compelling content and engagement solutions.</p>
<p>We see this across all aspects of our business. For example, we engaged with two-thirds of all prescription writing physicians in the U.S., who are extremely active and we have made nice progress in driving in-depth engagements with this key audience. By doing so, we are able to take on an even greater percentage of our customers directed physician marketing budgets. Whether it’s a data-driven solution for specialty pharma, solution for late-stage brands or orphan drugs, the bottom line is our pharma business is doing extremely well. Given the range of services we can offer and a different ways we can work with these customers, we are well positioned for continued growth in our pharma business.</p>
<p>Our growth strategy is not limited to winning in pharma. As we have discussed with you, we see a great opportunity to provide marketing and communication solutions to health insurers and hospital systems and our goal is to win here as well. By leveraging our existing assets, namely our large highly engaged audience, our premium content and tools and our advanced data and analytics capabilities, we can offer health insurers and hospital systems compelling solutions to identify, engage, and influence both consumers and healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>On our last call, we outlined the organic opportunity we see to leverage our, What to Expect Pregnancy, audience to facilitate communication between pregnant women and their insurance companies. Whattoexpect.com is the leading pregnancy and parenting media resource, generating over two million registrations last year. Given that there are about four million total births in the U.S. each year, our digital property has incredible penetration across this valuable audience.</p>
<p>These women also voluntarily share a tremendous amount of information with us. And on average come back to us 17 times a month and a significant percentage of these women register before their 10th week of pregnancy. This means that we typically know these women are pregnant even before their doctor does and long before an insurance company processes the first pregnancy claims, by which point they can be too late to implement effective prenatal care.</p>
<p>We are pleased to announce today a new partnership with Cigna to promote the use of strong prenatal care programs at Cigna. Cigna’s goal in partnering with us is to improve outcomes for pregnant women while reducing pregnancy related healthcare costs. It is estimated that health complications during pregnancy cost payers more than $26 billion annually and we believe through early detection, we can reduce this burden on our healthcare system while also contributing to healthier pregnancies.</p>
<p>We love this offering because of leverages what we are already doing in the pregnancy category to address the critical need for a new customer set. This solution is valuable across the payer landscape and we continue to have productive discussions with other large health insurers. We are also very excited to announce today, our acquisition of Tea Leaves Health, the leading provider of a marketing and analytic CRM to hospital systems to identify and engage consumers and physicians. I’ll review Tea Leaves in much more detail in a few minutes, but we believe this is a large and natural growth opportunity for us.</p>
<p>Hospital systems are now being forced to be much more strategic and how they identify, engage with and market to both consumers and physicians. We have become the market leader in facilitating the same type of interaction between the pharma industry and consumers and we see a great opportunity to do the same for hospital systems across the country. The market for providing hospital systems with marketing and communicating solutions is a large and fast growing market, but still in the very early stages.</p>
<p>We believe that combining Tea Leaves with our existing audience, content and data assets, we can provide hospital systems with a unique full-service ROI-based marketing and communications platform and capitalize on this very significant and largely untapped revenue opportunity. Additionally, we believe Tea Leaves is the best company in this space and we are now the market leader.</p>
<p>As you can see, we are executing on our vision to create the leading digital marketing and communications platform for healthcare marketers. We are winning across pharma, and now with Tea Leaves, we are diversifying our customer base and revenue opportunity into highly complementary and large markets and we are bullish, we will succeed here as well. Now let me turn it over to Brian to review our Q2 performance and after he’s finished I will take you to the Tea Leaves business in more detail.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Cooper</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Ben, and thank you all for joining us today. We delivered solid performance in Q2 and we look forward to continued revenue and EBITDA growth in the second half of the year. In the second quarter, the company achieved total revenue of approximately $55 million, representing year-over-year growth of 32%. Advertising and sponsorship revenue came in at just over $50 million, representing growth of approximately 36% over last year and premium services came in at $4.6 million. These Q2 revenue numbers are right in line with the guidance we provided to you on our Q1 earnings call in May.</p>
<p>In terms of our key revenue drivers, in Q2, we worked with over 200 advertisers and our average revenue per advertiser was approximately $235,000, while we had an increase in the number of customers during the quarter, our strategy to continue focusing on our largest strategic customers remains the same and revenue generated by our top 30 strategic customers grew 41% in the quarter. As Ben mentioned earlier, pharma revenue is our fastest growing category, up 33% on a year-over-year basis, and represented 76% of our total advertising revenue in the quarter.</p>
<p>We are thrilled with this performance that clearly illustrates that our strategy of providing a full service marketing and communications platform is what our customers want. We also saw healthy user engagement in the second quarter. Visits to our three flagship properties increased 13% on a year-over-year basis, and we added over 1.3 million new registrations to our data base.</p>
<p>Moving down to P&amp;L, operating expenses during the second quarter were up versus last year predominantly driven by our acquisitions of DoctorDirectory and Cambridge Biomarketing and includes $3 million charge related to the potential earnout of Cambridge. This charge shows up in sales and marketing and hits the P&amp;L because the payments are contingence on the ongoing employment of key Cambridge executives. We also delivered a number another quarter of profitable growth. Adjusted EBITDA was $10.2 million, a 48% increase over the prior year, and consistent with our expectations and the guidance we provided back in May.</p>
<p>Net income per share on a basic and diluted basis were both approximately $0.05. Please refer to today’s press release, which includes the full reconciliation of GAAP to non-GAAP measures and share count information. With respect to our balance sheet and cash flow, in Q2, cash flow from operations was $8.5 million, which is a 75% improvement over the same period last year and we ended the second quarter with approximately $47 million of cash, outstanding debt of $113 million, and additional borrowing capacity of $37 million. We remain pleased with our ability to continue driving operating leverage and cash flow in our business.</p>
<p>Now let me turn it over to Ben to discuss Tea Leaves.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Wolin</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Brian. Our company is constantly innovated in our category and we are thrilled to add Tea Leaves Health to the stable of solutions that we can now provide to healthcare marketers. We are building a big company and Tea Leaves will be an important component going forward. What is Tea Leaves? Tea Leaves Health is the leading software-as-a-service marketing and analytics CRM for hospital systems to identify and engage consumer and physicians.</p>
<p>Before getting into the Tea Leaves business model, let me first tell you why we decided to invest our capital into this dynamic business. As we have discussed in the past, the changing regulatory and economic healthcare environment has resulted in major changes in the way the hospitals operate. The trends towards value-based care and the shifting of the healthcare cost burden towards consumers has put the consumers squarely at the center of care.</p>
<p>Health systems, arguably all healthcare stakeholders have put little effort toward engaging the consumer historically. We believe we are in the early stages of a major systemic transformation of the healthcare system. Well, we’ll emerge as a new consumerization model that Everyday Health has been building towards for a decade. To-date we have seen substantial success, facilitating pharma’s interaction with consumers, and we are now pointing our assets towards hospitals, who just like pharma and other healthcare constituents, have been forced to become much more strategic and how they identify market to and engage with consumers and physicians.</p>
<p>According to third-party market data, hospitals now spend approximately $2 billion per year marketing to consumers and physicians and that number is growing at a compound annual growth rate of 16%. On top of that media spend, hospitals are spending large sums on the systems required to execute those market and communications programs. Most important just like any other marketer, these hospital systems want the ability to measure whether their marketing dollars worked. Whether it’s for generating profitable new patients, retaining existing patients, influencing what physicians refer their patients or controlling costs, a significant and relatively untapped opportunity exists to help hospitals address these marketing challenges. Tea Leaves perfectly addresses this opportunity and is a market leader in the category.</p>
<p>Why is Tea Leaves a key strategic partner for hospitals? Tea Leaves provides hospitals with a very sophisticated software platform to identify and engage with both patients and physicians. By using this platform, a hospital system can better drive its growth strategy and generate profitable revenue. Their solution starts by combining third-party data with the hospitals first party data to identify high value consumers and healthcare professionals. The Tea Leaves platform then allows a hospital system to engage those consumers and healthcare professionals through segmented and micro targeted digital and print campaigns.</p>
<p>Finally, the Tea Leaves platform using the proprietary data of its customers provides ROI analytics to measure the efficacy of all marketing campaigns executed through their platform. To help better illustrate what Tea Leaves Health does? Let me provide an example of a current customer and how they are using the Tea Leaves solution to address a key strategic initiative. A large medical center in Texas utilized Tea Leaves to help identify and to drive new cardiology patients into the system.</p>
<p>By combining large volumes of third-party data as well as previous electronic medical patient data from that hospital system, Tea Leaves enable the medical center to intelligently target and market the potential patients based on segmentation factors such as payer distribution, EMR history, claims history, purchase history and behavioral data. This micro segmentation and marketing campaign resulted in a great ROI in excess of 10 to 1.</p>
<p>And this is just one example, Tea Leaves Health is providing similar types of strategic solutions to leading hospital systems across the country including premier national and regional health systems such as Advocate Healthcare, University Health Systems and Christus Health. We acquired Tea Leaves Health for four main reasons. First, the provider market represents a new and large growth opportunity for the Company. Over $2 billion has spent annually by hospital systems on patient and physician marketing and Tea Leaves Health is at the forefront of this market.</p>
<p>Second, Tea Leaves already has a premier customer base. They have approximately dozen signed hospital systems typically for multi-year agreements, which represents over 250 individual hospitals. In addition, Tea Leaves has a robust pipeline that should lead to rapid growth in the future. Third, Tea Leaves has an industry-leading technology solutions sold in a SaaS based recurring revenue model, which provides a high degree of visibility into their business. And forth, we believe we can accelerate the growth of Tea Leaves by leverage our existing capabilities and assets.</p>
<p>Let me elaborate on how our assets can drive Tea Leaves growth. As we have mentioned on previous calls, up until this point, we had already been making real progress with hospitals by providing marketing services for patient acquisition. We currently work with over 100 individual hospitals and approximately 25% of Tea Leaves customers, our preexisting EverydayHealth customers, representing great cross-selling opportunities.</p>
<p>By combining marketing services with CRM in one combined solution, we can accelerate both the Tea Leaves SaaS-based revenue and the marketing services that work in conjunction with that SaaS-based service. I also believe we will get leverage beyond sales by combining our content, data, and audience assets with the Tea Leaves solution. For example, a hospital that wants to grow its maternity and pediatric services can identify pregnant women and new parents. Use our content and communications and reach those women across multiple channels including EverydayHealth large digital audience.</p>
<p>Similarly that hospital could identify a population of healthcare professionals to drive referrals and communicate with those HCPs through the MedPage Today’s site and mobile applications. Finally, we see long-term potential in using the Tea Leaves CRM, not just for health system, but for our other customers as well. In summary, Tea Leaves is a great standalone solution and will get even better as we invest behind that team and layer in Everyday Health assets to take advantage of the huge opportunity in healthcare.</p>
<p>Before turning it over to Brian to discuss the overall financials as well as the impact of Tea Leaves, I think it is important to remind everyone of the overall vision for our business. To put it simply, our mission is to build the leading digital marketing and communications platform for healthcare marketers, who want to engage with consumers or healthcare professionals. We have done several deals since going public, each one fits perfectly into executing on this vision and we will continue to be aggressive in the marketplace if we see other opportunities to accelerate that growth.</p>
<p>Our customers all have the same basic objectives. They need to identify and understand whom to reach, they need the ability to access that target audience. They need creative assets and constant to engage that audience and finally they need the data and analytics to optimize and measure the impact of the programs they execute. Its the complete solution that our customers demand and that we strive to provide.</p>
<p>Everyday Health can address these demands through our assets. Including our audience over 60 million consumers and two-thirds of all U.S. prescribers are rich in deep content expertise, our advanced analytics and now our customer relationship management platform from Tea Leaves. Our leading digital marketing and communications platform for healthcare companies is unique, growing, and profitable.</p>
<p>We can help orphan drug manufacturers bring their products to market, mature brands more efficiently commercialize, insurance companies early identify and better manage high risk pregnancies, pharma brand target their potential customers through efficient TV like solutions, and hospital systems drive new patient volume. We are building a very big business and we are extremely excited about our future.</p>
<p>Now, let me turn it over to Brian.</p>
<p><strong>Brian Cooper</strong></p>
<p>Thanks. Ben. Tea Leaves opens up a new and exciting set of customers for Everyday Health and leverages our core competencies to deliver ROI-based marketing programs for hospital systems looking to communicate with consumers and healthcare professionals.</p>
<p>Let me provide a few key metrics about Tea Leaves, which reinforce our enthusiasm for the strong strategic move. As of June 30, Tea Leaves had two dozen customers sign some multiyear agreements that averaged $300,000 per year in annual subscription licensing fees, which translates to approximately $7 million in contracted annual recurring revenue. Because their solution takes about 4 to 6 months to deploy, approximately 60% of those customers are currently live and end market providing a high degree of visibility into the Tea Leaves business.</p>
<p>Tea leaves has quickly established a solid customer base and we are very excited about their current pipeline of customer activity and believe we can at least double this customer base and contracted revenue between now and the end of 2016. Given the growth opportunity in this very large market, we anticipate augmenting our provider sales, marketing, technology, and account management capabilities.</p>
<p>As SaaS-based acquisitions are typically subject to fair value adjustments to deferred revenues, we anticipate that the acquisition of Tea Leaves will be immaterial to our full year 2015 revenue and dilutive to our full-year adjusted EBITDA by approximately $3 million. We completed the acquisition of Tea Leaves for $30 million of which $15 million was paid in cash on closing, $4 million of common stock was put into escrow, and $11 million will be paid within six months of closing in either cash or EverydayHealth stock at our election.</p>
<p>Additionally if Tea Leaves achieves a specified target of contracted revenue as of the end of 2016, the Company will be required to pay an earnout of an additional $20 million, which would be split evenly between cash and common stock. Given the anticipated growth in the Tea Leaves customer base and contracted revenue, we are very pleased with the financial terms of the acquisition.</p>
<p>Historically, our business is focused on providing digital media solutions to pharma. Over the past year, we have significantly evolved and expanded the company’s set and range of solutions we offer including strategy, creative, licensing and commercialization services and now with Tea Leaves, a SaaS-based marketing and analytic CRM platforms.</p>
<p>Our customer relationships can now involve multiple services and multiple revenue models. And therefore measuring the success we are having with our core customer sets is more indicative of how we are performing than the classification of our revenue between premium services and advertising. As a result of this evolution, a key focus for us is to track our progress across key customer sets including providers. Going forward we will be disclosing to you our performance across these customer sets on a regular basis.</p>
<p>As such, today we are reaffirming the full year revenue guidance we provided back in May, which would imply total revenue growth of 30% at the midpoint and we are now guiding to full-year adjusted EBITDA growth of 33% at the midpoint of the range provided in today’s press release. </p>
<p>With respect to Q3, we are forecasting advertising and revenue – excuse me we are forecasting advertising revenue growth of 42%, total revenue growth of 35% and adjusted EBITDA growth of 40%. As we’ve said to frequently in the past, our long-term adjusted EBITDA margin target is 30% to 35% and the incorporation of Tea Leaves will only advance that objective at greater scale with a new, high growth, high visibility, SaaS-based revenue stream.</p>
<p>We are clearly in the early innings of the evolving digital health marketplace, and Tea Leaves is a clear investment in the future growth of Everyday Health. </p>
<p>Now let me turn it back over to ban for a quick wrap up.</p>
<p><strong>Ben Wolin</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Brian. Clearly the Everyday Health business is having success across numerous fronts with our core pharma customers. And now with Tea Leaves we believe we can extend that success to providers in a large and growing market.</p>
<p>That concludes our prepared remarks and we’ll now open it up for questions.</p>
</div>

<div id="article_qanda" class="content_part hid">
  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your first question comes from the line of Douglas Anmuth of JP Morgan. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Anmuth</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks for taking the question. I just first wanted to ask about Tea Leaves and Brian maybe you can just clarify, I know you said 24 customers with $300,000 plus in annual licensing fees, can you just clarify, is that all the revenue or the bulk of the revenue, or is there more as well that’s smaller here? Maybe I missed kind of an overall number or run rate.</p>
<p>And then can you also talk a little bit more about how that’s going to rebuild kind of the deferred as you take ownership going forward? And then also wanted to clarify if it were not for Tea Leaves, is it correct to say that your EBITDA for the full year essentially would not be changing? And then also if you could give us an update on the Health Reach business, which, I think, you called out as being particularly strong. That would be helpful as well. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Shall I start?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brian Cooper</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, Ben go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. All right I think I got all those questions and thank you. So, you got the numbers right, Tea Leaves has 24 customers averaging 300,000 in annual subscription license fees about 60% of those customers are currently live and in market and that would represent their sort of current run rate of revenue. And the SaaS revenue is the vast majority of the Tea Leaves’ revenue.</p>
<p>With respect to your EBITDA question, yes, we would have been reaffirming the full year EBITDA number that we had previously provided and it is only the Tea Leaves acquisition that is taking us backwards in EBITDA by approximately $3 million.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Douglas Anmuth</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And your next question comes from the line of Stephen Ju from Credit Suisse. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Stephen Ju</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, hi, thanks. So Ben or Brian, so just another sort of follow-up question on Tea Leaves here, so 300,000 in annual subscription fees presumably that’s just for the use of technology and analytics platforms. So, how much in ad dollars do you think the client base is spending at the moment? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brian Cooper</span></strong></p>
<p>And so thanks, Steve and I’ll so also answer Doug’s other question because he got cut off there a little bit. So in terms of those hospital systems, they are spending substantial amounts of marketing to consumers. As we said in the script there’s about $2 billion spent annually by hospital systems Kantar and others estimate about 15% to 20% of that is digital.</p>
<p>So, we are really looking forward to being able to really combine CRM and media together, Tea Leaves business was predominately selling software and service system and we’re going to be able to bring that together with our media business. We also mentioned that about 25% of Tea Leaves customers were already preexisting Everyday Health customers. So we’re going to go to market with a combined offering of media plus CRM. And we think we can also apply that model to customers beyond the provider systems, as well.</p>
<p>In terms of Doug’s other question around Health Reach, I just wanted to mention that that is off to a – that has continued to have strong performance in the first half of the year. It’s where a lot of the video business that we are starting to generate is going through so we’re using our data capabilities retargeting audiences off network, as well as helping TV buyers improve their marketing spend regardless of the screen that they are focused on. So, data and the ability to use that data continues to be a pretty important driver of the revenue for our business?</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>[Operator Instructions] Your next question comes from the line of Mark May from Citi. Your line is now open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark May</span></strong></p>
<p>Hi, thanks for taking my questions. I realize that probably the majority of your revenue is not bought kind of on a spot or auction basis, a lot of it is kind of sponsorships and kind of package deals. But on the outside, you do, do some sort of CPM-based deals and wondered if you’re seeing what some of the other companies are seeing out there in terms of continued display pricing pressure in the market. We got to get your thoughts there.</p>
<p>I think I missed from Brian the timing of the earn-out on the acquisition on Tea Leaves. So, if you could just say that again, is that kind of based on the – your expectations for where you’ll end 2016? Or is it, Which I think you said was 2 X or is it a further earn out period?</p>
<p>And I had one more follow-up if possible.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. I’m going to let Brian handle the timing of the earnout and I’ll handle what’s going on from pricing standpoint in the media market.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brian Cooper</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, so, Mark, the measurement period is as of the of end of 2016 and it will be based on a specified contracted annual recurring revenue at that time. The goal posts that we gave you by doubling it, in order to achieve that earn out which would then be paid in 2017, the acquisition would actually perform, actually better than that. So, we’re really excited about the pipeline, the opportunity, and that we have the right incentives in place to drive this management team.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark May</span></strong></p>
<p>All right. </p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brian Cooper</span></strong></p>
<p>And then, in terms of the CPM environment Mark, I mean, as you said, a large percentage of our business now is not sold in a transactional model when we’re working with these mature brands and to doing outcomes-based programs or if were working with orphan or large specialty drugs, all of that is sold in a very different way. But for the business that is still sold in a more transactional or media model, what we are seeing is a little bit different across the different sub-sections of the business. So, I would say within Pharma, both on the consumer side and the professional side, we see a relatively stable market from a price perspective, I think the big driver there is volume, or sell through and then I would say within CPG and OTC where there is more pressure, we see a more volatile marketplace and that trend really has not changed over the last four to eight quarters. We’ve seen relative stability within Pharma, and much more pressured environment in CPG, OTC and retail.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark May</span></strong></p>
<p>And on a follow-up regarding the acquisition. You talked about the $3 million EBITDA drag for the start period this year, and its kind of doing back at the envelope to try to estimate a little bit as the deferred revenue ramps back up, and you have a more normalized from an accounting standpoint treatment on the P&amp;L save next year in the back half of next year, I’m trying to get a little bit sense of how the margin profile of this business compares with your current margin profile and I guess, ultimately the question is how much sort of variable versus fixed expenses this Tea Leaves how this kind of relative to the Everyday Health business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brian Cooper</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, sure. Mark, you are right, we did talk about that $3 million drag, which will come from really two things – a couples will be this current deferred revenue which will hit both 2015 and also bleed into 2016, as we invest in building out this provider, sales marketing and account management organization. As it continues to ramp. At this point, we’re not ready to provide any type of 2016 guidance yet, but this is a high growth business for – which we think we’ll continue to have high growth in the future and we will be continuing to invest it in the future.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Mark May</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, okay. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Brian Cooper</span></strong></p>
<p>The only other thing that I would just share with you is that we believe that our long-term EBITDA margin target is still even with Tea Leaves in that 30% to 35% and that we’re still will be marching on a path to get there, and with Tea Leaves a greater scale.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And your next question comes from the line of Steve Rubis from Stifel. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Rubis</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks guys for taking my questions. I would like to start with the topic that you’ve talked about of bringing CRM and media together. Can you talk about how those two items have not historically been linked in biopharma and can you talk about your intentions or interests in bringing those two together in biopharma advertising? And then if that is going to need partnership or how much you can do on your own and just anything you can talk about your future strategy bringing those two items together in biopharma would be great.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. Thanks, Steve. If you kind of take a step back and you look at what it takes to commercialize a drug there is really kind of four components. There’s strategies SaaS creative, there is audience you need someone to be able to reach – historically there’s sales force and then there is CRM. And for the most part that those had existed in silos different companies or different vendors providing different solutions to the end customers. From our vantage point our customers want vendor that can bring together multiple solutions across that spectrum.</p>
<p>They really want one vendor to work with and ideally they want someone who can sit on the same side of the table with them and take risks in those types of arrangements. So, bringing together CRM and audience or CRM and media is something that we’re pretty excited about. I think historically like I said those hadn’t really existed under one umbrella inside of the farmer world. And that we think we can go to customers now with a joint offering in which we are not able to identifying the right person is to market to but we can drive them into a CRM that we’re helping manage and then we market to them hopefully driving a more robust ROI for that end customer.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Rubis</span></strong></p>
<p>Got it. That’s very good color. Can you talk about what types of hospitals seem to be most interested in Tea Leaves? Are you looking at academic medical centers, small community access hospitals, and is there an opportunity for you to work with EHR vendors to also sell this product?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. So as you know, Steve, there is about 5,700 hospitals in the market. Half of them fall under a hospital system. Tea Leaves customers actually kind of covers both hospital systems which are aggregations of lots of different hospitals as well as individual hospitals on their own. So the 25 hospitals that we’re working with really encompasses our 25 systems that we’re working with encompasses actually 250 different hospitals. And they really run the gamut from not for profit to core profit in academic medical centers but in all cases all of these hospitals are looking to drive profitable growth and that’s really what they’re using Tea Leaves for, they want to identify a patient population to go after.</p>
<p>They want to drive people into their cardio business or into their pediatrics business. They’re using their own data and other third-party data to target those people and then there using Tea Leaves to execute those marketing programs. And combined with our asset we’re going to give them content to make those marketing programs work even better and then something that no one else in the market can provide is we’re going to allow that CRM to connect directly into the audience that we have so we won’t just be able to identify who the market to and execute the marketing program, will actually have the audience to market to and then be able to measure that actual ROI. So, we’re really excited about the direction of that business in combination with our assets.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Rubis</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Switching gears to biopharma advertising, what product areas or indication areas should we be watching for in the back half of the year to drive growth for your business?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure thanks. Growth is really coming from three main areas in the business Steve, within pharma. First, it’s coming from specialty Pharma. And that’s really category that I think you probably most often see marketed on broadcast television or other digital properties. So, there can be categories like MS or you know the new PCSK9 categories that are starting to emerge in the cardio business.</p>
<p>And so all of the things that RA, Hep C, even HIV, those areas of specialty continue to be strong and robust. Second is really orphan. We are really seeing great progress in the orphan and rare disease category and I think if you looking the just overall Pharma market at all the M&amp;A that is happening so much of that is driven by desire for companies to either improve their orphan business or get into it in the first place. And then last, really, our late stage more mature brands. We’ve been in that business for a while now and those are brands where we take over 100% of the marketing responsibility.</p>
<p>We execute all of their marketing predominantly to professionals that offer to consumers as well. And those are brands that you probably wouldn’t see marketed on television because they’re shutdown their sales force and shut down their broadcast, and they are using us to digitally market. Likely they wouldn’t show up on everydayhealth.com, either or maybe if you did see them you would see them as just a banner ad but we are seeing a lot of progress there and have a nice basket of brands that fit under that category that’s driving the business in the back half of the year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Rubis</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. My last question is can you help us understand what percent of your business today is health reach? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>So we haven’t historically broken out health reaches in the individual line item, what I can tell you that is, it is a growing percentage of the business and is growing faster than the overall business as well.</p>
<p>A couple of things are fitting into health reach, our video product. Anything where we are using our data to market off-network is fitting into that bucket as well.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steve Rubis</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, very much.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And your next question comes from the line of Sandy Draper from SunTrust. Go ahead caller. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sandy Draper</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you very much. Most of my questions have actually been asked but maybe a follow-up on the comment around the Pharma market environment. Nice to see the accelerating growth in the top 30 customers. When you think about the growth, is that really – without having any specific numbers, are you getting more brand buying in? Is it the brands that you are working with going deeper? And I’d be curious sort of the second point would be that takes on specialty DoctorDirectory, a little bit longer how is that going, how is the integration and have you actually started contemplating moving to drill little bit more to at risk revenue for the more traditional – not just the off patent type of drugs. Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thanks, Sandy. So in terms of where the growth coming forward in the top customers that it really is coming from the portfolio broadening. We see nice progress with brands doing repeat business with us but now with numerous customers we really are working across the entire portfolio. So we have a couple of customers that are working with us in everything from orphan to specialty to mass-market to late stage. And that’s really what we strive to have because as you know Pharma really is a brand holding company.</p>
<p>And the companies are operated in new kind of brand silos and what one brand does – it doesn’t necessarily have a huge bearing on what another brand does, but we want to go in to a franchise manager let’s say in the diabetes category and say we can work with you across your entire diabetes franchise whether it’s your new launch, whether it’s for a tiny indication with a small patient population, all the way to the product that you’re going to sunset in the next 2 to 3 years.</p>
<p>So, I would say it’s really about capturing more breadth within these companies. In terms of your other questions around our integrations doctor directory that’s gone really well. We now have that completely integrated and the program that you referenced where we are taking on both full commercialization responsibilities are really running across our entire platform. We see that on Everyday Health. Sometimes we even use our health reach technology to drive that business and we are excited about the progress that we are making. I’d say in all cases our customers are looking for ROI. It comes up in every conversation and almost in every contract that we have.</p>
<p>The pricing model that we work with them is often specific to the situation that exists with that customer and how they want to buy. So even if they are buying on a CPM basis like Mark May mentioned there are often still looking at the ROI. In other cases where we’re getting paid based on the performance of that product it’s obviously – that’s the key pricing model. But we see in general the major trend across our business is to focus on ROI and it’s really why we got so excited about Tea Leaves. It is in essence the exact same thing that we are doing in the Pharma business but applying it to the hospital business. Taking data allowing a healthcare constituent to find the right audience, measure the impact, and look at the ROI and then hopefully keep doing more business with that customer based on their performance.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Sandy Draper</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. That’s really helpful. Thanks, Ben.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Sandy.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your next question comes from the line of Steven Wardell, Leerink Partners. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Wardell</span></strong></p>
<p>Hey guys, thanks for taking my question. Could you give us more color into Pharma brand budget for 2015? What are you seeing? I assume you’re engaging with brand managers all the time and you hearing feedback from them. Do you see at continued shift to digital? Do you see any systematic trends like a shift to spending later in the year? Or do you see any weakness in the Pharma budget this year or next year?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Steven. It’s a little hard to generalize. We see different environments across the different areas of the Pharma. So again I would say in orphan we see a really aggressive marketplace especially if that brand is coming to market or newly to market. Their spending is aggressively as they can to drive the top line of their business. Within specialty, it’s really kind of brand-by-brand and category specific so in some categories like MS you see a very competitive environment. I mentioned PCSK9 that’s going to be a super competitive environment coming up in late 2015 and towards 2016.</p>
<p>And then another parts of mass-market Pharma where maybe they’re the only brand in the marketplace less competitive and less of an urgency to get to market. And then with the late stage brands, there really relying on us to drive that business. They are not – there’s no calendar. They’re not physically oriented because they said let’s replace our sales force or let’s replace our other media spend with Everyday Health. There it’s really – subject to really as quick as we can go with the company rather than what they are calendarize budget is. So, in general we see a pretty robust market with Pharma, with kind of major headlines being looking for efficiency, looking for ROI. And trying to use the best medium that they can to target the right audience.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Steven Wardell</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. Thank you. </p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Your last question comes from the line Charles Rhyee of Cowen and Company. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes. Thanks for taking the question here guys. Just a real quick question about back on Tea Leaves little bit, you talked about how they are targeting high value patients physicians, can you go little bit more on what sources they’re using to identify these patients these patients? Are these patients that have already been through a system for some procedure? How are they identified currently?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks, Charles. Good to hear from you. Great question. So, it’s really the bread and butter of Tea Leaves here is what they do with data. The Tea Leaves combines third-party data with first party data from hospital systems to allow them to do that identification. Specifically what that means on the third-party side, that behavioral data, social data, data from companies like Experian which may have income or DMA information and then on the first party data it’s data from the EMR, its [indiscernible] and then claims data. And it’s really be combination of all of that data set that allows Tea Leaves to figure out who the market to, either on a specific named basis or to develop a model that allows them to perfect their marketing.</p>
<p>So again if you could back to an example of, I want to drive a patient, we want to drive our mammography business, they are not going to be just looking at who is a woman, but they are going to look when with someone last mammography. Are they at high risk? What the payer mix is a huge component for hospital systems. So, some hospital systems are hospitals are specifically targeting Medicaid or Medicare patients some are going after commercial liens [ph]. But it’s really taking this first party data, the claims data and the other third-party data, and combining that data set into one that allows the hospital system to better target the right person.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p>
<p>So then, basically when you’re saying first party data, example, you mentioned advocate. These are patients that have been through the Advocate system once before so they’re within the Advocate EMR and is trying to identify which of the patients that have been to the system, they should be going back to invite them sort of to use Advocate as their primary health care provider.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Correct, they’re going to use the EMR data and the chargemaster. They’re actually looking at a name patient. Are they at risk for a certain condition? What their insurance is because that may dictate whether or not how aggressively that hospital system wants to go after and market towards them. And then they are sort of using that data to decide who to market to two, based on their previous interactions with that patient. And then are using the chargemaster to look at the actual ROI of that marketing campaign because they can see what value does that patient generate downstream.</p>
<p>So in that example that we gave in the script of that hospital in Texas who was marketing its cardio practice, they were out looking for existing patients that were in their system. New patients in that geographic area. Viewing the marketing and then looking at the actual revenue that was generated by that marketing campaign as it showed up in the actual charge map or the financials of that hospital system.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, thanks. And then lastly, how does Tea Leaves – how do you envision Tea Leaves working in the future? If we’re going towards sort of a competition and that risk reimbursement for the providers and if they’re managing specific patient population is it still – is Tea Leaves still a usable function within that kind of environment, just getting somebody to come in is initially what you want because you are trying to sort of reduce cost – how do you see that – Tea Leaves playing into – in the future? Thanks.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Ben Wolin</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, thanks. So the foundation – the major promise of Tea Leaves in our business is that these healthcare constituents, regardless if they are looking to drive volume or they providing value based care, need to communicate with consumers or patients. Even if you are an ACO you still need to drive a beneficial utilization for your hospital and hospital system. And so the technology that Tea Leaves has really allows the hospital to better figure out how to communicate to its patients or potential patients.</p>
<p>And that really can work whether its like is said trying to drive volume of procedures or try to drive the right volume of procedures. And we are going to see this happen not just with hospital systems but with urgent care, with any organization. Even pharmacies and retailers that are trying to drive the right individual back into their environment to get the right type of care.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Charles Rhyee</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay, great. Thanks a lot guys.</p>
