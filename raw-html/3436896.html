<p><strong>Daniel Leever</strong></p>
<p>Thanks, Ban, and good morning, everyone. I’m pleased to report a strong and productive second quarter this morning. The pace activities that has characterize Platform thus far continued in the quarter. In late May, we announced the definitive agreement to acquire OM Group’s Electronic Chemicals and Photomasks businesses, these are assets we have long sort after and there will be a great addition to our existing portfolio.</p>
<p>We properly follow that acquisition with a $483 million equity capital rates to fund working capital and future acquisitions including the OM acquisition, this helps bring our leverage ratio in line with our stated long term goal. Soon thereafter in July, we announced the terms of a recommended offer to acquire all the issued and outstanding shares of Alent Plc, which when completed will be a truly transformational acquisition for our performance applications segment and we’ll bring additional balance to Platform’s overall portfolio. This is a highly complementary business with the strong heritage and we’re excited about the transactions.</p>
<p>With these transactions progressing towards anticipated close in the second half of ’15 and early ’16, we feel very good about the state of this segment and its prospects for growth.</p>
<p>In addition to our recent M&amp;A activity in performance applications end markets, we remain diligently focused on the integration work in that [ph] segment. We are pleased to report and we realized $8 million in synergies in the second quarter or $32 million of annualized synergies up from 5 million of realized synergies in the first quarter.</p>
<p>This progress and stills confidence in our ability to meet our $80 million Ag synergy target, and when you combine this with our 70 million plus of synergies from the performance application segment that we announced these past few months we believe we have a very promising in material earnings growth opportunity, in addition to the underlying growth of our businesses.</p>
<p>The $70 million figure is based on 50 million related to estimated synergies in connection with the land acquisition and 20 million relating to the OM assets, the OM synergy estimate has been reported on by PricewaterhouseCoopers and Credit Suisse in accordance with UK Take Over Regulation. You can see reports and letters from PricewaterhouseCoopers and Credit Suisse confirming the reports on our website.</p>
<p>We are lesser focused on delivering these costs savings for shareholders and pleased with our progress to date, so that's laser focused, clearly we are update about the potential of our expanding businesses and we are keenly aware that our future success will be driven by our best asset, our people. To that affect we have taken proactive steps to strengthen our management structure and to add resources both at the corporate and operating levels of the company.</p>
<p>Wayne Hewett, Platform’s President and the President of our Ag segment will be leading Platform to pursue other opportunities. He has tendered his resignation effective August 28. We thank him for his service and we wish him luck in future endeavors.

<p>In the interim, we’re pleased to announce that Jonathan Evans will service interim President of Agricultural Solutions. He has a strong track record especially chemicals and help build a best in class supply chain for Arysta, a global and complicated operation.</p>
<p>I will be working closely with Jonathan and our Ag's CEO Flavio Prezzi in the months to come. We see lot of opportunities.</p>
<p>We are also very pleased to announce that Frank Monteiro will assume a new role as Chief Operating Officer of MacDermid in our performance application segment. With two pending applications in the segment, he will provide more leadership depth to partner with Scott Benson, President of Performance Applications to oversee the integration and ensure these businesses do not skip a beat.

He will be in a position to focus on the critical value creation opportunities in the business that he knows exceptionally well.</p>
<p>We are very thankful for his contributions as CFO of Platform and MacDermid before that. He has been a key ingredient in our success thus far and will continue to be even more so in his new role. Thank you, Frank.</p>

<p>Results for the second quarter saw good constant currency underlying growth but we are impacted by a strong foreign currency headwind. In the second quarter of 2015 on the actual dollar basis, revenue was 675 million, an increase of 486 million or 257% over last year's 189 million. Adjusted EBITDA was 167 million up 119 million or 248% from 48 million last year.</p>
<p>On a pro forma as-adjusted basis, revenue declined 14% primarily due to strong currency headwinds. Adjusting for FX, constant currency organic pro forma revenue increased 2.5% and constant currency pro forma adjusted EBITDA increased by 5.6%. Adjusted pro forma EPS for the second quarter of 2015 was $0.25 compared to 2014 of $0.31. Recurring free cash flow for the quarter in 2015 was $0.40 against $0.22 last year.</p>
<p>We are particularly pleased to report positive constant currency growth in our Ag business continue for the quarter growing 1.9% over the second quarter of 2014. This is despite many of our competitors demonstrating flat or declining sales and illustrates the success of our S-squared strategy specialty crops and specialty places.</p>
<p>Ag constant currency adjusted EBITDA increased 1.5% in the quarter which includes synergies. Constant currency adjusted EBITDA growth in performance applications segment was again double-digit at 15.2% growth. The performance application segment which currently consist of the MacDermid business had record adjusted EBITDA and its associated margin of over 29% was a best margin quarter ever. This demonstrates the continued operating leverage we are achieving this business.</p>
<p>I am particularly pleased to report to be generating $98 million of adjusted recurring free cash flow in the quarter. As you know we have cash flow focused above all of us and this number is encouraging. We have previously said that the Ag working capital cycle peaks in the middle of the second quarter and releases over the balance of the year, we are seeing that happen now and look forward to continuing to report strong cash flow generation from the business in the back half of the year. Our team is whether in difficult market conditions, in some end markets very well. We are delivering our synergies, building on our capabilities and importantly continue to grow and execute on our strategy.</p>
<p>With that, I’ll turn it over to Frank to walk you through the financial results in more detail. Frank?</p>
<p><strong>Frank Monteiro</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Dan and good morning everyone. As Ben noted, in addition to our actual results, we will be presenting numbers on a pro forma, as-adjusted basis meaning comparisons and analytics for the current and prior year will reflect the combined businesses as if we owned all acquired business units for the full year.</p>
<p>We believe that our reported results only partially reflect the ongoing operations of Platform as they include deal related costs, purchase accounting adjustments and other non-cash items associated with our acquisition strategy whereas our pro forma as-adjusted results provide a clear picture of our underlying businesses and their growth rate. Supplemental slides are posted on our website to assist you in understanding these adjustments.</p>
<p>We are pleased to report a record quarter for Platform. For the quarter ended June 30, 2015 and an actual results basis Platform’s reported revenue with 675 million versus 189 million in the prior year an increase of 486 million. In segment terms, performance applications revenue was 182 million versus a 189 million in 2014 a decline of 8 million or 4%. The Agricultural Solutions segment finish quarter two of 2015 with revenue of 494 million.</p>
<p>On a pro forma as-adjusted basis in actual dollars, Platform had quarter two 2015 revenue of 675 million versus 785 million for the same period in 2014, a decrease of 14% or 110 million. The performance application segment declined 8 million or 4% from 189 million in 2014 to 182 million in 2015 as previously mentioned while Agricultural Solutions segment declined 102 million or 17.2% from the 596 million in 2014 to 494 million in 2015.</p>
<p>As Dan discussed, the strengthening of the U.S. dollar particularly against the Brazilian Real continue to represent a significant headwind to our operations in the second quarter of 2015. On a pro forma as-adjusted basis in constant currency Platform grew revenues by 2.5% or 17 million from 672 million in 2014 to 690 million in 2015. The Performance Application segment increased revenues 4.5% or 8 million on a constant currency basis growing from 174 million in 2014 to 182 million in 2015.</p>
<p>The Agricultural Solutions segment increased revenues 1.9% or $9 million on a constant currency basis from 498 million in 2014 to 507 million in 2015. A constant currency growth in the Ag Solution segment is consistent with what we mentioned in Q1 regarding the full year growth rate expectations.</p>
<p>Platform pro forma as-adjusted EBITDA in reported U.S. dollars for 2015 was 168 million versus 185 million in 2014. On a segment reporting basis, performance applications pro forma as adjusted EBITDA was 54 million, up 3 million or 6.5% over the prior period, while the Agricultural Solution segment reported pro forma as adjusted EBITDA of 114 million which was down 21 million or 15.5% over the prior period. Adjusting for currency effects Platform’s pro forma as adjusted EBITDA for 2015 was 166 million versus a 157 million in 2014, which is up 5.6% or $9 million.</p>
<p>On a segment reporting basis in constant dollars, Performance Applications’ pro forma as-adjusted EBITDA was 54 million which is up 7 million or 15.2% over the prior year period, while the Agricultural Solutions segment reported pro forma as-adjusted EBITDA of 112 million is up 2 million or 1.5% over the prior period.</p>
<p>During second quarter of 2015, we raised 483 million of equity primarily to fund working capital and future acquisitions including depending OM Group transaction. We also implemented a series of interest rate swaps on our current term loan helping to more appropriately balance our fixed versus floating interest rate exposures, while leaving us with flexibility as we look to fund our future deal.</p>
<p>As of June 30, 2015, quarter two net debt was 2.75 billion, which includes 365 million of cash that will be used for the OM transaction. We fixed the portion of our flooring rate debt in early August and so now approximately 80% is fixed while 20% is variable. Based on our current cash flow projections, expected future funding obligation and contemplated capital markets activity, we expect to return to our 4.5 target leverage during 2016. To further that point, we believe there may be a misconception about any equity funding that is needed for the OM transaction.</p>
<p>We have a debt commitment from our banks for the full cash portion of the non-stock purchase price. Our stated long-term goals to keep our leverage ratio at or below 4.5 times but given the strong cash flow characteristics of the businesses, we are very comfortable in carrying higher debt levels for a short period of time as necessary to help fund our acquisition.</p>
<p>These debt levels will come down naturally from the cash flows of the business or should the market conditions be appropriate, we will issue equity to bring that into line with our debt leverage goals more quickly. Recurring free cash flow generation in the second quarter was a strong 98 million or $0.40 per share. As expected working capital peak mid-quarter and has becomes to release.</p>
<p>From an investment standpoint year-to-date CapEx has been 44 million, including 29 million of physical plant and 15 million in registrations. As we integrate the businesses, we continue to focus intensely and improving the working capital and transactional FX exposures and we feel good about the progress that we are making.</p>
<p>On our last call, we talked about FX representing a 10% headwind based on end of February rates. Rates continue to move against this in the second quarter and beyond particularly in Brazil where the quarter two average for the Real was off 8% against end of February rates. By the end of July, the rate have moved 18.5% off of February and its decline has continued.</p>
<p>We have implemented pricing actions, barter transactions, factoring and other mechanisms to mitigate the effects of currency, especially on cash flow and we have see many of these work as planned in the quarter but nonetheless translational effects is negatively impacting our numbers.</p>
<p>As noted in our press release, we have revised our 2015 adjusted EBITDA guidance for the full year 2015 to reflect FX rates at the end of July. Platform’s initial guidance was linked to February foreign exchange rate and the dramatic strengthening of the dollar has led to a significant headwind. Two-thirds of Platform’s Brazilian earnings come in the second half of the year.</p>
<p>Based on end of July foreign exchange rate and excluding any impact from the announce acquisitions that have not closed yet or any softening in the end markets for our Agricultural Solutions product that would be below last year’s levels in the back half for the year, we expect adjusted EBITDA to be in the range of 620 million to 650 million, compared to the initial expectations of 660 million to 680 million.</p>
<p>Any further negative impact from exchange rates including the Real since July is not captured in this revised guidance. Importantly, this guidance range assumes growing conditions particularly in Latin America for the rest of the year are similar to those of last year. Our team in Latin America is confident however we are being cautious. We intend to update 2015 guidance on our Q3 earnings call to refine our full year outlook further based on macro market conditions at that point in time.</p>
<p>Given uncertainty over the closing dates for the announced acquisitions, recent equity financing associated with the OM Group acquisition in additional potential financings for the Alent transaction, Platform’s EPS guidance is no longer applicable and the company intent the issue of revised forecast following the close of the OM Group transaction if required.</p>
<p>I will now turn you back to Dan to give you further updates and concluding remarks. Dan?</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Leever</strong></p>
<p>Thank you, Frank. Both of our segments demonstrated constant currency growth in the second quarter, a challenging macro operating environment, to which no one in our industry is immune, actually showcases the strength of our underlying businesses. We are excited by these challenges as they create opportunities for us. On the Ag side of the business, we have demonstrated our ability to continue to generate underlying growth, despite industry wide headwinds.</p>
<p>We remain committed to our Specialty-Squared strategy, specialty crops and specialty geographies and expect to continue to outperform the overall Ag market which is more dominated by row crops in major markets on that basis. The performance applications business is continuing to be a steady generator for EBITDA and free cash flow and we are energized by the business prospects of soon to be in large segment.</p>
<p>As we said in the call when we announced the Alent transaction, we believe the transaction particularly adds valuable measure string, capabilities, customers, and technologies to Platform and allow us to offer an even greater value to our customers and shareholders. We believe synergy realization is on track in the Ag integration is going well.</p>
<p>Every day we are seeing new opportunities to create more efficient businesses which we’re fully pursuing and in all angles. I’m excited to collaborate with Jonathan Evans Interim President and Flavio Prezzi, COO of the Ag Solutions business, we are 100% aligned behind the strength of the business model and share a passion to make it even better.</p>
<p>With regard to the two pending acquisitions OM Group businesses and Alent, we feel confident with the prior closing guidance we have provided, we are excited to own these businesses in the near future and we’ve been actively engage in internal integration planning as well as keeping contact with the companies as appropriate under the regulations, employees for all the companies are excited about the prospects of a combined business.</p>
<p>As I said in our last call, bidding our synergy targets what dictates our priorities and this remains true today. We have management capacity and performance application business and found compelling value in the two deals we have recently announced for the segment.</p>
<p>In the rest of the year, we will be focused on getting the two transactions over the goal line and making sure that our integrations continue to go right. We are confident in our ability to execute.</p>
<p>To summarize we’re pleased with the quarter, but cautious about the short term outlook. Our business units remain focused on execution and we are building the right team to manage the far larger business we have begun.</p>
<p>There are factors working against us particularly currency and we’re focusing and managing those risks while optimizing the businesses with regard to factors under our control to that giving great products and technology providing best service to our customers ensuring our earnings converted to cash flow consistently at a high rate.</p>
<p>We have significant additional leverage to pull, to further improve our earnings in cash flow, we are in the early days of the Ag integration, I’m confident this business will perform according to our expectations especially in the medium to long term and our business effectiveness initiative only provides upside. I look forward to updating all of you on future calls and with that happy to take your questions.</p>

  <p><strong>Question-and-Answer Session</strong></p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. [Operator Instructions]. Our first question comes from the line of the Jon Tanwanteng with CJS Securities. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Tanwanteng</span></strong></p>
<p>Good morning gentlemen. Welcome to Sanjiv and the rest of you there. Thank you for taking my questions.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Pleasure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Tanwanteng</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m just wondering where Wayne is going and if his departure was as a result of anything within Platform or if it was actually an external decision on his part?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>It was his decision. I don't know where he is going. Just to give you a little bit of background, Platform is very much a collaborative interdependent management structure and when you look at Martin and Martin’s team and myself and Ben and Frank and we really all work in an area its little bit like a private partnership, where we sit around the table and we see who has the expertise and the capacity to work on a certain thing from time to time and it doesn’t always follow the same path from a standpoint of hard organizational line and it's not for everybody. And at the end of the day Wayne wants his own show. And so he left to go find his own show and we wished him a lot of luck.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Tanwanteng</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thanks. And Frank can you quantify the percent of the reduction in these ’15 guidance as a result of foreign exchange as opposed to other end market factors such as demand or mix of price and things like that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>It's driven at this point by the FX, there is a customer in the U.S. in North America specifically, I believe it's about $10 million of revenue that's going to affect 2015 that we did lose. But we have a lot of opportunity to gain that customer back in 2016 and we are focused on that at this point.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Tanwanteng</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. So you would say virtually all?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>Most, I would say most.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Tanwanteng</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Got it. And can you further update us on what kind of sensitivity your earnings or EBITDA might have to top to towards currencies in your portfolio. I know you have a lot in there, but Real or Euros or yens, what percent reduction in each of those currencies as a result change in EBITDA?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>So I would say that the biggest change in our guidance is driven by the Real. I mean if you just look at how currencies have performed since February there's been not too much movement in most of the major currencies or the exception of the Real and that's just driving this.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Jon Tanwanteng</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And finally if you can, could you update us on the expected amount of the equity component of the Alent transaction as you envision it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Sure. And so this is driven by several variables including timing of close and the market condition. But the way that we think about this will be financing off of end of 2015 EBITDA with the benefit of synergy that we expect to realize in 2015. So that should be the EBITDA component which you multiplied by first 4.5 times or so. And we expect to generate significant free cash flow from this business from the Platform business and Alent which stays in that business assuming the deal closes prior to June.</p>
<p>So that reduces the net debt balance on our balance sheet and so solving for that EBITDA component and our net debt you can triangulate significant debt headroom and then solve for equity, we can't give much more guidance around numbers because of UK regulations, but I would say that it's far inside of the $1 billion which was mentioned on our Alent call a few months back, it is a much more manageable quantum. </p>
<p>And I think as Frank suggested we a full debt commitments, if the marking editions are not right, we can work with it.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of John McNulty with Credit Suisse. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John McNulty</span></strong></p>
<p>So I guess a couple on the respective businesses. The performance business, I mean I think we have this question last quarter when the numbers or the margins looked surprisingly even higher than we expected this time, they took another step up and I guess I am wondering what's driving the margin improvement in the performance segment. Is it some mix related things? Are you seeing better price? What's driving that profitability and I guess how should we be thinking about that level of profits going forward?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>It's all driven by new products that have been successful. So all of the margin growth comes from new products at higher margins and we think it's sustainable.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John McNulty</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And then maybe you can give us an update just in that segment in terms of, I know it does have some energy exposure and energy has certainly tripped up other throughout the quarter. I guess maybe you can give us an update as to what you are seeing tied to your energy markets, if you have really kind of felt any of the pressures around or that you got something to come or it's something you can kind of whether and we should not necessarily be worrying about it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>It really has not impacted us that much, because in the past we are able to surcharge energy components when they came through, for example from our raw material vendors and stuff like that but specifically as it relates to our business, our offshore solution product offering is having a banner year much better than we would have expected. There is some affect on our industrial business that supports onshore oil and gas plating, but that's being offset by growth in the industrial end markets that relate to auto mode.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John McNulty</span></strong></p>
<p>And then on the Ag fund, can you give us a little bit color in terms of, you saw the FX moves, I guess can you walk us through maybe either geographically or by kind of larger crop segment just how we should think about the volume growth that you are enjoying in those businesses?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. So Europe very strong at a good year in Europe essentially years down in Europe. So that’s in the books and it was strong. Latin America strong, doing well in Latin America, really especially crop focus and really the combination of the sales forces from these respected companies are showing additional business there, so that was good. Africa drought not good and North America, lot of headwinds in North America, not good at all, I mean really not good and in Asia okay.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John McNulty</span></strong></p>
<p>And then just maybe one last question on the cash flows since the numbers came in, I think better than what we were looking for. It doesn’t seem like there is any bad debt issues or payment issues, I know there has been concerns about that giving your Brazilian exposure. But can you give us kind of an update as to, what you are seeing on that front and then also what’s driving the incremental cash flow coming in better than this, it certainly relative to EBITDA, it definitely came in better than what we were expecting so maybe a little bit of color around that, it will be helpful.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>I’m going to let Frank comment on the bad debt part, but I can tell you that we’re going to generate free cash flow at a higher rate than anybody expects in this business because that’s what we do, that’s quite end of story. But Frank talk about the…</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>Everyone in the customers where we did have concerns we’ve been able to work through, so it has not impacted us per say. We did have some stuff that we didn’t hear it as a related to when the acquisitions were done, which we were fully reserved for. But even those, I mean we’ve managed through very well what we’re getting payment on them.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Roberts</span></strong></p>
<p>The 98 million adjusted recurring free cash flow or the $0.40 a share. Is there any way to think about the foreign exchange effect on that since that’s also got at least some hedging based on working capital and capital spending is there? And then as a follow-up to that, is there any way to annualize that number to get a sense of a full year run rate or we just have to way to see with the back half looks like?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>The FX piece, I mean we have to work through, so I mean we can get to that information.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Roberts</span></strong></p>
<p>But it would be less than it is on the earnings, I would assume so.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>We started putting some stuff in place but we have to take that into account. So once we flow that through we’ll be able to give you that answer.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>But you’re right to say, we’ll be less for sure. Because there is lots of mitigating strategies that we’ve done. So yes for sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>With regard just seasonality. As we’ve communicated in the past, we build working capital through the first five or so months of the year and then it releases. It’s difficult though to annualize any of these specific numbers just on the basis of the seasonality. And so I’m not sure, I would do that.</p>

<p>Next question comes from the line of Duffy Fischer with Barclays. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Duffy Fischer</span></strong></p>
<p>Just if we look at the mid-point of the old EBITDA guidance, the mid-point of new EBITDA guidance, we’re basically down 5% or so. With that be about what the free cash flow would be down? I mean obviously you didn’t give us but in your models is that down roughly the same or would that be down more less?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re all thinking here.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>I’d say, it’s a reasonable assumption that will be down about the same.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Should be about the same.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Duffy Fischer</span></strong></p>
<p>And then can you walk us through, how you guys are thinking about the fall season in Latin America in particular. Obviously a lot of moving pieces in parts often times you give pricing when RID values, because farmer sale into a dollar market. So when you at that generally how do you look at the conditions this fall there. And then how are you going to protect I guess your cash flow in that if you make a sale, your charges in Q3 and Q4, you may not collect that to Q1 if the Real continues to be value, are you looking to hedge more than historically or you’re going to take that risks or how is that part of the working capital going to be got it I guess?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>I would I just start by saying that the guys in Latin America are really confident about making budget, I mean we’re little more cautious and we’ve actually gone back to them and given them a free pass to be able to change their numbers over and over again and they say, no, no, no they think they’re going to make it. There is some phenomenon particularly in the North of Brazil where the season starts late so that volume got shifted into the second half.</p>
<p>So that's going to make the second half somewhat better than it would have been otherwise, and we are laser focused on the foreign exchange transactional risk on this business and we’ve got all kind of stretch we’re putting in place, we’re doing dollar sales, we’re doing hedging, we’re doing barter, we’re really working it and we, up to now have been able to avoid all of the exposure from a transactional standpoint, can we do that for this growing season a 100%? I can’t say that we can guarantee that, but we’re going to largely mitigate the transactional cash at least tell you that.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Duffy Fischer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Great and then just a last one from me, in general how would you characterize the inventory levels of your product kind of in the distribution channel today?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>High. High-ish at least they are tied to be low.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Duffy Fischer</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Its inline with industry or do you think you are even higher than industry?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>No, no, no I think maybe lower than industry, but higher than we’d like.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Aleksey Yefremov with Nomura Securities. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>My first question is on within performance applications, could you comment on the broader outlook for semiconductor demand and how that affects Electronic Solutions?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>There is really no connection with semiconductor demand in electronic solutions, the numbers you need to look at are pretty wiring board production not semiconductor, which are far-far less volatile than the semiconductor build. And that’s the information out there and it is available and it's a little soft right now but I mean that's the reality of it is but nothing to get overly concerned about it, decent, we’re going to have a great year in performance application this year.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>And do you expect the exposure to change with Alent or to be about the same?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Yes, it will change them with Alent for sure. Alent has damascene copper which goes directly into the semiconductor space, but it’s fairly small, it’s not a huge number and then they also are much heavily involved in electronic assembly than we are. So there are definitely areas that are little bit difference than our electronic business for sure. And there will be, I wish a more exposure, but not hugely more exposure to semiconductor cycle.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Unidentified Analyst</span></strong></p>
<p>Great, thanks. And then Ag you mentioned the pricing initiatives, so do you expect your sensitivity FX changes to less in second quarter and can you kind of help us think about quantifying that?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>I know I think there is two ways to think about ones transactional, ones translational, so from a transactional standpoint we’ve been able to up to now 100% mitigate the exposure from that. Like I said a minute ago, I’m not sure we can guarantee a 100% going forward, but it’s going to be largely mitigated and then the translational, I mean it is what it is, we are going to be impacted by the translational effect that really not much we can do about that.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Roger Smith with Bank of America Merrill Lynch. Your line is open.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Roger Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>I wonder if you can talk a little more about what is driving the constant currency increase performance applications on year-over-year, was it the new products you spoke about, was it underlying market growth, are you taking share?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>No, I think the market is soft, I wouldn’t say it soft to the extent that it’s like way down or anything, but its not growing much we are a bit of a down cycle in China particularly right now in electronics but we’re having real success in new products. I mean, it’s probably not fair to say it’s all that but a large part of it, a new products in electronics, but we’re also having a really good year in the offshore fluids part which is driven by the long CapEx cycle in the production business for oil and gas. So this deep offshore production assets take years and billions of dollar to build, we can’t just shut them off one day to the next, so they are still coming online as we see it now and so that's driving some growth this year in the market and you have got otherwise to look at and say boy, it got to be down and it's just not.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Roger Smith</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. And similar question on Ag solutions, what's driving that year-over-year growth? Is it the synergies putting these pieces together, again taking share or underlying market growth?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Frank Monteiro</span></strong></p>
<p>So certainly there is a synergy component, as we noted, we realized $8 million synergies in quarter where we are at about $13 on the year so that helps and then we have some really strong products and as Dan talked about a strong season in Europe, things in LatAm are good thus far balanced by some weakness in North America and Africa.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>And our next question comes from the line of Chris Shaw with Moness, Cresspi. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Shaw</span></strong></p>
<p>I might have missed it, specifically on Ag, did you guys actually breakup the price volume in the quarter, I was just kind of isolate maybe sort of pricing impact from the Real devaluation?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>That's not something we have provided in this quarter or in prior quarters.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Shaw</span></strong></p>
<p>Got you. And Dan can you give us talk about both the timeline and sort of your view on any tress process or the Alent deal, I guess both in United States and in Europe maybe?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Since there are a handful of jurisdictions in which we have regulatory filings indicated on the basis of that transaction. Some of those jurisdictions are more opaque than other with regards to the timing. So we have communicated with regard to closing that transaction is end of this year or early next year. At this stage we have done some of those filings, not all of them. And John has an update to provide with regards to refining that outlook.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Chris Shaw</span></strong></p>
<p>And just can you talk to like what's your confidence in getting the approvals and sort of what the shares will sort of be like or just high unit processes.</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>So probably not going to talk about market-shares, but we would not have signed up this transaction if we did not think regulatory was manageable. And so we remain optimistic in that regard.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question comes from the line of Bill Huffman with RBC Capital Markets. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Huffman</span></strong></p>
<p>Just a little bit more on Ag business you guys talked about having sort of heavier inventory load heading into the seasonally weaker second half of the year, I just wondering if you can talk a little bit about how you expect that impact the business margins in the work. Also the work capital as we typically see in the second half?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>We expect to see good margins. So we have been seeing good margins all the year. We have a mix deal going on where the higher profitability products are being emphasized and we are seeing more sales of them at the expenses some of the lower margin products. So we expect that to continue. So we have got a pretty heavy second half of the year wait in Brazil in weight where the margins are good. We do not expect to see that change as a result of the dollar at all really. </p>
<p>So I mean we are cautious about the volume in the second half of the year. But caution is the right word and we are not sending or waving the red flag at this point at all. We are like I said at the end of the first quarter I think it's worth repeating is I said, wow, it was a really great quarter. And in the agriculture business, you are dealing with weather issues, you are dealing with past some years that show up, some years that do not show up and there is so many variable that it's really difficult. And if you ask me about performance materials in the second half of the year, I can tell you with a lot of clarity with the volumes there, in Ag we can't do that.</p>
<p>So we are sitting here saying what we think the second half of the year is without any idea what weather is going to be. And it can have a huge impact on the second half of the year. So we are confident based on everything we know as long as just not some really diverse weather event. And if there is, that's going to hurt, but all in all we expect it to be a little softer than we felt to the last time we talked about that way -- than we were last night.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Huffman</span></strong></p>
<p>Great. And are you seeing any pricing pressure on the Ag chemical of it?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>There is always pricing pressure, ebbs and flows and we are not seeing anything out of the ordinary for sure.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">Bill Huffman</span></strong></p>
<p>Okay. Thank you. And then last question from a capital spending standpoint, any thoughts for the full year '15 and maybe looking forward into ’16 on the core business that you have today?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Well, we’ve given guidance at the Investor Day on CapEx, I don’t think that’s change at all and we see upside opportunity in ’16 for sure.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Our next question is a follow-up from the line of John Roberts with UBS. Your line is open. Please go ahead.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Roberts</span></strong></p>
<p>I believe oilfield services chemical was a potential Platform area of interest for you. With oil prices weakening again here would you entertain a good deal in that space or something came along or do you have too much in your plate right now?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>We’re pretty busy. We’ve got as you know many-many tens of millions of synergy opportunities in front of us, I mean that’s what we’re focused now. We should never say never particularly when you’re doing our Chairman Martin Franklin. But I can tell you that we’re really focused on. We think we have huge opportunities here relative to synergies and making these businesses better. I am super chase about getting more involved in the Ag business and working closely with the management team there and I see big upside opportunities that’s we’re focused on right now.</p>
<p><strong><span class="question">John Roberts</span></strong></p>
<p>Maybe I’ve just add to follow-up and you said you’re looking for a new head at the Ag division but you’re not replacing the President role, wouldn’t having a president allow you to focus more on the portfolio issues and free you up from becoming bought down and operations?</p>
<p><strong><span class="answer">Daniel Leever</span></strong></p>
<p>Well things have been flow, I mean right now operations is where the money is. And we’re focusing an operations in the short-term, because there is so much upside opportunity, but ultimately our business model is that we’re going to have President, who run the business as we don’t require a lot of involvement from corporate and that’s part of the reason we’re moving Frank over to partner up with Scott Benson. I mean those two guys only help for me I can tell you. And when we get a President and Ag Solutions business, he is not going to need help for me either. But for right now, yes, right now I am spent a lot of time on that.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Thank you. And that does conclude today’s Q&amp;A portion of the call. I would like to turn the call back over to Dan Leever, Platform’s CEO for any closing remarks.</p>
<p><strong>Daniel Leever </strong></p>
<p>First of all, I’d like to thank everybody and I hope you get the sense from this call that we’re pretty excited about where we go next. One clarification point that I wanted to make that Frank pointed out a few minutes ago is the Performance Applications grow, there is an automotive component that is going well this year, so I should have point that out when I did.</p>
<p>So in general, we’re pretty jazzed about how things are going, we have some short-term issues, we’re going to fight through and we got leverage to pull and then some. This business effective thing is a big deal maybe not in immediate future, but pretty soon it is and we look forward to tell you more about that overtime. So with that, I’d like to thank you all for joining us today. Bye now.</p>
<p><strong>Operator</strong></p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, thank you for participating in today’s conference. This does conclude today’s program. You may all disconnect. Everyone have a great day.</p>
